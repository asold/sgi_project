Detection of copy number variants (CNV) within WES data\nhave become possible through the development of various algorithms and software programs that utilize read-\ndepth as the main information. The aim of this study was to evaluate three commonly used, WES read-depth based\nCNV detection programs using high-resolution chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) as a standard.\nMethods: Paired CMA and WES data were acquired for 45 samples. A total of 219 CNVs (size ranged from 2.3 kb –\n35 mb) identified on three CMA platforms (Affymetrix, Agilent and Illumina) were used as standards. CNVs were\ncalled from WES data using XHMM, CoNIFER, and CNVnator with modified settings.\nResults: All three software packages detected an elevated proportion of small variants (< 20 kb) compared to CMA.\nXHMM and CoNIFER had poor detection sensitivity (22.2 and 14.6%), which correlated with the number of\ncapturing probes involved. CNVnator detected most variants and had better sensitivity (87.7%); however, suffered\nfrom an overwhelming detection of small CNVs below 20 kb, which required further confirmation. Size estimation\nof variants was exaggerated by CNVnator and understated by XHMM and CoNIFER.\nConclusion: Low concordances of CNV, detected by three different read-depth based programs, indicate the\nimmature status of WES-based CNV detection. Low sensitivity and uncertain specificity of WES-based CNV detection\nin comparison with CMA based CNV detection suggests that CMA will continue to play an important role in\ndetecting clinical grade CNV in the NGS era, which is largely based on WES.\nKeywords: Clinical sequencing, Copy number variants, Whole exome sequencing, Structural variation\nBackground\nCopy number variants are important human genomic\nvariants known to be responsible for Mendelian disor-\nders as well as for common genetic conditions such as\nautism, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia [1 – 3].\nChromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) has demon-\nstrated its technical validity and has remained the\nmethod of choice for the detection of genome-wide copy\nnumber variants (CNVs) in clinical settings. It has also\ndemonstrated its clinical validity for both pre- and\npostnatal diagnostic testing [4, 5]. CMA is currently\nregarded as the gold standard for detection of CNVs that\nrange from several kilobases to several megabases in size\n[6, 7].\nThe advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) tech-\nnology has dramatically improved our capability for\nexamining small-scale sequence variants; it has also pro-\nvided new options for the evaluation of large scale struc-\ntural variants such as CNVs [8]. Whole-exome\nsequencing (WES) has been accepted as the most com-\nprehensive test currently implemented in the clinical set-\nting for small sequence variants [9, 10]. Much effort has\nbeen focused to generate CNV information from WES\ndata [11]; however, low sensitivity and high false positive\nrates have been reported in previous studies using\n* Correspondence: yiping.shen@childrens.harvard.edu\n1Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory,\nShanghai Children ’s Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of\nMedicine, Shanghai 200127, China\n2Boston Children ’s Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Thus, its technical validity has yet\nto be thoroughly evaluated.\nHere, we evaluated three representative and popular\nread-depth based CNV detection programs: the eXome-\nHidden Markov Model (XHMM), the Copy Number In-\nference From Exome Reads (CoNIFER), and CNVnator\nusing clinical grade WES data. XHMM and CoNIFER\ndetect rare CNVs based on a batched-comparison\nprinciple, while CNVnator detects CNVs based on a\nmean-shift approach within single samples. CNVs de-\ntected from the CMA platform were used as reference\nstandard.\nMethods\nSamples and ethics statement\nA total of 45 clinical diagnostic samples were enrolled\nfrom the Shanghai Children ’s Medical Centre and the\nMaternal and Child Health Hospital of the Guangxi\nZhuang autonomous region with the approval of re-\nspective institutional ethics review committees. Genomic\nDNA was extracted using the QIAamp Blood DNA Mini\nkit® (Qiagen GMBH, Hilden, Germany).\nWES and WES-based CNV detection\nExome targets were captured using the Agilent SureSe-\nlect Human All Exon V4 or V5 kit (Agilent Technolo-\ngies, Santa Clara, CA). Raw sequencing data (FASTQ\nformat) were generated via the Illumina HiSeq 2000\nplatform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). The Burrows\nWheeler Alignment tool (BWA) v0.2.10 [17] was\nemployed for sequencing data alignment to the Human\nReference Genome (NCBI build 37, hg 19). All data were\nassessed using FastQC (version 0.11.2) (http://\nwww.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) for\nquality.\nCNVs were generated using the following three CNV\ndetection programs: (1) XHMM v1.0 [18], (2) CoNIFER\nv0.2.2 [19], and (3) CNVnator v0.2.7 [20]. XHMM in-\ncludes several analytic steps and involves a number of\nparameters. In our study, we set all parameters to default\n(minTargetSize: 10; maxTargetSize: 10,000; minMean-\nTargetRD: 10; maxMeanTargetRD: 500; minMeanSam-\npleRD: 25; maxMeanSampleRD: 20; maxSdSampleRD:\n150) for filtering samples and targets, and prepared the\ndata for normalization via XHMM. The only param-\neter that could be adjusted on Conifer was SVD,\nw h i c hw a ss e tt o1 .F o rC N V n a t o r ,w es e tt h eb i n\nsize to 50 – 60 according to the average coverage\ndepth of our sequencing data (45 – 70 X). XHMM and\nCoNIFER used a pooled sample calling approach as\ninput, and CNVnator called CNVs sample by sample\nafter individually generating a baseline.\nCMA and CMA-based CNV detection\nCMA were performed using three different array plat-\nforms including the SurePrint G3 customized array (Agi-\nlent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), CytoScan HD\n(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and Infinium iSelect HD\nand HTS Custom Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina, San\nDiego, CA). Prior validated settings for each platform\nwere consistently utilized for CNV detection and filtering.\nCNVs in the size range of 2 kb – 400 kb were detected via\nCMA and were further confirmed by manual inspection.\nResults\nQuality control of WES data\nFourteen samples were prepared using the Agilent Sure-\nSelect Human All Exon V4 kit and the remaining sam-\nples were prepared using the V5 kit. The mean read\ndepth of all samples ranged around 50 X and the average\nread quality was well above the standard of 20 X. Details\nof sequence data are available in the supplemental data\n(Additional file 1: Table S1).\nSize distribution of CNV detected via CMA and WES\nA total of 219 CNVs were detected via CMA from all\nsamples. Forty-eight CNVs were located in regions that\nhad no exome capture probes; consequently, they were\nremoved from being used as true CNVs when comparing\ndata between CMA and NGS. The remaining 171 CNVs\nwere in regions involving at least one exon. The CNVs\nwere examined and compared for size distribution, de-\ntection sensitivity, boundaries, and overlap among three\nprograms and between two platforms.\n1. CNV size\nWe arbitrarily constructed six size bins as shown in\nFig. 1. The largest portion (37.9%) of CNV detected by\nCMA ranged within 100 – 500 kb whereas CNV detected\nby NGS data were of much smaller size; 35.3, 44.5 and\n79.5% of CNVs were detected by XHMM, CoNIFER,\nand CNVnator, respectively and belong to the 0 – 20 kb\nbin. CNVnator in particular detected many smaller\nCNVs (42.2% below 10 kb, 27.3% below 5 kb).\n2. Detection sensitivity\nWe defined the detection of any particular CNV when\nthere was a 50% overlap with a CNV detected via CMA.\nUsing this definition for the presence/absence of CNV,\n25, 38, and 150 CNVs were found to be detected by\nCoNIFER, XHMM, and CNVnator respectively; thus,\nthe detection sensitivities of three programs were 14.6,\n22.2 and 87.7%, respectively. CoNIFER and XHMM have\nan even poorer detection sensitivity for smaller CNVs in-\nvolving fewer capturing probes, whereas CNVnator had\nYao et al. Molecular Cytogenetics  (2017) 10:30 Page 2 of 7\na rather consistent detection sensitivity for all size CNVs\n(> 3 kb) (Fig. 2).\n3. Precision of CNV detection\nAmong the 171 variants detected by CMA, 152 variants\nwere detected by at least one WES program. Forty-six vari-\nants were detected by XHMM and CoNIFER, which are\nshown in Fig. 3(A). We plotted the size ratio of those de-\ntected from three programs, using CMA as reference.\nXHMM and CoNIFER detected more accurate size of vari-\nants, while CNVnator reported a significantly larger CNV\nsize (Fig. 3(B)).\n4. Characteristics of CNV missed by exome data\n(Fig. 3 (C))\nA large number of CNVs (125) were missed by CoNI-\nFER and XHMM combined detection and were further in-\nvestigated. The WES read coverage and capture probes\ndistribution were insufficient for both CoNIFER and\nXHMM detection of 42 CNVs. XHMM and CoNIFER\nautomatically filtered capturing probes located in the re-\ngion within recurrent CNV detected in the same batch;\nthus, 43 variants were missed and had to be confirmed\nwith involving probes. Details of all 171 variants are avail-\nable in the supplemental data (Additional file 2: Table S2).\n5. Poor concordance among three programs (Fig. 3\n(D))\nAlthough CoNIFER and XHMM used a similar batched\ninput approach, poor CNV detection concordance was\nFig. 1 Number and size distribution of CNVs detected by CMA, XHMM, CoNIFER, and CNVnator\nFig. 2 Sensitivity of three tools with different probe numbers within variants\nYao et al. Molecular Cytogenetics  (2017) 10:30 Page 3 of 7\nstill identified in our study. CNVnator discovered most\nvariants and covered most variants that could be detected\nthrough WES data. Only 17 CNVs were detected by all\nthree programs.\n6. Detection of clinical relevant variants\nAll variants were evaluated with our in-house standard\nfor clinical relevant variants and eight CNVs were cate-\ngorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants ran-\nging from 306 kb – 35 mb. Six of these variants were\ndetected by WES programs. A 306 kb variant on\nchromosome 3 remained undetected due to particularly\nlow capture probe coverage within the variant region.\nAnother 11 mb variant on chromosome 2 remained un-\ndetected despite sufficient capture probes and depth\ncoverage (Additional file 3: Table S3).\nDiscussion\nCopy number variants (CNVs) are a very important tar-\nget in the clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases. CMA\nhas been proven as the most stable and accurate plat-\nform for CNV detection and has been implemented as a\nclinical test for more than a decade. NGS now provided\na new approach for detecting CNV, which can poten-\ntially replace CMA. Before implementing NGS-based\nCNV detection, extensive validation is required to evalu-\nate the validity of the new method.\nNumerous WES based CNV detection programs have\nbeen developed, including the 15 read-depth based CNV\ndetection tools currently available [21]. We selected\nthree representative and well-known methods for this\nstudy. XHMM is the most commonly accepted software,\nwhich employs the classical hidden Markov model\n(HMM) for CNV identification and achieves a sensitivity\nof 8 – 14% via XHMM, reported against CNV detection\nbased on WGS data [13]. The XHMM framework starts\nwith aligned BAM files to calculate the depth of cover-\nage; then, utilizing normalized read depths via principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA). Finally, XHMM uses the\nnormalized data to train and run a Hidden Markov\nModel (HMM) for CNV detection. CoNIFER was the\nfirst developed tool to deal with rare CNVs from mul-\ntiple samples and has been chosen as representative soft-\nware, which can be used as reference in evaluating other\nnew softwares [22]. CoNIFER calculates the RPKM\nFig. 3 Evaluation of three CNV detection programs (XHMM, CoNIFER, and CNVnator) using clinical grade paired WES and CMA datasets.

An overlapping CNV was defined as at least one exon that shared at least 50%\nof its overall length within a CNV region called by different tools\nYao et al. Molecular Cytogenetics  (2017) 10:30 Page 4 of 7\n(reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) values for\neach sample, and utilizes the singular value decompos-\nition (SVD) method (originating from linear algebra) to\nreduce data dimensions for detecting obvious CNV sig-\nnals. Evaluation against the array CGH platform in\nbreast cancer samples characterized CoNIFER as leading\nto high false positives, low sensitivity, and obvious dupli-\ncation bias [11]. Another study showed that CoNIFER\nachieves higher precision, but at a cost of reduced sensi-\ntivity below 5% [13]. XHMM and CoNIFER have been\nevaluated in parallel in patients with nonsyndromic\nhearing loss showing poor concordance on size of de-\ntected CNV [23]. However, both tools are noted for ad-\nvantages of identification of rare CNV from a population\nof WES samples [24]. CNVnator was previously used in\nwhole genome data for CNVs identification based on\nread depth, and was accessed to achieve better reso-\nlution of CNV borders than the other WGS data-based\ntools [25]. The main methodology for CNVnator is a\nmean-shift. The software first divides the whole genome\ninto equal sized, non-overlapping bins, and treats the\nmapped reads of each bin as a read depth signal. To esti-\nmate copy number change in each genome segment, it\nthen calculates the P-value for a one-sample t-test, test-\ning whether the mean RD signal of a segment would be\nclose to the genome average. In a comprehensive com-\nparison study, CNVnator was accessed to be outstanding\nin break point position and copy number estimation;\nhowever, disconcordance of variants was also discovered\namong all tools evaluated in the study [26].\nIn our study, large differences were observed in num-\nber and size distribution of CNVs detected from CMA\nand three WES based tools. Microarray platforms have a\nsmaller capacity to detect small variants that are not\ncovered by a sufficient number of probes. Several studies\nhave tried to understand the roles of these small vari-\nants. The detection of small, non-recurrent pathogenic\nor likely pathogenic CNVs could help to increase the\ndiagnostic yield of CMA clinical testing by ~3% [27, 28].\nWES-based tools, such as XHMM and CoNIFER, are\ncapable of detecting small variants as long as a sufficient\nnumber of capturing probes (> 10) are covered in the re-\ngion and enable a sensitivity of 14.6 and 22.2%, respect-\nively, indicating the importance of probe number for\nCNVs detection. The overwhelming number of variants\nCNVnator detected from samples was due to the ex-\ntreme resolution of the algorithm [19]. This extreme\nresolution is affected by sequencing depth and high\nresolution could result in splitting large CNVs into small\npieces, which are more sensitive in detecting smaller\nvariants. Larger bin size setting in CNVnator could help\nto merge consecutive small CNVs as integrated variants;\nhowever, this parameter was limited by the average se-\nquencing depth of our clinical WES data.\n125 CMA confirmed CNVs that were not detected by\nXHMM and CoNIFER were further investigated for pos-\nsible explanations. Low sequencing depth (< 10 X) and\nlimited capture probes (< 10) were detected in 42 vari-\nants and these regions were automatically excluded dur-\ning the normalization step of both tools. The detection\nfor these CNV may be improved if sequence depth in-\ncreased. The programs filter out capture probes located\nin recurrent variants that detected the same batch dur-\ning data processing; thus, 43 polymorphism CNVs were\nneglected during the detection, which was also con-\nfirmed by our in-house array database [http://databa-\nse.gdg-fudan.org/DB_HTML/DataSub.html]. Thus, only\n40 (23.4%) CNVs remained theoretically undetected.\nLimitation of sample number and sequencing depth of\nXHMM and CoNIFER could be a possible explanation\nof these undetected variants. CoNIFER requires at least\n50 million mapped reads and a minimum of eight exome\nsamples to run at a time, while XHMM recommends\n~50 exome samples with at least 60 – 100 X coverage [18,\n29]. Characteristics of samples in each batch also con-\ntribute to the effectiveness of CNV detection in XHMM\nand CoNIFER. Recurrent pathogenic or likely pathogenic\nvariants may be filtered out erroneously, if they existed\nin multiple samples; therefore, including non-abnormal\nreference samples as part of the batch could help to de-\ntect these CNVs. Conservative predefined thresholds in\ndefault settings of the CoNIFER might be a further rea-\nson for missing variants. Read-depth based tools are\nfairly limited to repeated regions of the reference gen-\nome [30]; thus, the sequence nature of specific locations\nalso hinders detection of variants. CNVnator was de-\nsigned for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-\ndepth analysis based on a mean-shift approach. The\nnumber of nucleotides covered in each shift is called bin\nsize (50 – 60 in our study), which can be determined by\nthe average coverage of sequencing data (45 – 70 for our\nsamples). CNVnator had the highest sensitivity of 87.7%\nsince 150 of 171 CMA confirmed variants were detected\nby CNVnator. A Venn diagram was used to show the\npoor disconcordance among WES based tools, which\nwas attributed to unsatisfying sequencing depth and\ninadequate number of batched samples. Therefore,\nCNV detection from WES based tools was affected by\nthe following factors (ranked in the order of import-\nance): probe number, reading depth, sample constitu-\nent in the batch, software parameters, and sequence\nnature of variants.\nUsing CMA detected variants as standard, the three\ntested WES based CNV detecting tools were not able to\ndetect the accurate size of variants from WES data.\nXHMM and CoNIFER have lower sensitivity, but more\naccurate size of CNVs compared to CNVnator. CNVna-\ntor reached higher sensitivity at the cost of high false\nYao et al. Molecular Cytogenetics  (2017) 10:30 Page 5 of 7\npositive rates and exaggerated readout of the variant\nsize. Poor concordance of CNV detection was observed\nin the study. Increasing the number of batch samples\nand valid sequencing depth were the most realizable ap-\nproaches to improve performance of these WES based\ntools. At this stage, CMA still remains the first-choice\nand gold standard for CNV detection for clinical diag-\nnostic purpose. CNV detection tools using WES data\ncould be used as a screening tool.\nConclusion\nLow concordances of CNV detection were observed via\nthree different read-depth based programs indicating\nthat WES-based CNV detection still remains immature\nand unstable compared to CMA. Since WES based CNV\ndetection was evaluated to have low sensitivity and un-\ncertain specificity in comparison with CMA based CNV\ndetection, CMA will continue to play an important role\nin detecting clinical grade CNV in the NGS era, which is\nlargely based on WES. CNV detection tools using WES\ndata could be considered as a complementary way with\nonly computational effort, but where further validation\nhas been suggested for the purpose of clinical diagnosis.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Details and quality control information of sequencing\ndata.
