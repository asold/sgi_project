Zahn \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology \nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science \nLaboratory for Ellectromagnetic and Electronic Systems \nCambridge, MA 02139, U.S.A. \nAbstract \nThe moisture diffusion process is measuredl for oil- \nfree transformer pressboard using a flexible interdigi- \ntal dielectrometry three-wavelength sensor. Experiments \nare performed for five different temperatures at various \nmoisture levels. The diffusion coefficient as a function \nof temperature and moisture concentration is estimated \nand compared with literature values. The numerical \nmethods of solving the diffusion equation are discussed. \nIntroduction \nInterdigital frequency-wavenumber dielectrctmetry is \nbased on the excitation of several sets of spatially pe- \nriodic interdigitated electrodes with a sinusoidal volt- \nage frequency sweep. Preliminary measurements that \ndemonstrate the response of three-wavelength (1 .O, 2.5, \nand 5.0 mm) sensor to the molecular diffusion process \nwere presented in [ 11. Similar tests using interdigital \nsensor have been done by other investigators to measure \nmoisture diffusion in thin epoxy films 121. \nA companion paper [3] describes the details of the sen- \nsor design and measurement setup. It uses the output of \nthree wavelengths at 70°C to find the moisture spatial \nprofiles and then simulates the diffusio'n process using \na constant moisture diffusion coefficient model until the \nnumerical model reasonably matches the experimental \nprofile. In this paper, a linear relation between the tran- \nscapacitance and the moisture concentration is also as- \nsumed, and the output of the shortest wavelength of 1 \nmm at different temperatures is used to find the diffusion \ncoefficient as a function of concentration and tempera- \nture. The shortest wavelength provides t.he most accurate \nvalues of moisture concentration because the. moisture \ndistribution near the zero flux boundary is essentially \nconstant within its relatively small penetration depth. \nExperiment \nThe interdigital sensor is attached to one side of the \npressboard, whereas the other side of the pressboard is \nexposed to ambient conditions through a perforated steel \nplate. The four side edges of the pressboard sample are \nsealed with silicon glue to only allow one dimensional \ndiffusion transverse to the pressboard surface. The test \nsandwich structure is placed in a vacuum-tight chamber \nwhose temperature and moisture can be monitored and \ncontrolled [ 11. \nThe tests were performed at five temperatures: 30, 40, \nSO, 60, and 70°C. Hi-Val pressboard, manufactured by \nERV-Weidmann Industries, Inc., is used in all experi- \nments. The samples are 1.5 mm thick except for rnea- \nsurements at 30°C where the pressboard thickness is \n1.0 mm. The reason for this exception is that the diffu- \nsion process is very long at low temperatures due to a \nsmall diffusion coefficient. The reduction of thickness \nfrom 1.5 mm to 1.0 mm shortens the di€fusion time by \napproximately 56%. At each constant temperature, the \npressboard was first vacuum-dried for over 24 hours. \nThis gives a uniform zero initial moisture distribution. \nThe moisture diffusion process starts by bubbling a Icon- \nstant flow of moist air. \nThis paper analyzes the signals from the sensing elec- \ntrodes taken at 1 Hz sinusoidal frequency. The 1 mm \nwavelength sensor measures the transimpedance of the \nregion close to the sensor-pressboard interface. The \nmoisture concentration at the sensor-pressboard inteiface \nat any time during the diffusion process is measured us- \ning a linear relationship between the transcapacitance \nand the moisture concentration. \nBoundary Condition \nThe measurement schematic is shown in Figure 1. The \nmoist air flow keeps the relative humidity of the testing \nchamber at a nearly constant level, which gives a con- \nstant moisture boundary condition at the pressboard-air \ninterface at 2 = 1. The other side of the pressboard is \nagainst the sensor at x = 0, which imposes a zero flux \nboundary condition. \n0-7803-5035-9/98/$10.0001998 IEEE. \nTable 1: Polynomial fitting parameters for partition curves for ambient air relative humidity and moisture in paper \nfor various temperatures. \nI I \nx=o x=l \nFigure 1: 1 mm wavelength sensor detects changes at the \npressboard-sensor surface at x = 0 while the moisture \ndiffuses from the ambient at z = I. \nThe air relative humidity is monitored by a commercial \nrelative humidity sensor and the value is converted to \nthe moisture in pressboard at the boundary using air- \npressboard equilibrium curves drawn by Oommen [4] \nfrom Jeffries’ data [5].

The moisture equi- \nlibrium curves reconstructed from the 6-th order poly- \nnomial are shown in Figure 2. \nDiffusion Analysis \nOur goal is to find the diffusion coefficient D and the \nmoisture spatial profiles during the entire diffusion pro- \ncess. The diffusion of moisture is defined mathemati- \ncally in one dimension by Fick’s second law of diffusion: \nWhen D is a constant, closed form solution for zero \ninitial distribution and constant boundary condition C1 \nat x = 1 and zero flux at x = 0 is \n12 \nL. \n$10- \na \nO6 20 40 60 80 - 100 \n% Relative Humidity \nFigure 2 Moisture in wood pulp as a function of ambi- \nent relative humidity curves reconstructed from the 6-th \norder polynomial fit to Jeffries’[S] data. \nwhere \nWhen the diffusion coefficient is concentration- \ndependent, equation (2) becomes non-linear and no gen- \neral analytical solution is available. Numerical methods \nare then employed to solve the diffusion equation. \nIn 1974 Guidi and Fullerton in their paper 161 gave an \nempirical fit for diffusion coefficients of oil-impregnated \nKraft paper from data studied by Ewart: \nD(C, T) = DOekC+Eo(l/TO-l/T) (5) \nwhere DO = 6.44 x m2/s , k = 0.5, C is the \nmoisture concentration in weight percent per unit weight \ndry cellulose, E, = 7700”K, and T is the absolute \nKelvin temperature. They didn’t specify TO; however, \nfrom Foss’s work in 1987 171, it appears that TO = \n298°K. \nFoss [7] generalized the empirical work at General Elec- \ntric and fitted the diffusion coefficient for both oil-free \nand oil-impregnated paper into the same form as Guidi \nand Fullerton in (5) with To = 298°K and k = 0.5. \nThe corresponding parameters are shown in Table 2. \n342 \nTable 2: Diffusion coefficient parameters estimated by \nFoss [7]. \n1 0.67 x lo-’’ m2/s 1 0.45 I 76lml \nTable 3: Diffusion coefficient parameters obtained from \nmeasurements using a least square fit. \nThe same temperature and moisture concentration de- \npendence model of (5) is used here to find ithe corrc- \nsponding parameters, DO, k, and Ea, for Hi-’Val press- \nboard from our experiments. \n__. \nDO k E, \n-. \nLet \ndz = D(C)dC, (6) \nthen (2) becomes \n(7) \nEquation (7) is discretized for numerical calculation \nCn+l -- c3” z;;; - 2x;+l -t z3--1 nt L \n3 (8) -- - - \nAt (AX)2 \nwhere superscript n corresponds to time steps, and sub- \nscript J corresponds to space steps. This backward time \nscheme is chosen for stability of the algorithm [8]. \nStandard numerical procedures are then carried out to \nsolve (8). \nTo find the parameters for the diffusiori coefficient, the \nmeasured moisture concentration by the 1 mm wave- \nlength sensor is taken at five different temperatures and \nthe Matlab built-in function for least square fit leastsq \nin the optimization toolbox is used to find the paramc- \nters that minimize the sum of the errclr squxes of the \nmoisture concentration. The results are shown in Table \n3, \nDiscussion \nFor T = 70°C, the diffusion Coefficient at the start when \nC = 0% is 1.9 x 1 OP1’ m2/s, and at the end ,when C = \nt=3Q h \n- - Dasconstant \nt=2 h \n0 0.5 1 \nPressboard thickness, mm \nFigure 3: Calculated moisture profile in the pressboard \nat 60°C for diffusion coefficient as a function of con- \ncentration using estimated parameters and as a constant \nD = 2.4 x lo-’’ m2/s, an average of D at C = 0% \nand C = 3.0010. \n1.8% is 4.3 x m2/s. The average is about 3.1 x \nlo-” m2/s. This is close to the value that is estimated \nin [3] for a constant diffusion coefficient model, 2.3 x \nlo-’’ m2/s . In this paper, the diffusion coefficient \nis found by minimizing the sum of the error squares \nbetween the measured moisture concentration and the \ntheoretical values for various temperatures. whereas the \napproach in [3] uses a constant diffusion coefficient to \ndo forward simulation until the calculated profile closely \nmatches most of the measured profile. \nThe spatial profiles of the diffusion process at 60°C with \nthe di€fusion coefficient as a function of concentration, \nand as a constant D = 2.4 x m2/s (an average \nof D at C = 0% and C = 3.0%) are shown in Figure \n3. The curves are plotted from 2 hours to 30 hours at \n2-hour intervals. At first, since the moisture concentra- \ntion is low, the diffusion coefficient in most regions is \nsmaller than the average value, the curves for constant \ndiffusion coefficient increase faster than the concentra- \ntion dependent model. When the moisture in the press- \nboard increases, the diffusion speed also increases, thus \nthe concentration dependent curves exceed the constant \ndiffusion curves. This also explains why the experi- \nmental data in Figure 5 of [3] shows that the moisture \nreaches equilibrium in a time of 28 hours, whereas the \nconstant diffusion coefficient simulation in Figure 6 of \n[3] has not yet reached equilibrium after 28 hours. \nThe diffusion coefficient for oil-free pressboard calcu- \nlated here is much smaller than that reported in 171. \nThis could be due to three reasons. First, the materials \nare different.

The reported value in [9] by Quarshie is close to \nour results given in Table 4. Quarshie used 50 layers of \nManilla paper each 0.045 mm thick. \nSecond, our sample is tightly compressed. Pressure has \nbeen shown to slow down the diffusion process [9]. \nFor the EHV Weidmann T-IV pressboard that Quarshie \ntested, the diffusion coefficient of unclamped pressboard \nis about 1.3 times that of clamped pressboard. \nThird, due to the porous squeezing structure at the \npressboard-air interface, the pressboard is not completely \nexposed to the ambient at that interface. This might \nslow down the diffusion, but the effect should be small \nbecause the diffusion in the direction parallel to the in- \nterface is much faster than that of the direction perpen- \ndicular to the interface which we are studying. \nConclusions \nThe diffusion process in oil-free pressboard is monitored \nat five different temperatures using interdigital dielec- \ntrometry sensor technology. An algorithm is developed \nfor finding the diffusion coefficient as a function of \nmoisture concentration and temperature. \nFuture experiments will combine a transformer oil con- \nvective flow facility and the interdigital sensor setup \nfor studying temperature and moisture transients in oil- \nimpregnated pressboard. That facility will minimize the \nsecond and third effects discussed above. Other insulat- \ning materials would be tested and compared with litera- \nture values. \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the fi- \nnancial support of the Electric Power Research Institute. \nunder grant WO 8619-01, managed by Mr. S.
