  "abstract": "The Maximum entropy (ME) approach has been extensively used for various natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, text segmentation and text classification. Previous work in text classification has been done using maximum entropy modeling with binary-valued features or counts of feature words. In this work, we present a method to apply Maximum Entropy modeling for text classification in a different way it has been used so far, using weights for both to select the features of the model and to emphasize the importance of each one of them in the classification task. Using the X square test to assess the contribution of each candidate feature from the obtained X square values we rank the features and the most prevalent of them, those which are ranked with the higher X square scores, they are used as the selected features of the model. Instead of using Maximum Entropy modeling in the classical way, we use the X square values to weight the features of the model and give thus a different importance to each one of them. The method has been evaluated on Reuters-21578 dataset for test classification tasks, giving very promising results and performing comparable to some of the “state of the art” systems in the classification field.",
