The WHO\nestimates that about three million people who developed TB in\n2012 were missed by the national notification systems [1]. Experts\nin the field emphasize that a successful international and national\nTB control program ought to be hinged on accurate diagnosis of\nactive TB cases [2,3]. Although case detection in developing\ncountries likes Uganda has increased over the years, some resource\nlimited settings like Mubende have continued to register poor case\ndetection levels [4]. There are various TB diagnostic tools\navailable [5], however, there is a universal recognition of\nlimitations with the commonly used tools.\nDirect smear microscopy (DZM) which uses Ziehl-Neelsen as\nthe acid-fast dye is the most commonly used of the WHO\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e100720\n\nrecommended diagnostic tool for tuberculosis in low and middle-\nincome countries [3,6]. This is mainly because it is cheap, easy to\noperate and rapid [6]. However, the test has a low sensitivity, with\na detection limit of between 5,000–10,000 bacilli/ml of sample [7–\n9]. For patients with a low bacillary load, as seen in HIV patients\nand infants, true positive cases can easily be missed [10–12]. It has\nbeen suggested that the low sensitivity of DZM could partly be due\nto the fact that facilities in high incidence areas where the test is\nused as a sole diagnostic tool are usually resource limited, and thus\nleading to high workload on personnel [10–12]. Over the years\nthere have been better diagnostic techniques, however their\nadaptation to resource poor settings remains a challenge. For\nexample the low sensitivity of DZM can be improved by sputum\nconcentration and/or use of direct fluorescence microscopy\n(DFM) which uses auramines as the acid-fast dye [13,14]. This\ntest has an added advantage of requiring only one or two sputum\nspecimens rather than three to reach an acceptable level of\nperformance, which in effect reduces the diagnostic time [13,14].\nSeveral studies documenting the diagnostic gain of DFM have\nrecommended its implementation [5,13]. Unfortunately, most of\nthese studies have been performed at validation stages and only a\nfew have documented its performance in routine practice. It is\ntherefore important to document the performance of DFM\ncompared to DZM in a resource limited clinical setting so as to\ninform policy makers on proper implementation of TB diagnostics\n[14].\nCulture of mycobacteria on solid media has been considered the\ngold standard for tuberculosis diagnosis. The minimum detection\nlimit of 10 mycobacteria/ml significantly surpasses the minimum\ndetection limit given by DZM [15]. Unfortunately, the growth of\nTB bacilli requires a protracted period of 4–8 weeks, delaying\nappropriate treatment in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis.\nThe Mycobacteria growth indicator tubes (MGIT) on the other\nhand is a fully automated, non-invasive system for recovery of\nmycobacteria in liquid culture medium but has a draw-back of\nbeing expensive [16]. Previous laboratory studies have shown a\nhigher and faster recovery of mycobacteria from sputum\nspecimens than culture on solid medium [17,18] but the crucial\ndiagnostic value is better harnessed if deployed in large diagnostic\nfacilities. This is because of the infrastructure, high skill and\nmaintenance requirements all of which are scarce in rural settings.\nIt is noteworthy that, under and over diagnosis contributes to\nfurther spread of the disease and wastage of scarce resources on\ninappropriate treatment respectively. It is therefore crucial to find\na cost effective sequences and/or combination of these tools to\nstrike a balance between these two attributes. The use of an\nalgorithm/screening-sequence that combines both the clinical\npicture and diagnostic tools could guide physicians in establishing\nthis balance. There have been multitudes of conflicting evaluation\nreports on the efficiency of the 2007 WHO diagnostic algorithms\nfor TB diagnosis in different settings [8,19–21].\nTherefore it is critical to continuously refine diagnostic protocols\nin resource-limited settings. This will not only improve case\ndetection, but also identify areas within the diagnostic chain that\nare most likely to lead to over and under diagnosis (misdiagnosis).\nTherefore the aim of this study was to compare diagnostic tools\nused at the Mubende regional referral hospital with an extra set of\ntools used during a research study period in order to:\na) Assess the performance of direct Z&N microscopy (DZM) in\ndetecting TB cases from clinical specimens.\nb) Estimate the utility of three TB-associated predictors in an\nalgorithm with and without DZM.\nTo achieve these, results from direct smear microscopic\nexamination of sputum, lymph node and abscess aspirates at\nMubende regional referral hospital were compared to results from\nduplicates analysed using fluorescent microscopy (DZM), culture\non LJ media and MGIT at the Mycobacteriology Laboratory,\nDepartment of Medical Microbiology, Makerere University\n[22,23]. Only TB cases caused by bacteria in theMycobacterium\ntuberculosis Complex (MTC) were considered in this analysis\n[22,23]. It should also be noted that DZM is the only diagnostic\ntool used at Mubende regional referral hospital. Although the\nhospital has radiology facilities, these are mainly used for\northopaedic purposes.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthical considerations\nFull ethical clearance (ref: HS 879) was obtained from the\nUganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST).\nPrior to this study, healthcare authorities and the research team\nwere briefed about the ethical issues. Due to logistical and facility\nsetup, oral consent was obtained from participating patients\n(documented on the information sheets), something that was in\nline with the research ethical mandate given by UNCST.\nFurthermore, data were anonymised before analyses as stipulated\nby the UNCST guidelines of research involving human as research\nparticipants (2.2/b-e/2007).\nStudy site\nMubende district is located in the central region of Uganda,\ninhabited by approximately 750,000 people of whom an estimated\n64% live below the poverty line in population dense urban and\nperi-urban areas [24]. Piot’s model on TB treatment and health\nseeking suggests that only 20% of examined individuals seeking\ncare at a health facility will be diagnosed [25]. In this regard,\naccording to socio- anthropological studies on mycobacterial\ninfections in the Uganda [26], it is estimated that only 35% of the\nUgandan population, especially in the Uganda cattle corridor\n(where Mubende districts is located), seeks health care from\nallopathic practitioners [26]. This status quo would suggests that\nonly a fraction of TB cases make it to hospitals which probably\nexplains the low TB case detection level of 37% in Mubende\ndistrict [4].\nStudy design and population\nThis study was part of a wider study of the molecular\nepidemiology of TB in Mubende district of Uganda conducted\nby the same authors and described elsewhere [22,23]. Briefly, data\nwas obtained from a cross sectional study conducted between\nFebruary and July 2011. The participating patients had to have\npresented with cervical lymphadenitis/abscesses and/or a cough\nthat had persisted for at least two weeks at Mubende regional\nreferral hospital. The national tuberculosis program (NTP) is only\nrun at this referral hospital in the Mubende district and all\npersistent ailments are treated here. This implies that the majority\nof residents in this district who met the study’s criteria would most\nlikely be treated at this facility.\nSample collection\nSputum and/or lymph node aspirates were collected using\nstandard procedures as described by Muwongeet al. [23]. One\nappropriate sample was collected from patients that had either a\ncough or lymphadenitis/abscess, or both from patients that had\nboth clinical presentations. A total of 344 samples from 344\npatients were taken in duplicates. One of the duplicates was\nScreening Algorithm for Tuberculosis in Resource Limited Settings\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e100720\ndelivered to the diagnostic laboratory within Mubende regional\nreferral hospital for DZM and the other was delivered to the bio-\nsafety level 3 (BSL3) Mycobacteriology Laboratory, Department of\nMedical Microbiology, Makerere University. Here direct fluores-\ncent microscopy (DFM), culture and drug resistance tests (DST)\nwere carried out (Figure 1). A questionnaire was also administered\nto each patient to retrieve information about the patients’ socio-\neconomic welfare, as an addition to the clinical information (Table\nS1).\nDiagnostic Tools\nDirect Ziehl-Neelsen smear microscopy (DZM). At\nMubende regional referral hospital, direct smears from each\nsample were examined with the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method\n(Figure 1). A sample smear prepared on slide, air-dried and heat\nfixed. It was flooded with 1% carbol fuchsin and heated (steaming\nNOT boiling) for five minutes. This was then washed with water\nand decolorized using 3% acid-alcohol followed by a brief wash\nwith water. It was then stained with 0.3% methylene blue for 30–\n60 seconds and then washed with water and air-dried. This slide\nwas then visualized under a light microscope (Olympus CX31)\nusing a 10\n3 magnification. A positive sample was defined as one\nthat showed acid-fast rods in a 300 fields of the slide as\nrecommended by WHO [27–29].\nDirect fluorescent smear microscopy (DFM). Smears\nwere made from the duplicate samples and stained for fluorescent\nmicroscopy according to standard method [5,28]. The light source\nused was a Light Emitting Diode (LED) (Fraen Corporation Srl,\nVia delle Querce, Trivolzio(Pv) Italy). Thereafter the bacillary load\nwas established. Bacillary load is a measure of culture forming\nunits as seen with the aid of staining dye and is used to quantify the\nnumber of bacilli in a sample [27–29]. If a sample contains 10–99\nFigure 1.

Culture contam-\nination was considered if a DZM AFB negative sample grew on\nblood agar (Table S2).\nDrug susceptibility profile. The drug susceptibility profiles\nwere obtained from previously published data by the same author\nfor the relevant patients [22,23]. The susceptibility to four drugs\nused as first line therapy namely; Streptomycine, Rifampicine,\nIsoniazid and Ethambutol of DZM false negative cases were\nidentified and used for the public health component of this study.\nData management and analysis\nInformation obtained from the questionnaires, HIV status from\nindividual health record and corresponding TB results for each\npatient were entered in Excel 2007. The data were then exported\nto Stata (Stata ver. 11/SE for Windows, Stata Corp, College\nstation) and R software version 2.15.3 (http://cran.r-project.org/)\nfor appropriate statistical analyses.\nEstimation of diagnostic test characteristics and\nagreement. Assessment of diagnostic characteristic was done\nusing the diagt command in Stata (Stata ver. 11/SE for windows,\nStata Corp, College station) considering DZM and DFM as the\ntests to be evaluated and culture on LJ media as the reference test\n(gold standard). The kappa measure of agreement between\ndiagnostic tests was also calculated.\nSurvival analysis of time to detection of bacilli on\nMGIT960. Survival analysis was done using thesurvival package\nin the R software environment, the same excel data set was\nconverted into a CSV file and imported into R for the survival\nanalysis. The time (T = 19 days) denotes the maximum time to\ndetection in this study, but the total time of observation was 6\nweeks (42 days). Using theSurv function within the survival analysis\npackage an event was defined as becoming positive and time to\ndetection measured in days. Note that the censor time is set at\nT = 19.

A Cox proportion\nhazard model was built from explanatory factors that showed\nsignificant variation in time to detection and fulfilled the model\nassumptions. The post model evaluation was done using standard\nprocedures.\nDiagnostic/screening algorithm. The diagnostic/screen-\ning algorithm in this study is a layout of a logistic regression model\nthat contains some of the WHO recommended predictors [3,28].\nThe analysis in this study explored the model (algorithm) case\nprediction in each of the sub-populations formed by the different\ncombinations of clinical and diagnostic aspects so as to give an\nestimate of the likely-hood of case detection. In order to estimate\nthe utility (predictive ability) of this diagnostic algorithm, features\nof the clinical history and DZM results were used as predictors of\ntrue disease status (culture on LJ results) in a multivariable logistic\nregression model. The model was built in a forward step-by-step\napproach that resembles the events leading to a physician\nrequesting for DZM test in Mubende referral hospital. At each\nstep the proportions of true cases and predicted cases (Probability\nof being a case) are calculated and presented in an algorithm tree/\nchart.

In order to\nmaximize the number of true cases classified when DZM is used in\nthis algorithm, a receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC)\nanalysis was done to identify the lowest probability cut-off with the\nhighest sensitivity and specificity. The final model validation and\npost estimation analysis were done using the standard statistical\nmethods in Stata.\nResults\n344 individuals were examined, 206 (60%) were male and 138\n(40%) were female, with an average age of 31.5 (18.5–44.3) years,\nheight of 155.7 (153.8–157.4) cm and weight of 50.4 (49.2–51.55)\nkg. Forty-seven percent of the patients were married and 41%\nsingle, the rest widowed, divorced or too young to be categorized.\nSummary of DZM, DFM and culture results\nThe descriptive results of DZM, DFM and culture are given in\nTable 1. Acid-fast bodies (AFB) were identified 32 (9.3%) samples\nfrom 344 patients examined by DZM at the Mubende regional\nreferral hospital. Samples from 61 patients (18%) had AFB on\nDFM, and growth on LJ media detected 66 cases (19%) (Table 1).\nMost of the cases detected by DZM had a bacillary load of+3.\nOf the DZM positive patients, 19 (59.3%) and 13 (40.6%) were\nmale and female respectively. The same trend is reflected\nthroughout the test on the rest of the diagnostic tools. A majority\nof the DZM positive samples were recovered from HIV infected\nmiddle-aged patients. A prospective follow-up of the specimen\nanalysis from DZM through DFM and then culture showed a\nsteady increase in the number of positive cases detected (Table 1).\nIt is noteworthy that the culture contamination proportion was 6/\n344 or approximately 2% of the cultured samples showed culture\ncontamination (Table S2).\nDiagnostic features and comparison of tests\nDZM was able to detect 36.4% of the true TB cases in this\nstudy. This test had a sensitivity and specificity of 36.4% (95%\nCI = 24.9–49.1) and 97.1% (95% CI = 94.4–98.7) when compared\nto the gold standard respectively.

The low sensitivity of DZM was also\nreflected in the low kappa agreement measure against the gold\nstandard. It is noteworthy that there was no significant difference\nin false positives recovered when DZM was compared to the gold\nstandard (Table 2).\nDFM detected 53 of the 66 cases detected by the gold standard\nand therefore had a sensitivity and a specificity of 80.3% (95%\nCI = 68.7–89.1) and 97.1% (95% CI = 94.4–98.7) respectively.\nFigure 2.

Consequently, DFM produced a higher positive\nand negative predictive value than DZM (Table 2). It should be\nnoted that although MGIT 960 recovered more positive cases\n(n = 69) than culture on LJ media (n = 66) (Table S2), given that\nthese two agreed on 60 cases, the latter was considered as the gold\nstandard for this study.\nDZM-false negative cases\nA significant proportion of HIV positive cases gave false\nnegative results on DZM. In fact the odds of false negative results\namong HIV positive patients were six times those of HIV negative\npatients (Table 3). Smoking also appears to be associated with false\nnegative result, this is because the odds of false negative DZM\nresults among smokers were twice those of non-smokers. Similarly,\nsample type (clinical presentation) was also associated with false\nnegative results i.e. the odds of an abscess aspirate giving a false\nnegative results was almost six times that of a sputum sample\n(Table 3). The drug susceptibility profiles of DZM false negative\ncases showed that eight cases were resistant to at least one drug\nused in the first line treatment against TB in Mubende district\n(Table 4). Of these one was resistant to both Rifampicin and\nIsoniazid, hence classified as multidrug resistant (MDR).\nEvaluation of time to detection on MGIT960\nThe time to detection, (TTD) of bacilli on MGIT 960 is\npresented in Figure 2 and the hazard ratios are given in table 5. In\ngeneral, the majority of patients’ time to detections was 2–4 days,\nbut the maximum time to detection was 19 days. From the\nKaplan-Meier plots the time to detection on MGIT960 appears to\nbe a function of bacillary load in a specimen (Figure 2). The Cox\nproportional hazard model shows that the hazard of becoming a\nFigure 3.

This clinical facet alone contained 38, 18 and 9 true TB\ncases proportion-wise respectively. However if this were to be used\nalone as predictor in this algorithm (Model), the model would not\nbe able to classify any cases regardless of the high AUC (Figure 3).\n(The author has chosen to follow HIV positive smokers for the\npurposes of explaining). When this clinical picture was combined\nwith the patient’s tobacco smoking status, the number of true TB\ncases among smokers was 19, 8 and 6 respectively. At this step the\nmodel would be able to accurately classify 6 of the 66 true cases\nwith AUC = 0.66. If the HIV status of these patients was then\nadded to the model, the total number true cases among HIV\npositive smokers were 11, 5, and 3 respectively. At this step the\nmodel could accurately classify 22 of the 66 true cases. At this\npoint if the physician asked the patient to take a DZM test, the\nnumber of true cases among DZM positive, HIV positive smokers\nwas 5, 3 and 1 respectively. At this point the model could\naccurately classify 33 of the 66 true cases with AUC = 0.88. The\noptimized probability cut-off with the highest sensitivity and\nspecificity is present in (Figure 4). After adjusting the cut-off\nprobability the model with the same AUC = 0.88 could classify 52\nof the 66 true TB cases (Table 6 and Figure 3). This however\nincreased the number of false positive cases up to 50. The\npathways that are most likely to bring in false positive cases are\nhighlighted as broken lines (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nDirect smear microscopy (DZM) is the principal method of TB\ndiagnosis in resource-limited settings like Mubende district,\nUganda [3,6,32]. This is because it is a cheap procedure that\ncan deliver results in less than a day [32]. There is a common\nagreement on the limitation of this test, some of which include a\nlow sensitivity, especially on specimens with a low bacillary load\n[7,8,13]. The findings in this study are in agreement with these\nprevious reported on DZM characteristics. For example the\nfindings show that the greatest proportion of high bacillary load\nsamples (+3) were identified on DZM. This means that of those\nthat sought health care under the set criterion, DZM would most\nlikely pick up the highly symptomatic active TB patients [21]. On\nthe other hand, although not statistically significant, more of the\nlow bacillary load samples (+1 and+2) were recovered by tools not\nused at this facility (DFM and culture).\nOne of the positive attributes of DZM is that it has a high\nspecificity, and in this study a specificity of 97.1% was observed.\nTherefore it adequately classifies true negative cases, leaving little\nroom for wastage of scarce resources on inappropriate treatment\n[32]. This limited frequency of false-positive results by DZM\nnormally outweighs the advantages of high detection rates in\nmycobacterial culture considering the importance of timely\ndiagnosis with regards to TB in resource-limited settings [5]\n[27]. This would not necessarily be the case for DFM [5]. On the\nother hand, the low kappa agreement between DZM and culture\non LJ media highlights the significantly high possibility of missing\nFigure 4. The receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) showing the lowest cut-off probability with the highest specificity and\nsensitivity for the diagnostic/screening algorithm, this probability is used to adjust the case classification in figure 2.The Solid line\nrepresents DZM on its own at AUC =,66%, the dotted line shows the model with DZM and the three predictors at AUC =, 88%.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0100720.g004\nScreening Algorithm for Tuberculosis in Resource Limited Settings\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e100720\nof TB cases thus a low sensitivity. In this regard, DZM alone was\nable to correctly classify only 24 of the 66 true cases, so in the\nabsence of a rigorous screening procedure nearly two thirds of the\ncases had a possibility of being missed. Studies have in the recent\npast documented the phenomenon of smear-negative TB cases\n[10,13,19,33] especially among HIV infected patients. This\nphenomenon was also explored in this study using a logistic\nregression model to determine associated factors. The findings\nreveal that an HIV positive patient was more likely to give a false\nnegative result on DZM than an HIV negative patient. The\nfinding supports Corbett’s conclusion that HIV was largely\nassociated with the increased burden of undiagnosed TB in\nZimbabwe [21]. This status quo would be counterproductive to\nthe current tuberculosis control program in Uganda, as it\ncontributes to further spread of the disease [32]. The sample\ntype, which was a proxy for either the patient’s pulmonary or\nextra-pulmonary tuberculosis status was also associated with DZM\nfalse negative results. In other words, a sample from the extra-\npulmonary compartment specifically from an abscess was more\nlikely to produce a false negative result on DZM. Although the\ndirect link between extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and false\nnegative results is not well documented, studies have shown that\nthese two phenomena are associated with HIV infection [34,35]. It\nshould however be note that the observed association in this study\nis based on a small proportion of patients with abscesses, so a\nlarger number is needed to validate the association. Smokers were\non the other hand more likely to give DZM false negative result\nthan non-smokers. Although this finding is in agreement with\nprevious studies [36], other reports have documented it as delayed\nAFB conversion within smokers [37]. Analysis of drug suscepti-\nbility profiles of the DZM false negative cases shows that some of\nthese were infected withM. tuberculosis bacilli which were resistant\nto at least one of the four drugs used as first line treatment for\ntuberculosis, one of them was categorized as case multi drug\nresistant (MDR) tuberculosis. This finding has public health\nimplications, because among the would-be under-diagnosed group\nwas an individual who had the potential of spreading MDR-TB to\nthe public.\nThe comparison of DFM with the gold standard reveals that it\nhas much better diagnostic characteristics than DZM, with an\nover 50% increment in case detection. This is in agreement with\nreports in Kenya [38] and India [39], although the later\ndocumented a 26% increment. On the other hand Toman’s\n[27] only reported a slight difference in sensitivity between the two\nmethods but his conclusions on false positive cases between the\ntwo tools is in agreement with the current study. The higher\nagreement of DFM and culture on LJ media also means that more\npatients could get results and start treatment much faster if DFM\nhad been used in this setting. Therefore although it would require\nfinancial and skills input, an upgrade from DZM to DFM would\nsignificantly improve the case detection especially of smear\nnegative HIV positive TB cases at Mubende regional referral\nhospital. This has also been recommended elsewhere [10,13,38].\nIn reality, this diagnostic test was only carried out on a duplicate\nsample transported to the Mycobacteriology Laboratory, Depart-\nment of Medical Microbiology, Makerere University located in\nUganda’s capital city. Although DFM has been rolled out in some\nreferral hospitals in last one year, in general it is still not widely\nused in health facilities in rural areas. The greatest challenge to\nusing DFM in resource poor settings is the fact that such areas are\nunderfunded, with over-worked personnel who receive a huge bulk\nof diagnostic specimens every day [11,12]. Therefore, unless this is\naddressed, the diagnostic benefits of DFM could be missed if and\nTable 6.The logistic regression model shows the diagnostic utility of using DZM within the screening algorithm in (Figure 2).\nVariable Levels With-out DZM With DZM\nOdd ratio (95% CI) P-value Cases classified Odd ratio (95% CI) P-value Cases classified\nSample type Sputum 1 22/66 1 33/66\nLymph node aspirates 0.6(0.3–1.2) 0.154 0.4(0.2–0.9) 0.038\nAbscess aspirates 4.4(1.4–14.0) 0.012 5.5(1.7–18.0) 0.004\nSmoking No 1 1\nYes 2.5(1.3–4.9) 0.004 2.2(1.1–4.5) 0.027\nHIV status Negative 1 1\nPositive 5.4(2.3–12.5) ,0.01 5.8(2.3–14.9) 0.000\nUnknown 0.3(0.12–0.7) 0.01 0.4(0.15–1.11) 0.081\nDZM test Negative – – 1\nPositive – – 16.6(5.8–47.1) ,0.001 *52/66\nArea under ROC curve (AUC) = 0.843without DZM, 0.886 with DZM * Case classification with adjusted cut –off probability = 0.19 at (Sensitivity = 0.81, Specificity = 0.80).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0100720.t006\nScreening Algorithm for Tuberculosis in Resource Limited Settings\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e100720\nwhen rolled out because the quality of the smear declines with time\n[27].\nIt would be idealistic to expect that all resource-limited settings\nare able to roll out programmes to use DFM in all diagnostic\ncentres given the extra cost associated with it. For those facilities\nthat would not immediately adopt it, the utility of a diagnostic\nalgorithm/screening procedure with and without DZM in it was\nexplored in this study.\nWHO recommends several diagnostic algorithms for different\ncase scenarios, however, the 2006/7 international standards for\ntuberculosis care is the most used [28]. The use of the clinical\nhistory like HIV status and symptoms can greatly increase the\nprobability of detecting TB cases [40], although cases are bound to\nbe missed if these are used in isolation [21]. The findings\ndemonstrate that if the clinical presentation of; either cough,\nlymphadenitis or abscess alone was used to predict TB status, no\ncases would be accurately classified in this algorithm. However, a\ncough persistent for at least two weeks on its own has been\nreported to have a sensitivity of 55% among people living with\nHIV [8]. On the other hand in Ethiopia, it has been documented\nthat if this type of cough were considered alone one could miss up\nto 56% of the cases [41]. In the current study when the first clinical\npresentation was combined with the patients tobacco smoking\nstatus the algorithm could accurately classify six TB cases, in effect\nsix cases identified by this model are attributable to knowing the\npatients smoking status. Access to the patient’s HIV status\naccurately classifies another sixteen cases. To put this in context\nat this point the screening algorithm could accurately classify two\ncases less of what DZM could when used on its own. The TB\ndiagnostic utility of the HIV status has been reported in the recent\npast [8,21,29,42] and although there is a common recognition that\nHIV screening of all suspected TB cases would greatly improve\ncase detection, it can only be adopted when simple and cheap HIV\ndiagnostics are available in these settings [1,21]. Adding the DZM\nresults to this screening algorithm would accurately classify 33 of\nthe 66 true TB cases, that is to say the model gives DZM a 13.6%\n(9/66) increment in case classification. The number of true cases\nclassified was maximized to 52/66 (42% increment in case\nclassification) by taking a specificity trade-off that inherently comes\nwith DZM. Although this adjusted screening algorithm would\nimprove case classification, the choice of such a screening\nalgorithm over adopting DFM would come with a problem of\nover-diagnosing. This optimisation produced up to 50 false\npositive cases. According to estimates produced [43] on TB\ncontrol in rural Uganda, if such a choice was taken in Mubende\ndistrict, it could have potentially cost the control programme up to\n(506351 =\n£17,550) in inappropriate TB management during the\nstudy period. However, the screening chart highlights the\npathways that are most likely to produce these false positive cases.\nIt is noteworthy that although the same analysis was not done with\nDFM as the test of choice, its diagnostics characteristics in this\nalgorithm can be inferred from the current analysis. For example:\nFrom this analysis the gold standard gives a point of reference with\nregards to disease status (n = 66), therefore the three clinical\npredictors together with DZM give us a measure of how close we\ncan get to detecting these 66 cases. With this in mind, if DFM\nalone detects 53 of the 66 cases and DZM and DFM have the\nsame false positive rate, it was inferred that DFM would detect\nsignificantly more cases when used with the three predictors. The\nadjusted cut-off probability would however be different in this\ncase. The clinical implication of this is that it is possible to arrive at\nan accurate diagnosis of TB with this screening algorithm using a\nsingle sample hence early treatment commencement.\nEstablishing bacillary load is a crucial but laborious process,\nwhich in some cases could result in ocular complications in over-\nworked laboratory technicians in high TB density areas [11,12].\nTherefore exploring diagnostic tool combinations that can reduce\nthe workload is also a crucial factor in the TB control strategy.\nAnalysis of MGIT 960 results reveals an association between time\nto detection and bacillary load of samples, in other words the\nhigher the bacillary load the shorter the time to detection. This is\nin concordance with previous reports [17]. The use of clinical\nfeatures as proxies for bacillary load shows that time to detection of\nbacilli was significantly associated to the following; HIV status,\ncigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. It might be possible to\ncombine the clinical picture and time to detection to make\ninferences about bacillary load, which then eliminates the extra\nwork put into microscopic bacillary quantification. Therefore if\nand when MGIT960 is introduced it is worthwhile exploring the\npossibility of using this technique so as to reduce the strain put on\nlaboratory technicians in establishing bacillary load.\nThe limitation to this study were; 1) the number of patients used\nwas lower than other studies that have compared diagnostics in\nresource limited settings. The sample size used however gave\nenough statistical power to detect differences. 2) a single sample per\npatient was used for the analysis. The WHO algorithms prescribe\nthe use of three samples of sputum in classifying certain disease\nstatus. However, given that this was a cross sectional research study,\nthe findings should be viewed as a cross sectional representation of\nthe dynamics in this areas, although can be a reflection of what is\nhappening in other resource limited settings with the same\ncharacteristics. Note that, all sputum sample collected were\ncollected at times prescribed by WHO. Therefore the interpreta-\ntions drawn from this work should take these issues in consideration.\nThe utility of a diagnostic test/tool/algorithm usually depends\non the disease incidence in the population, the sensitivity and\nspecificity of the test, tool and or algorithm, the physical risk and\nthe associated cost implications. In this regard clinical symptoms\nare not any different from diagnostic tests with the exception of\nsubjectivity. The challenge in clinical settings is establishing the\noptimum predictors (clinical questions) since the factors that\ngovern diagnostic tools vary in populations of different geograph-\nical locale. Therefore findings in this study suggest that availing\nresources for screening TB suspects for HIV might be the only\nlimiting factor in adopting such screening algorithms in resource\nlimited settings.\nConclusion\nThe study supports the concern that using DZM alone risks\nmissing majority of TB cases, in this case we found nearly 60%, of\nwho one was an MDR case. Although adopting DFM would\nreduce this proportion to 19%, the use of a three-predictor\nscreening algorithm together with DZM was almost as good as\nDFM alone. It’s utility is whoever subject to HIV screening all TB\nsuspects.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Questionnaire: The epidemiology of tubercu-\nlous and non-tuberculous mycobacteria in Mubende\ndistrict, Uganda.\n(PDF)\nTable S2 Database: A comparison of TB diagnostic\ntools used on samples from Mubende regional referral\nhospital.\n(XLSX)\nScreening Algorithm for Tuberculosis in Resource Limited Settings\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e100720\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to the participant who contributed to all of the\nstudies and the teams of investigators involved.
