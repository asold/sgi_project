  "abstract": "Aim: To evaluate the performance of the flagship models, OpenAI's GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in breast imaging cases. Material and Methods: The dataset consisted of cases from the publicly available Case of the Month archive by the Society of Breast Imaging. Questions were classified as text-based or containing images from mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, or hybrid imaging. The accuracy rates of GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Of the total 94 questions, 61.7% were image-based. The overall accuracy rate of GPT-4o was higher than that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (75.4% vs. 67.7%, p=0.432). GPT-4o achieved higher scores on questions based on ultrasound and hybrid imaging, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet performed better on mammography-based questions. In tumor group cases, both models reached higher accuracy rates compared to the non-tumor group (both, p&gt;0.05). The models' performance in breast imaging cases overall exceeded 75%, ranging between 64-83% for questions involving different imaging modalities. Conclusion: In breast imaging cases, although GPT-4o generally achieved higher accuracy rates than Claude 3.5 Sonnet in image-based and other types of questions, their performances were comparable.",
