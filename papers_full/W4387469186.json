  "abstract": "This paper argues for the inclusion of tools that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs) in information technology (IT) undergraduate courses that teach the fundamentals of software. LLM tools have become widely available and disrupt traditional methods for teaching software concepts. Learning objectives are compromised when students submit AI-generated code for a classroom assignment without comprehending or validating the code. Since LLM tools including OpenAI Codex, Copilot by GitHub, and ChatGPT are being used in industry for software development, students need to be familiar with their use without compromising student learning. Incorporating LLM tools into the curriculum prepares students for real-world software development. However, students still need to understand software fundamentals including how to write and debug code. There are many challenges associated with the inclusion of AI tools into the IT curriculum that need to be addressed and mitigated. This paper presents strategies and techniques to integrate student use of LLM tools, assist students' interaction with the tools, and help prepare students for careers that increasingly use AI tools to design, develop, and maintain software.",
