LLMs are machine-learning systems \nthat autonomously learn from data and can produce sophisticated and seemingly intelligent writing \nafter training on a massive data set of text (1). These models, like Google Bard, GPT-3.5 Turbo, \nand GPT-4.0 can be repurposed with minimal effort across numerous domains and diverse tasks \n(2). Natural language processing powered by pre -trained language models is the key technology \nfor medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems utilizing clinical narratives (3).     \nThere are numerous potential applications of LLMs in medicine: support in clinical decision -\nmaking, knowledge retrieval, summarizing the key diagnostic findings, triaging patients’ primary \ncare concerns, enhancing patients’ health literacy, and more (2). They have a high potential to \nmodernize academic research by accelerating data analysis, literature reviews , and referencing. \nThey can even participate in writing research papers, a controversy that is yet to be fully resolved \n(4,5). Clinical case reports written with the assistance of GPT have recently been published (6). \nIn a hospital environment, they have the potential to serve as a media for repetitive tasks, such as \nassistance with writing discharge letters by summarizing a patient’s hospital stay after reading \ntheir medical records or further recommendations (3,7). LLMs quickly analyze huge sets of data \nincluding electronic health records, or for example genomic data (8). This allows them to verify \npatterns not apparent to humans, identify potential risk factors, and even give predictions of the \noutcome (9). \nOn the other hand, while these models excel at producing linguistically accurate content, they lack \nthe capacity to understand or possess knowledge about the world in the same way humans do. This \nfundamental distinction necessitates an ongoing debate about the meaning fulness of AI and the \nrole of these models in clinical medicine. Clinical decision -making requires the synthesis of \nevidence-based medicine, guidelines, and sound clinical judgment (10). Not to be neglected is \nintuition, a process based on knowledge and care experience (11,12).  LLMs so far represented no \nmetacognition, an awareness of one’s own knowledge, and the ability to understand , control, and \ninfluence one’s cognitive processes, which might be the final step to true (artificial) intelligence  \n(13–15). LLMs, being trained and learning from massive datasets of text, can obviously learn much \nfaster and store much more information than any living human. However, having no ability of \nmetacognition, their process of learning is much less complex. LLMs can fall into the trap of \ndrawing information from uncertified sources, which can easily happen in an ever -evolving field \nof medicine. Therefore, LLMs can present accurate and misleading information with equal \nconfidence (14).   \nMentioned above are several reasons why these models are fa r from overtaking the role of \ndecision-making in medicine. However, they could present a more than welcoming helping tool \nthat has great potential to become fundamental for medical practice in the very near future, if used \n .

Further testing is needed before we start implementing LLMs in practice. The dynamic \nprogression of LLMs and the expanding number of different language models available request \nsubsequent comparative testing, or benchmarking (16). Overseeing this inevitable implementation \nof AI in everyday medical practice will give us much -needed control on knowledge sources and \napplication.  \nSeveral different tests questioning LLMs clinical relevance have been conducted recently. Most \nagree that LLMs can help with solving clinical cases, howeve r, care should be taken due to their \nimprecision, trouble with personalization, and overall misinformative behavior (17,18). \nSo far, the most acknowledged accomplishment of GPT was to score results at or near the passing \nthreshold for all three exams of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) (19). \nThe study tested GPT’s ability to perform clinical reasoning by testing its performance on \nstandardized, complex questions from the USMLE, which to an extent mimic clinical decision -\nmaking. GPT came close to or exceeded the passing threshold for all three steps of USMLE, \nproviding in-depth explanations and reasoning that show the potential for this AI to generate novel \ninsights that can assist human learners in medical education settings.   \nIn recent research (20) , GPT t ook the American Heart Association (AHA) Basic Life Support \n(BLS) and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) exams. A lthough it achieved results \nunder the passing threshold,  the answers provided were more relevant and in better compliance \nwith guidelines compared to other AI systems. It also gave explanations to support the answers to \nclinical-case questions. GPT revealed its value as a helping tool for providing references when \nlearning for clinical exams. However, care should be taken as it is not yet considered a completely \nreliable source of information.  \nAnother study examined GPT's accuracy in answering questions from the Ophthalmic Knowledge \nAssessment Program (OKAP) exam (21). The model achieved significant accuracy in two parallel \nexams, with variable performance across different subspecialties. The best results were scored in \ngeneral medicine and more modest ones in more narrow fields like neuro -ophthalmology or \nintraocular tumors. These results pointed out that more specific pre -training might be needed to \nimprove the LLM.   \nA form of AI has been in widespread use for some time in cardiology: electrocardiograms (ECG) \nare being interpreted by computers daily  (22). They might recognize patterns from the ECG \nbeyond human capability. This opens the potential to solve emerging problems in cardiology only \nusing ECG, making it a much more powerful diagnostic tool (23,24). A study from 2019 (25) has \nshown that machine lear ning ( ML) algorithms exceeded the diagnostic accuracy of a team of \npracticing cardiologists in the classification of 12 heart rhythm types from single -lead ECGs . \nExpert human ECG interpretation considering the clinical context cannot be omitted , however, \ncooperation with AI might improve efficiency and reduce the number of false interpretations. \n .

Clinical notes could be represented by a list of diseases and procedures, an ECG \nanalyzed by numbers that summarize the intervals, axis, and QRS morphology, and an ultrasound \nimage can be represented by the structures (26). Those formats could further be compared between \ninstitutions or combined to create a complete representation of a certain patient’s history  \ncontributing to the unification of health systems. \nML is already being used to improve upon traditional risk prediction algorithms using available \nregistry data. A study from 2020 demonstrated that ML integrating clinical parameters with \ncoronary artery calcium and  automated epicardial adipose tissue quantification significantly \nimproved the prediction of myocardial infarction and cardiac death compared with standard \nclinical risk assessment (23). A study from February 2023 (2 8) evaluated the appropriateness of \nChatGPT responses to questions regarding the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The \nquestions were designed to represent common dilemmas that any non-healthcare person could ask. \nThe majority (84%) of answers provided by ChatGPT were graded as appropriate.  The study \nsuggests the potential of education (improved patient health literacy) and counseling regarding the \nbasics of cardiovascular prevention that LLMs could provide to patients. Another recent research \nhighlighted ChatGPT’s potential as an assisted d ecision support tool for more straightforward \nclinical questions, but less for questions where general practitioners needed the help of \ncardiologists in decision-making (27,28). \nIn this study, we aim to evaluate the precision of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4.0, GPT-3.5, \nand Google Bard in responding to a range of cardiology-related inquiries. The complexity of these \nquestions spans from entry-level cardiac nursing knowledge to more advanced levels, such as those \nfound in the internal medicine examination, the United States Medical Licensing Examination \n(USMLE) Step 2 and 3 type of clinical scenarios, and up to questions typical of board reviews for \nthe cardiology specialty examination. To the best of our knowledge, the potential applications of \nLLMs in this vertical (across several levels of difficulties) and horizontal (comparing different \nLLMs on the same sets of questions), have not yet been examined. \n \nMethods  \nIn this cross -sectional study, we aimed to make  a comparative analysis of three state -of-the-art \nLLMs: Google Bard, GPT -3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4.0. These models are assessed based on four \ncollections of vignette -based clinical scenarios, differentiated by their levels of complexity and \ndenoted as test sets A, B, C, and D, respectively. A significant portion of the questions featured \nfive potential responses, among which only one was correct. However, a minor fraction of the \nqueries deviated from this format, presenting three, four, six, or seven potential answers instead.  \nThe test set A is composed of 24 queries from the ANA exam  (American Nurses Association) , \nencompassing various clinical situations pertinent to fundamental cardiovascular patient care.

Lastly, test set D incorporates \n90 vignettes mainly based on the current guidelines derived from established board review \nreference books (29,30). Each question sets details together with the results given in Table 1.  \nThe primary goal of this study was to appraise the clinical relevance of the varying responses \ngenerated by the LLMs in response to inquiries seeking medical advice across the clinical \ncontinuum, including cardiovascular prevention, general cardiology, heart failure, arrhythmia, \nacute cardiovascular care management , and finally valvular, myocardial, endocardial and \npericardial pathologies with a strong emphasis towards decision -making for complex c linical \nscenarios. Moreover, we aimed to examine the appropriateness of these responses by determining \nif there were variations based on patient demographics such as age, race, and gender. The outputs \ngenerated from the LLMs were analyzed by a panel of four cardiologists with over ten years of \nprofessional experience in the field. \n \nResults and discussion \nOur findings indicate that GPT-4.0 delivered superior performance across all four sets of questions. \nMoreover, this model exhibited proficiency in integrating complex clinical scenarios, adhering to \ncurrent cardiology guidelines, and interpreting and computing various scores and indices. \nConversely, the GPT-3.5 Turbo model yielded comparatively modest results, on several occasions \nresorting to specul ative answers. In contrast, Google Bard underperformed significantly, \nfrequently evading t o give a direct answer to the given question. Nonetheless, all three models \ndemonstrated a capacity to provide responses perceived as correct, supplemented by explanatory \ncommentary discounting alternative answers. In the following sections, we will highlight five \nvignettes that demonstrate specific characteristics of each LLM. We refer the reader to Appendix \nA for further selected vignettes and their interpretations. \nTable 1: Comparative performance of Google Bard, GPT 3.5 Turbo, and GPT 4.0 on four sets of \nquestions with varied complexity in cardiology. \nTest  Level of difficulty  Google Bard  GPT-3.5 Turbo GPT-4.0  \nA – ANA  Basic (Cardiac nurse)  19/24  20/24  22/24  \nB - ACO  Mixed  15/25  16/25  22/25  \nC - Custom  USMLE-like Step 2/3 Question 31/60  41/60  48/60  \nD - Difficult  Board reviews (Guidelines)  50/90  51/90  76/90  \n .

ANA - American Nurses Association ; ACO - American College of \nOsteopathic Internists , USMLE - United States Medical Licensing Examination . \n \nUnderstanding of Medical Terminology. All models demonstrated the capability to understand, \ninterpret, and utilize the relevant medical terms, demonstrating their training on a broad and diverse \ndataset. Terms related to cardiology pertaining to the human anatomy, medical diagnoses, generic \ndrug names, diagnostic tests and laboratory parameters were correctly identified by all models.  \nGPT-4.0 was the most accurate and proficient, employing medical terminologies appropriately and \naligning its answers with current clinical guidelines. This model demonstrated a deep \nunderstanding of cardiology and  its t erminology related to  corectly interpreting the patient's \nsymptoms, med ical history, management, and treatment. GPT -3.5 Turbo demonstrated good \nunderstanding of the terminology, providing a thorough explanation of each treatment option. \nHowever, the application of these terms in the context of the current clinical guidelines was flawed. \nIt correctly recognized and used the terms , but did not recommend the appropriate next step in  \nmanagement according to the guidelines. On the other hand, Google Bard showed gaps in \nunderstanding of terms, consequently making several inaccurate statements and recommendations. \nFor example , as shown in Table 2 ., GPT-4.0 and GPT -3.5 Turbo presented an exceptional \nunderstanding of cardiological terminology. They accurately interpreted the provided ECG and \nechocardiography findings and deduced the right diagnosis, consequently suggesting adequate \nprocedures. In contrast to GPT -4.0 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, Google Bard struggled in this field, and \nwhile it recognized the reduced ejection fraction and mitral insufficien cy, it neglected the wide \nQRS complex and the importance of cardiac resynchronization therapy. \nHERE TABLE 2. \nAccuracy. Overall, in all tests and levels of difficulty, GPT -4.0 demonstrated superior \nperformance compared to the other two models. For test set A, the LLMs showed relatively similar \nperformance. GPT-4.0 achieved the highest score with 22 out of 24 (92%) correct answers, while \nGoogle Bard and GPT -3.5 Turbo each correctly answered 19 and 20 questions respectively, \nyielding success rates of 79% and 83%  \nThe mixed-level test set B presented a larger performance gap. While both Google Bard and GPT-\n3.5 Turbo correctly answered 15 and 16 out of 25 questions (60% and 64%, respectively), GPT-\n4.0 yielded a success rate of 88% (22 out of 25). \nWhen posed with test set C, all LLMs showed decreased performance compared to previous tests. \nThe success rates for Google Bard , GPT -3.5 Turbo, and GPT 4.0 were 52%, 68%, and 80%,  \nrespectively.    \nLastly, t he most challenging test set D, resulted in the most marked performance differences. \nGoogle Bard scored 50 out of 90 correct answers (55% success rate), GPT-3.5 Turbo had 51 correct \n .

The objective was to determine \nwhether the accuracy of predictions, as indicated by correct answers, is independent of the specific \nmodel. An omnibus Chi-squared test applied to all three LLMs for test sets A (p = 0.472) and B (p \n= 0.063) was not statistically significant. In contrast, results on test set C (p = 0.004) and set D (p \n< 0.001) were statistically significant. Furthermore, the pairwise testing revealed the statistically \nsignificant superiority of GPT-4 over Google Bard on the test set C (p = 0.001) while the difference \nwas not significant compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo (p=0.144). On the test set D, GPT-4.0 results were \nstatistically significantly better as compared to both GPT-3.5 Turbo (p < 0.001) and Google Bard \n(p < 0.001).  \nIt is worth noting that the power of a statistical test, its capacity to detect a genuine effect when it \nexists, can be influenced by the sample size. In this context, the smaller number of questions in the \ninitial two tests might have reduced the test's power, thereby potentially rendering it less sensitive \nin detecting genuine differences in model performance. Even though GPT -4 exhibited superior \nperformance across all tests, the limited number of questions in sets A and B could have diminished \nthe statistical power, resulting in a lack of statistical significance. \nClinical Relevance  and Contextual Understanding . GPT-4.0 demonstrated a strong \nunderstanding of the clinical context and delivered a relevant response that accurately reflected \ncurrent AHA/ACC medical guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol (2018 AHA/ACC \nGuideline on the Management of Blood Choles terol). For example, in the vignette dealing with \nlipid manag ement (Table 3), i ts recommendation to add ezetimibe to the high -intensity statin \ntherapy, owing to the patient's slightly elevated LDL -C level, reflects its proficiency in \nsynthesizing the patient's clinical data and applying it in a clinically appropriate manner. \nFurthermore, this model demonstrated strong contextual understanding, precisely integrating the \npatient's past medical history, current symptoms, and lipid profile results in its answer. In contrast, \nGPT-3.5 Turbo, while demonstrating a good conceptual understanding, referencing the patient's \nhistory, current statin therapy, and the lipid profile in its explanation and explaining each treatment \noption clearly, failed to align its final recommendation with current medical guidelines.  Google \nBard demonstrated some ability to understand the context. In the same example, i t accurately \nrecognized that the patient had an acute MI and that his LDL-C was above target, but it inaccurately \ncategorized atorvastatin as a moderate -intensity statin and re commended switching to \nevolocumab, a change in treatment that is not supported by current medical guidelines . \nFurthermore, in the vignette presented in Table 4, when asked to recom mend the necessity for \nurgent hospital admission according to presented clinical findings , it is interesting to notice that, \nin addition to giving the incorrect answer, Google Bard provides contradicting arguments that lack \nclarity and put in question its contextual understanding of a given clinical scenario. \n .

Each of them sometimes turned towards a “safer” option, proposing \nmore advanced diagnostic or therapeutic approaches when they would be u nnecessary or \nanticipatory. As shown in Table 5, GPT-4 managed to avoid the fallacy and suggested intravenous \nbenzodiazepines for cocaine-induced chest pain, suggesting that phentolamine is not the first line \nof treatment , while GPT-3.5 Turbo and Google Bard chose immediate treatment with \nphentolamine.  \nComprehensibility. All three models yield outputs that manifest a high level of comprehensibility, \ndemonstrating the potential utility of these models in relaying complex medical information to \ndiverse audiences. The models' responses are coherent, structured, and detailed, effectively \ntranslating the complex nuances of medical jargon into more accessible language. Critically, each \nmodel demonstrates an ability to discern important clinical details from the input information, \nprocess this information in the context of their underlying medical knowl edge, and generate \nappropriate responses. All models commented on the offered answers with an explanation of why, \naccording to their judgment, a certain answer was correct and others incorrect. This is of paramount \nimportance in patient communication, wher ein a thorough understanding of the situation and \nrationale for management strategies enhances patient adherence to medical advice.  \nIn this analysis, GPT -4.0 demonstrated impressive capacity in identifying and applying relevant \nclinical guidelines to hypothetical patient scenarios. Google Bard, in contrast, occasionally veers \nfrom standard clinical guidelines. This divergence can be counterproductive in patient education, \nwhere consistency with established medical guidelines is vital. For example, in a question where \na patient asks for a second opinion about her condition (Table 3), GPT-4 clearly explains the best \ncourse of action, supporting his answer with guidelines. The answer is worded in a concise manner, \nwhere the rules of the profession come to t he fore, but it should also be comprehensive to the \npatient. Similarly, GPT-3.5 Turbo also provided the correct answer  with adequate explanation \nwhich seems just a bit less polished . Google Bar d explained the significance of mitral \ninsufficiency, however, it disregarded the cardiac dyssynchrony present in this case. \nHERE TABLE 5. \nReliability. Among the three models, GPT -4.0 shows the highest level of reliability, with \nconsistent application of clinical guidelines and consistency in generating responses. It maintains \nthis consistency over time and across diverse queries, suggesting a degree of stability in its \nunderlying architecture and training.  On the other hand, GPT -3.5 Turbo and Google Bard, have \nbeen observed to exhibit fluctuation in their replies when presented with the same query at different \ntimes. Intriguingly, when these models produce an incorrect answer, they frequently alter that \nanswer when queried again at a later moment, but the revised response is often also incorrect. This \nwas not observed when the initially generated response was correct, implying a degree of \n .

Moreover, there were two questions where GPT -3.5 Turbo began \nby endorsing one response, only to transition towards an alternate response by the conclusion of \nthe generated reply. Additionally, Google Bard also exhibited instances of internal contradiction \nwithin its responses (see Table 4). \nValidation with Clinical Trials and Guidelines.  During this investigation, it was observed that \nGPT-4.0 rendered responses that adhered to the contemporary AHA/ASA guidelines, a \nrepresentative example of which is showcased in Table 3. Furthermore, the model's aptness in \nmirroring the guidelines was foun d to be accurate within the context of the presented clinical \nscenario. However, it is important to note that this model's responses were predicated on the \nguidelines published until September 2021.  Yet another example can be seen in Table 6. where \nboth GPT-4 and Google Bard referenced the guidelines, with Google Bard mentioning the exact \nExpert Consensus Statement. They gave the correct recommendation to start beta-blockers for long \nQT interval , while GPT -3.5 Turbo, suggested ICD implantation  and neglected beta -blockers. \nCompared to GTP -4.0, Google Bard, despite referencing medical guidelines, exhibited \ninconsistent application relative to the presented clinical scenario.  Finally, none of the assessed \nmodels, including GPT-4.0, demonstrated any capacity to reference or consider ongoing clinical \ntrials within their responses. \nHERE TABLE 6. \nSpeed and Efficiency.  In a real -world clinical environment, the speed and efficiency of large \nlanguage models (LLMs) are critical parameters, as timely response generation can be essential.  \nHowever, accurately quantifying the execution time of each LLM can be challenging, as their \nspeed is susceptible to fluctuation depending on user load. Let us also note that GPT -3.5 Turbo \nand GPT-4.0 continually stream their responses, providing incremental outputs and reducing the \nperceived wait time. In contrast, Google Bard holds back its outputs, delivering the complete text \nfollowing a slight delay. \n \nImage 1. Images represent the user interface of the 'Dubravka' mobile application, specifically \ndesigned within this research. This digital health tool incorporates the GPT-3.5 Turbo Application \nProgramming Interface (API) , thus enabling the LLM to interact with unique health data from \nindividual users. Consequently, the application can generate tailored advice, with emphasis on \nareas such as dietary habits, lifestyle modifications, an d cardiovascular prevention strategies.  In \naddition, the application includes a feature that facilitates the summarization of a patient's medical \nhistory, potentially aiding in the communication between patients and healthcare professionals. \n .

Personalization is a critical attribute for LLMs that centers around interpreting \nand incorporating user-specific information into their responses. In the present study, we leveraged \nthis attribute by incorporating patient-specific medical history data into the model via a mobile \napplication1. The application interacts with the GPT -3.5 Turbo API (Application Programming \nInterface), allowing the LLM to process individual health data and generate personali zed advice, \nprimarily focusing on diet, cardiovascular prevention, and lifestyle recommendations. This mode \nof interaction presents an innovative use case for LLMs in enhancing patient -centric healthcare \nservices. The ability to provide tailored advice based on specif ic health profiles highlights the \npotential of LLMs in improving patient engagement and fostering a proactive approach to personal \nhealth management. \nAdaptability to Different Sub -Domains. The robust performance of GPT -4.0, GPT-3.5 Turbo, \nand Google Bard in complex cardiological scenarios indicates a comprehensive understanding of \nmedical literature and the ability to apply intricate clinical guidelines, suggestive of their potential \napplicability to other medical fields. Their responses demons trate a capacity for synthesizing and \npresenting complex medical information concisely and accurately, equally valuable  qualities \nacross all medical sub-domains. \nHowever, one must also consider the breadth and depth of the models' training data. As their \ncapabilities are inherently shaped by the corpus they were trained on, their efficacy across different \nmedical domains may vary based on the representation of those domains in the original dataset. \nTherefore, while we may anticipate a degree of adaptability , evaluating their performance \nindividually within each target sub -domain is advisable to ensure precision and validity.  \n \nConclusion \nDespite the several decades of integration of AI into our lives, the escalating use of AI in various \ndomains, particularly healthcare, has intensified concerns and sparked imaginations. In healthcare, \nthese concerns are amplified, giving rise to numerous questions about bioethics, usage, relevancy, \nand accuracy. \nThis contribution outlines the benchmarking of three different large language models, GPT -4.0, \nGPT-3.5 Turbo, and Google Bard, in responding to complex clinical scenarios in cardiology. The \nmodels were evaluated on their understanding and use of medical terminology, clinical relevance, \ncontextual understanding, accuracy, ability to adhere to clinical guidelines, and others. \nWhile all three models displayed impressive capacities in handling complex cardiological \nscenarios, GPT-4.0 emerged as the most reliable, accurate, and guideline-compliant among them. \nThis capacity for contextual understanding and a clear evidence -based approach underscores its \nhigh applicability in a real-world clinical setting. Despite this, it is crucial to note that the models' \nperformances still do not supersede human knowledge and their comprehensive use in decision -\n \n1 Dubravka, mobile application source code https://github.com/apptonio/dubravka \n .

Current medications include carvedilol, ramipril, furosemide, magnesium, potassium and \nspironolactone which she has been taking for two years.

Cardiac resynchronization is indicated \n  \nCardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is beneficial in patients with heart failure with reduced \nejection fraction (HFrEF), especially those with left bundle branch block, as it improves cardiac \nefficiency and can relieve symptoms of heart failure. CRT is indicat ed in patients with LVEF ≤ 35%, \nsymptomatic heart failure (NYHA class II, III, or ambulatory IV), sinus rhythm, and left bundle branch \nblock with a QRS duration ≥130 ms, despite at least 3 months of guideline -directed medical therapy, \nlike in this patient. \n  \nThe other options may not be the best choices based on the information given: \nB. Mitral valve replacement might be indicated if mitral valve repair is not possible or if the patient has \nsevere symptomatic mitral regurgitation despite optimal medical the rapy, but it's typically not the first \nchoice due to associated surgical risks. \nC. Mitral valve annuloplasty repair might be indicated if there was severe mitral regurgitation primarily \ndue to annular dilatation, but this needs further evaluation. \nD. Transcatheter mitral valve intervention might be considered in high surgical risk patients with severe \nsymptomatic mitral regurgitation despite optimal medical therapy, but it's also typically not the first \nchoice, especially in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy where CRT could be beneficial. \n  \nGPT-3.5 Turbo: A. Cardiac resynchronization is indicated \n  \nIn this case, the patient has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) in the setting of idiopathic dilated \ncardiomyopathy. The presence of left bundle branch block a nd a low ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% \nsuggests a dyssynchronous ventricular contraction, which can be addressed with cardiac \nresynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT involves the placement of a biventricular pacemaker to \nsynchronize the contraction of the ventricles and improve overall cardiac function. \nOption B, mitral valve replacement, is not the first-line treatment for severe MR in the absence of other \nindications such as significant symptoms or structural valve damage. \nOption C, annuloplasty repair, may be considered as a surgical treatment option in some cases, but the \nmost appropriate initial step in management is to address the underlying cardiac dysfunction and \ndyssynchrony with CRT. \nOption D, transcatheter mitral valve intervention, may be consider ed in select cases of severe MR, but \nthe primary focus should be on addressing the underlying cardiomyopathy and dyssynchrony with CRT. \nTherefore, the most correct statement in this case is that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is \nindicated. \n  \nGoogle Bard: The answer is **(B). The patient should receive mitral valve replacement.** \n  \nThe patient in this question has severe mitral regurgitation, which is a condition in which blood flows \nbackward from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole. This can cause the left ventricle to \nenlarge and eventually fail. \nThe patient's echocardiogram also reveals a LVEF of 30%, which is considered to be severely reduced. \nThis means that the left ventricle is not pumping blood as effectively as it should be. \nThe presence of severe mitral regurgitation and severely reduced LVEF is an indication for mitral valve \nreplacement. Mitral valve replacement is a surgical procedure that involves replacing the diseased mitral \nvalve with a mechanical or biological valve. This will improve the patient's symptoms and reduce their \nrisk of complications, such as heart failure and stroke. \nThe other answer choices are not as appropriate in this case. \n .

It is not indicated for patients with severe mitral \nregurgitation. \n* **Annuloplasty repair:** Annuloplasty repair is a procedure that can be used to tighten the mitral \nannulus. It is not indicated for patients with severe mitral regurgitation. \n* **Transcatheter mitral valve intervention:** Transcatheter mitral valve intervention is a minimally \ninvasive procedure that can be used to repair a leaking mitral valve. It is not indicated for patients with \nsevere mitral regurgitation. \nNote: GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 Turbo agree on option A. They both justify this based on the patient's presentation of left \nbundle branch block and reduced ejection fraction, which suggests a dyssynchronous ventricular contraction. Cardiac \nresynchronization therapy (CRT) is beneficial in these patients. On the other hand, Google Bard suggests option B, \nwhere the patient should receive mitral valve replacement due to the severe mitral regurgitation and the sev erely \nreduced LVEF, which is not the first-line treatment for severe mitral regurgitation in the absence of other indications \nsuch as significant symptoms or structural valve damage. Based on the available information, the response of GPT -\n4.0 and GPT-3.5 Turbo seems more appropriate. Nevertheless, it's crucial to remember that this is a complex clinical \nsituation, and the final decision should always be based on a detailed evaluation by a healthcare provider.  \n \nTable 3. The table presents the clinical scenario of a 50 -year-old man experiencing chest pain, \ndetailing his medical history, symptoms, treatment, and follow -up. It concludes with a \nmultiple-choice question regarding optimal lipid management strategy. \nQuestion: A 50 year -old man presents to the emergency department with chest pain. While having an \nemotional argument with his wife, he suddenly developed left-sided substernal chest pain that radiated \nto his left jaw with associated diaphoresis and shortness of breath. He took aspirin 325 mg at home and \ncalled emergency medical services. Upon arrival of emergency services, the patient’s pain improved \nwith two tablets of sublingual nitroglycerin but mild discomfort and dyspnea persisted. His past medical \nhistory is notable for hyperlipidemia,  for which he takes atorvastatin 40 mg. Upon arrival to the \nemergency department, his temperature is 37.6 °C, heart rate 92 bpm, blood pressure 174/98 mmHg \n(similar in both arms), respiratory rate 20/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He appears \nuncomfortable. Jugular venous pressure is estimated at 6 cm H2O. Lung fields are clear to auscultation \nbilaterally. Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and no extra heart sounds. \nExtremities reveal good distal pulses and are warm without peripheral edema. The ECG is indicative of \nWellens’ syndrome. He was promptly taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to \nhave a 99% proximal LAD stenosis with TIMI-2 flow without other significant coronary artery disease. \nPrasugrel 60 mg was administered and an everolimus -eluting stent was successfully placed.

According to \nthe 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guidelines, in very high -risk ASCVD patients, if LDL-C remains ≥70 \nmg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, ezetimibe is recommended as the next drug to add. \nOnly if the LDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/dL after addition of ezetimibe, or if ezetimibe is not tolerated, \nis a PCSK9 inhibitor (such as evolocumab) recommended. \nHence, the most appropriate next step would be to continue the current high -intensity statin and add \nezetimibe. \nThe correct answer is: \nB) Continue atorvastatin 80 and start ezetimibe 10 mg. \n  \nGPT-3.5 Turbo: In this case, the patient presented with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and \nreceived percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. The subsequent lipid panel \nresults show an LDL-C of 80 mg/dL, HDL-C of 48 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 189 mg/dL. Based on \nthis information, let's analyze the options to determine the best regimen for lipid management: \nA. Continue atorvastatin 80. \nThis option suggests continuing the patient's current reg imen of atorvastatin 80 mg. This dose of \natorvastatin is considered a high -intensity statin therapy, which is the preferred treatment for patients \nwith established coronary artery disease (CAD). Continuing atorvastatin 80 mg would be appropriate \nfor LDL-C management. \nB. Continue atorvastatin 80 and start ezetimibe 10. \nAdding ezetimibe to the patient's current atorvastatin regimen is a reasonable option for further LDL-C \nreduction. Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption in the intestines and can be used a s an adjunct to \nstatin therapy for additional LDL-C lowering. \nC. Continue atorvastatin 80 and start fenofibrate 130. \nFenofibrate is primarily used to target elevated triglyceride levels and increase HDL-C levels. However, \nin this case, the patient's primary concern is LDL -C management rather than elevated triglycerides. \nWhile fenofibrate may have some benefits in certain patients, it is not the best choice for lipid \nmanagement in this scenario. \nD. Stop atorvastatin and start evolocumab. \nEvolocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor, a newer class of medications used to further lower LDL-C. However, \nit is generally reserved for patients with very high LDL -C or familial hypercholesterolemia who have \nnot achieved adequate LDL -C reduction with maximally tolera ted statin therapy and other lipid -\nlowering medications. Stopping atorvastatin, a high -intensity statin, would not be appropriate in this \ncase. \nConsidering the patient's history of acute MI, the current regimen of atorvastatin 80 mg should be \ncontinued, as it is a high-intensity statin and the preferred treatment for patients with established CAD. \nOption A is the most appropriate choice for lipid management in this scenario. \nTherefore, the best regimen for lipid management in this case is: \nA. Continue atorvastatin 80. \nGoogle Bard: The answer is **D. Stop atorvastatin and start evolocumab.** \n \nThe patient in the question had an acute myocardial infarction (MI) due to a 99% mid -LAD lesion. He \nwas treated with a stent and discharged on atorvastatin 80 mg, in addition to aspirin 81 mg, prasugrel 10 \nmg, metoprolol XL 50 mg, and lisinopril 10 mg. \nA repeat lipid panel in outpatient cardiology clinic 6 weeks post -MI revealed an LDL-C of 80 mg/dL, \nHDL-C of 48 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 189 mg/dL. These lipid levels a re not optimal for a patient \nwho has had an MI. The target LDL-C level for patients who have had an MI is <70 mg/dL.  \nAtorvastatin 80 mg is a moderate-intensity statin. In order to achieve an LDL-C level of <70 mg/dL, the \npatient may need to be started on a high-intensity statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin 10 mg. \n .

Prasugrel can \nincrease the risk of muscle injury, especially when used in combination with high-intensity statins. \nEvolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets PCSK9, a protein that helps to regulate cholesterol \nlevels. Evolocumab is a very effective medication for lowering LDL -C levels. It can be used in \ncombination with statins or as a single agent. In the patient in the question, evolocumab would be a good \noption for lowering LDL-C levels without increasing the risk of muscle injury. \nThe other answer choices are not as appropriate. \n* **Option A** is not appropriate because atorvastatin 80 mg is not enough to achieve an LDL-C level \nof <70 mg/dL. \n* **Option B** is not appropriate because ezetimibe is a bile acid sequestrant. Bile acid sequestrants \ncan interact with prasugrel, increasing the risk of muscle injury. \n* **Option C** is not appropriate becaus e fenofibrate is a fibrate. Fibrates can increase the risk of \nmuscle injury, especially when used in combination with statins. \nNote: GPT-4.0 provides an accurate and detailed analysis. The patient is post-MI and has an LDL-C level of 80 mg/dL, \nslightly above the ideal target of <70 mg/dL for secondary prevention in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular \ndisease (ASCVD). GPT-4.0 correctly suggests the addition of ezetimibe according to the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol \nguidelines for very high -risk ASCVD p atients, if LDL -C remains ≥70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin \ntherapy. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 Turbo begins by accurately detailing the patient's condition and reviewing each \nof the provided options. However, it chooses option A) as the most ap propriate choice, failing to recommend the \naddition of ezetimibe to reach the target LDL -C of <70 mg/dL. While it correctly identifies the purpose and usage of \nthe other medications, it does not correctly apply the AHA/ACC cholesterol guidelines for very h igh-risk ASCVD \npatients in its conclusion. Google Bard makes several mistakes. Firstly, it incorrectly states that atorvastatin 80 mg is \na moderate-intensity statin when in fact it is a high-intensity statin. It also suggests that the patient is at risk of muscle \ninjury due to his prasugrel medication, which is inaccurate - prasugrel is an antiplatelet drug and does not increase the \nrisk of muscle injury. Furthermore, Google Bard incorrectly recommends evolocumab (option D) as the appropriate \nmedication to lower LDL-C levels. While evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor, can effectively lower LDL-C, it is usually \nonly recommended when patients fail to achieve LDL-C targets with maximally tolerated statins and ezetimibe. These \nanswers highlight some limitations of the se models related to staying current with treatment guidelines and \nunderstanding the interactions and indications of various medications. \n \nTable 4.

Physical examination findings of parvus et tardus (diminished and delayed carotid pulse), a systolic \nmurmur heard best at the upper sternal border, and an absent S2 suggest aortic stenosis, a serious condition \nthat may require intervention. \nE. An ECG demonstrating right bundle branch block and ST elevations in V1 -V3 is suggestive of a \nBrugada pattern, which is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. \n  \nGPT-3.5 Turbo: The finding that would not typically require hospital admission for evaluation is: \nD. Physical examination demonstrating parvus et tardus, systolic murmur heard best at upper \nsternal border and absent S2 \nThis physical examination finding sug gests aortic stenosis, which is a chronic condition that may not \nnecessitate immediate hospital admission unless there are acute complications or hemodynamic instability. \nEvaluation and management of aortic stenosis can be performed in an outpatient setting. \nOn the other hand, the other options are indicative of more concerning conditions that may require \nimmediate evaluation and treatment: \nA. ECG demonstrating sinus pause of 2 s: Sinus pause can indicate sinus node dysfunction or other \narrhythmias, which may require further evaluation and monitoring in a hospital setting. \nB. Physical examination demonstrating elevated jugular venous pressure, rales on lung examination, and \nlower extremity edema: These findings suggest congestive heart failure, which may require admission for \nfurther evaluation and management. \nC. Family history of sudden cardiac death: This raises concern for inherited cardiac conditions and may \nnecessitate evaluation and risk stratification in a hospital setting. \nE. ECG with Right bundle branch block and ST elevations in V1-V3: This ECG pattern can be indicative \nof acute myocardial infarction, particularly involving the right ventricle. Immediate evaluation and \ntreatment in a hospital setting is necessary. \nGoogle Bard: The answer is **(B). P hysical examination demonstrating elevated jugular venous \npressure, rales on lung examination, and lower extremity edema.** \n All of the other findings listed should prompt hospital admission for evaluation. \n* **ECG demonstrating sinus pause of 2 s:** A sinus pause is a pause in the heart's rhythm that is caused \nby a temporary interruption in the electrical signal that controls the heart rate. A sinus pause of 2 s is \nconsidered to be prolonged and can be a sign of a serious underlying heart condition. \n* **Family history of sudden cardiac death:** Sudden cardiac death is the sudden and unexpected death \nof a person who appears to be in good health. It is often caused by a heart arrhythmia. A family history of \nsudden cardiac death is a risk factor for developing a heart arrhythmia yourself. \n* **Physical examination demonstrating parvus et tardus, systolic murmur heard best at upper sternal \nborder and absent S2:** Parvus et tardus is a type of heart murmur that is caused by a narrowing of the \naortic valve. An absent S2 is a sign that the aortic valve is not closing properly. These findings can be a \nsign of aortic stenosis, a serious heart valve condition. \n* **ECG with Right bundle branch block and ST elevations in V1–V3:** Right bundle branch block is a \ncondition that affects the electrical conduction system of the heart. It can cause a heart arrhythmia. ST \nelevations in V1–V3 are a sign of a heart attack. \nTherefore, the only finding that should not prompt hospital admission for evaluation is **physical \nexamination demonstrating elevated jugular venous pressure, rales on lung examination, and lower \nextremity edema.** These findings are more likely to be caused by a condition other than a heart problem, \nsuch as heart failure. \nNote: The key to this question is to consider whether each finding could potentially indicate a life -threatening \ncondition or a need for immediate hospital -based treatment.

While this finding may require further evaluation, such as a Holter monitor \nto assess for more significant arrhythmias, it doesn't necessarily indicate a need for hospital admission unless it is \nassociated with symptoms like syncope or dizziness . However, GPT -3.5 Turbo believes that option D may not \nnecessitate immediate hospital admission. This finding could suggest aortic stenosis, a chronic condition that may be \nmanaged in an outpatient setting unless there are acute complications or hemodynamic instability. On the other hand, \nGoogle Bard suggests that option B should not prompt hospital admission. This answer seems less likely to be correct \nbecause these symptoms together suggest congestive heart failure, which often does require hospital trea tment, \nespecially if the patient is symptomatic or there is potential for acute decompensation.  \n \nTable 5. The table presents the case of a 25 -year-old woman with chest pain, nausea, and a \nheadache after cocaine use. It offers a detailed account of her medical condition, including \nvitals and examination results, with a multiple-choice question about the most suitable next \nstep in her treatment. \nQuestion: A 25-year-old woman reports an intense chest pain that is localized in the middle of the chest \nand th e upper sternal area, which lasts for 3 hours. She also describes nausea and a mild occipital \nheadache. She reveales to have inhaled cocaine shortly prior to her episode of chest pain. Her family \nhistory is clear of coronary artery disease. Blood pressure is 200/105 mmHg on both arms. Pulse is \n105/min and regular. Oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.  Heart sounds are normal and no murmurs \nare heard. Lower extremity pulses are lull and symmetric, there is no peripheral edema. ECG shows sinus \ntachycardia, o therwise unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in \nmanagement of this patient?  \nA. Aspirin and clopidogrel at loading dose \nB. Intravenous lorazepam \nC. Intravenous metoprolol \nD. Intravenous phentolamine \nE. Low-molecular-weight heparin \n  \nGPT-4.0: The correct answer is: B. Intravenous lorazepam \nThe presentation is suggestive of cocaine-induced chest pain. Cocaine induces coronary artery \nvasoconstriction and a hyperadrenergic state which may lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction. It \nalso increases myocardial oxygen demand due to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial \ncontractility. The management of chest pain following cocaine use is supportive and includes: \n1. Oxygen to treat any hypoxemia. \n2. Benzodiazepines (like lorazepam) to relieve anxiety and decrease sympathetic output, which can \nhelp reduce heart rate and blood pressure. \n3. Nitroglycerin to relieve coronary artery vasospasm. \n4. Aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation. \nBeta blockers are contraindicated in the acute setting of cocaine-induced chest pain because they can \nlead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation and worsen coronary vasoconstriction. So option C \nshould be avoided. \nPhentolamine is a nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist. While it can theoretically be used to treat \ncocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction, it is not first line treatment because of its potential to cause \na reflex tachycardia.  \nAnticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is typically not necessary in the setting of cocaine-\ninduced chest pain, unless acute coronary syndrome is confirmed. Therefore, option E is also not \nappropriate as the first next step. \n .

Intravenous phentolamine. \nThe patient's intense chest pain, occipital headache, and history of recent cocaine use suggest the \npossibility of cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia or infarction. Cocaine can cause vasoconstriction, \nincreased heart rate, and increased blood pressure, leading to increased myocardial oxygen demand and \npotentially triggering ischemic events. \nIntravenous phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, is the treatment of choice for cocaine-\ninduced hypertension and coronary artery vasoconstriction. It helps reverse the vasoconstrictive effects \nof cocaine by blocking alpha-receptors and reducing peripheral vascular resistance. Prompt \nadministration of phentolamine can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further myocardial damage. \nOption A (aspirin and clopidogrel at loading dose) is not the most appropriate choice in this case. \nWhile antiplatelet therapy is indicated in acute coronary syndromes, the primary issue in this patient is \nthe acute cocaine-induced vasoconstriction rather than atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.  \nOption B (intravenous lorazepam) is a benzodiazepine that may help with anxiety or agitation, but it \ndoes not directly address the underlying cocaine-induced vasoconstriction and hypertension. \nOption C (intravenous metoprolol) is a beta-blocker that is contraindicated in the setting of acute \ncocaine intoxication. Beta-blockers can exacerbate the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine and may lead \nto unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects. \nOption E (low-molecular-weight heparin) is not the most appropriate choice in this acute setting. While \nanticoagulation may be warranted in certain cases of myocardial ischemia or infarction, the primary \nissue in this patient is the acute cocaine-induced vasoconstriction rather than a thrombotic event. \n To summarize, in a patient with intense chest pain, hypertension, and a history of recent cocaine use, \nthe most appropriate next step in management is D. Intravenous phentolamine to reverse cocaine-\ninduced vasoconstriction and hypertension. It is important to address the acute effects of cocaine before \nconsidering additional treatments or interventions. \nGoogle Bard: The answer is D. Intravenous phentolamine. \nThe patient in this case is presenting with symptoms of cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Cocaine \ncan cause the coronary arteries to constrict, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and even \ndeath. \nThe patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is a sign of increased heart rate. However, the ECG \nis otherwise unremarkable, which suggests that there is no significant damage to the heart muscle. \nThe best next step in management of this patient is to administer intravenous phentolamine. \nPhentolamine is a medication that can be used to relax the coronary arteries and relieve vasospasm. \nThe other answer choices are not as appropriate in this case. Aspirin and clopidogrel are medications \nthat are used to prevent blood clots, but they are not effective in treating cocaine-induced coronary \nvasospasm. Intravenous lorazepam is a medication that can be used to treat anxiety, but it is not \neffective in treating cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Intravenous metoprolol is a medication that \ncan be used to treat high blood pressure, but it is not effective in treating cocaine-induced coronary \nvasospasm. Low-molecular-weight heparin is a medication that can be used to prevent blood clots, but \nit is not effective in treating cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. \nNote: GPT-4.0 correctly identifies that the patient is likely experiencing coca ine-induced chest pain and accurately \nstates that the management of this condition is mostly supportive. It correctly highlights the use of benzodiazepine to \ndecrease sympathetic output and points out that beta -blockers are contraindicated in the acute set ting of cocaine -\ninduced chest pain.

Provides a case of a 34 -year-old asymptomatic woman with an ECG finding of a long \nQT interval with a multi ple-choice question about the most suitable next step in her \ntreatment. \nQuestion: Miss Johnson is an asymptomatic 34 yo woman who presents for breast biopsy and ECG finds \nlong QT interval >470 ms.Which describes the best treatment option? \n A. Patient needs to be started on beta blocker and followed for symptoms \n B. Patient needs no further treatment since asymptomatic \nC. Patient is a candidate for biventricular pacemaker set at heart rate faster than her intrinsic rate \n D. Patient is a candidate for ICD \n E. Patient needs ETT first to make further decisions \nGPT-4.0: Long QT syndrome can be a serious and potentially life-threatening heart condition. It \ncan cause sudden, uncontrollable, dangerous arrhythmias in response to exercise or stress. \nFrom the options given, the best course of action would be: \nA. \"Patient needs to be started on beta blocker and followed for symptoms\" \nBeta blockers are the first-line treatment for long QT syndrome, even in asymptomatic individuals. They \nblock the effects of adrenaline on your heart, which can prevent the onset of dangerous arrhythmias.  \nOptions B and E are not appropr iate, as asymptomatic status does not negate the need for treatment or \nfurther testing in long QT syndrome.  \nOption C is not typically used in managing long QT syndrome. Biventricular pacing is generally reserved \nfor conditions that cause ventricular dyssy nchrony like certain types of heart failure, not primary \narrhythmia syndromes like long QT. \nOption D, an ICD, might be considered in patients with long QT syndrome who have had a cardiac arrest, \nor in cases that are refractory to medical management, but it's not generally the first line of treatment.  \nFinally, all individuals with long QT syndrome should be educated about avoiding QT prolonging \nmedications, maintaining good hydration and electrolyte balance, and promptly addressing any symptoms \nsuggestive of arrhythmias. \nPlease note, while I aim to provide accurate information, patients with long QT syndrome should be \nevaluated and managed by a healthcare professional with expertise in this area. This information is based \non general guidelines and may not be applicable to all patients. \nGPT-3.5 Turbo: In the case of Miss Johnson, an asymptomatic 34-year-old woman with a long QT \ninterval (>470 ms) found on the EKG, the best treatment option would be: \nD. Patient is a candidate for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). \nA prolonged QT interval on an EKG can increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, such as torsades \nde pointes, which can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, the primary concern is preventing sudden \ncardiac death in individuals with a prolonged QT interval. \nIn this scenario, the best treatment option would be an ICD. An ICD is a device that can detect and treat \nlife-threatening arrhythmias by delivering an electric shock to restore normal heart rhythm. As Miss \nJohnson is asymp tomatic but has a prolonged QT interval, she is at risk for potentially dangerous \narrhythmias, making her a candidate for an ICD. \nThe other options mentioned are not appropriate in this context: \nA. Patient needs to be started on a beta-blocker and followed for symptoms: While beta-blockers can be \npart of the treatment for some forms of long QT syndrome, in this scenario, where the patient is \nasymptomatic but has a prolonged QT interval, an ICD is the more appropriate choice. \n .

Patient needs no furt her treatment since asymptomatic: Asymptomatic individuals with a prolonged \nQT interval are still at risk of developing life -threatening arrhythmias, and therefore, treatment is \nnecessary. \nC. Patient is a candidate for a biventricular pacemaker set at a he art rate faster than her intrinsic rate: \nBiventricular pacemakers are typically used for patients with heart failure and conduction system \nabnormalities, and they are not the primary treatment for long QT syndrome. \nE. Patient needs an exercise treadmill test (ETT) first to make further decisions: An ETT is typically used \nto assess exercise capacity and evaluate symptoms related to exercise. In the case of long QT syndrome, \nthe primary concern is the risk of arrhythmias rather than exercise-induced symptoms. \nTherefore, the correct answer is: \nD. Patient is a candidate for an ICD. \nGoogle Bard: The answer is **A. Patient needs to be started on beta blocker and followed for \nsymptoms**. \nLong QT syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the heart's electrical system. It can cause a prolonged \nQT interval on an ECG, which can lead to arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. \nPatients with long QT syndrome are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The 2020 \nACC/AHA/HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Long QT Syndrome recommends that patients with \nlong QT syndrome be started on beta blockers. Beta blockers can help to shorten the QT interval and \nreduce the risk of SCD. \nPatients with long QT syndrome should also be followed for symptoms. Symptoms of long QT syndrome \ncan include syncope (fainting), palpitations, and seizures. If a patient with long QT syndrome experiences \nsymptoms, they should be seen by a doctor immediately. \nThe other answer choices are incorrect. Option B is incorrect because patients with long QT syndrome \nare at increased risk of SCD, even if they are asymptomatic. Option C is incorrect because biventricular \npacemakers are not used to treat long QT syndrome. Option D is incorrect because ICDs are not the first-\nline treatment for long QT syndrome . Option E is incorrect because an ETT (exercise treadmill test) is \nnot necessary to make a decision about treatment for long QT syndrome.  \nTherefore, the patient in this question should be started on beta blockers and followed for symptoms. \nNote: GPT-4.0, and Google Bard, agree that the patient should be started on a beta-blocker and closely monitored for \nsymptoms. They agree on this approach primarily because beta blockers, as first-line treatment, can mitigate the effects \nof adrenaline on the heart, thu s preventing potentially dangerous arrhythmias in patients with Long QT syndrome. \nBoth models emphasize the importance of treating asymptomatic individuals and dismiss the use of a biventricular \npacemaker or an implantable cardioverter -defibrillator (ICD) as initial treatment. However, GPT -4.0 acknowledges \nthat an ICD could be considered for patients with refractory conditions. Conversely, GPT -3.5 Turbo suggests that \nMiss Johnson should receive an ICD due to her increased risk of potentially lethal arrhythmias. This model prioritizes \nthe prevention of sudden cardiac death and views ICD as the more suitable option despite the patient’s asymptomatic \nstatus. This contrast in responses between GPT-3.5 Turbo and the other two models underscores the critical importance \nof context-specific and patient-centered approaches in healthcare decisions. \n .
