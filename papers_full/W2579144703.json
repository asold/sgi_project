The student queried whether the use of a para-\nphrasing tool was acceptable in the preparation of a written submission for assessment.\nDiscussing the matter further, the student revealed that they had queried the writing\nprovided by one member of the group as their contribution to the report “did not\nmake sense ”. When asked, the group member stated that they had taken material from\nInternational Journal for\n     Educational Integrity\n© The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\nLicense (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and\nindicate if changes were made.\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 \nDOI 10.1007/s40979-016-0013-y\na journal article and used a fee free Internet paraphrasing tool “so that the words were\nnot the same as the original to avoid plagiarism ”. After the clarification, the group did\nnot accept the submission from their team member and instead worked with them to\ndevelop an original submission. The group were thanked for their approach to the\nsituation; however this revelation provided a potential explanation for some analogous\nsubmissions for previous subjects.\nOne particular submission from a previous subject instance had phrasing that\nincluded “constructive employee execution ” and “worker execution audits ” for an as-\nsessment topic on employee performance rev iews. The student was interviewed at the\ntime about why they had submitted work relating the words execution and employees\nand no satisfactory or plausible explanat ion was provided. With a new awareness of\nparaphrasing tools, a Google search revealed in excess of 500,000 hits and a simple\nstatement was entered into one tool to test this connection. Testing the phrase ‘em-\nployee performance reviews ’ via the top search response revealed an explanation for\nthe unusual student submission as the paraphrase was returned as ‘representative exe-\ncution surveys ’. Choosing to use output generated by these tools begs the question –\nis it original work, patchwriting or facilitated plagiarism?\nHaving had our attention drawn to the existence and use of paraphrasing tools it\nwas decided to investigate the phenomenon . What became apparent was that the ease\nof access to and use of such tools was greater than first thought. Consequently it is\nimportant to bring the use and operation of paraphrasing tools to a wider audience to\nencourage discussion about developing individual writing skills and improve the de-\ntection of these emerging practices, thereby raising awareness for students, teachers\nand institutions.\nParaphrasing and patchwriting\nAcademic writing is largely reliant on the skill of paraphrasing to demonstrate that the\nauthor can capture the essence of what they have read, they understand what they have\nread and can use the appropriately acknowledged evidence in support of their re-\nsponses (Fillenbaum, 1970; Keck, 2006, 2014; Shi, 2012). In higher education a student ’s\nattempts at paraphrasing can provide “insight into how well students read as well as\nwrite” (Hirvela & Du, 2013, p.88). While there appears to be an underlying assumption\nthat students and researchers understand and accept that there is a standard conven-\ntion about how to paraphrase and appropriately use and acknowledge source texts (Shi,\n2012), there can be inconsistencies between underlying assumptions in how para-\nphrases are identified, described and assessed (Keck, 2006). Poorer forms of paraphras-\ning tend to use a simplistic approach where some words are simply replaced with\nsynonyms found through functionality available in word processing software or online\ndictionaries. This is a form of superficial paraphrasing or ‘close paraphrasing ’ (Keck,\n2010) or ‘patchwriting’(Howard, 1995). The question as to “the exact degree to which\ntext must be modified to be classified as correctly paraphrased ” (Roig, 2001, p.309) is\nsomewhat vague, although Keck (2006) outlined a Taxonomy of Paraphrase Types\nwhere paraphrases are classified in four categories ranging from near copy to substan-\ntial revision based on the number of unique links or strings of words.\nResearch in this area appears to concentrate more specifically on second language\n(L2) students rather than students per se (For a review see Cumming et al. 2016)\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 2 of 15\nalthough many native English writers may also lack the language skills to disseminate\nacademic discourse in their own voice (Bailey & Challen, 2015). Paraphrasing is a skill\nthat transcends the written form as it is ac tually a communication strategy required\nfor all language groups in interpersonal or intergroup interactions and includes oral\n(Rabab’ah, 2016) and visual forms (Chen et al. 2015a). Paraphrasing allows the same\nidea to be expressed in different ways as ap propriate for the intended audience. It can\nalso be used for persuasion (Suchan, 2014), explanations (Patil & Karekatti, 2015) and\nsupport (Bodie et al. 2016). In coaching, paraphrasing is used to ensure that the coach\nhas correctly understood what the coachee is saying, thus allowing the coachee to fur-\nther clarify their meaning (McCarthy, 2014).\nOnline writing tools\nThe prevalence and easy access to digital technologies and Internet-based sources have\nshifted “the way knowledge is constructed, shared and evaluated ” (Evering & Moorman,\n2012, p.36). However the quality, efficacy, validity and reliability of some Internet-based\nmaterial is questionable from an educational standpoint (Niño, 2009). Internet-based\nparaphrasing tools are text processing applications and associated with the same\napproaches used for machine translation (MT). While MT usually focusses on the\ntranslation of one language to another, th e broader consideration of text processing\ncan operate between or within langua ge corpuses (Ambati et al. 2010).\nInternet-based conversion and translation tools are easily accessible, and a number of\nversions are available to all without cost (Somers, 2012). Developments in the treat-\nment of translating natural language as a machine learning problem (known as statis-\ntical machine translation - SMT) are leading to continual improvements in this field\nalthough the linguistic accuracy varies based on the way each machine ‘learns’ (Lopez,\n2008). The free tools available via the Internet lack constant updates and improvements\nas the code is controlled by webmasters and not by experts in MT (Carter & Inkpen,\n2012). This means advances in methods and algorithms are not always available to indi-\nviduals relying on free Internet based tools. Consequently there are issues with the\nquality of MT which may require a level of post-editing to correct the raw output so\nthat it is fit for purpose (Inaba et al. 2007).\nPost-editing of an online output may be problematic or difficult for an individual with\na low level of proficiency in the language they are being taught or assessed in as gram-\nmatical inaccuracies and awkward phrasing cannot be easily identified and therefore\ncorrected (Niño, 2009). Where a student is considered to lack the necessary linguistic\nskills, the errors or inaccuracies may be interpreted by assessors as a student having a\npoor understanding of academic writing conventions rather than recognising that a\nstudent may not have written the work the mselves. Where an academic is working in\nan additional language, they may find the detection of the errors or inaccuracies more\ndifficult to identify.\nNor is the issue of paraphrasing or article spinning tool use confined to students.\nAutomated article spinners perform the same way as paraphrasing tools, where text is\nentered into one field with a ‘spun’ output provided on the same webpage. They were\ninitially developed for re-writing web content to maximise exposure and links to\nparticular sites, without being detected as a duplicate of original content (Madera et al.\n2014). The underlying purpose appears to allow website owners to “make money from\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 3 of 15\nthe new, but not strictly original, article ” (Lancaster & Clarke, 2009). These sites are\nfreely available to students leading to a new label covering the use of these tools as\n‘essay spinning ’ (Lancaster & Clarke, 2009, p.26). However, these spinning tools are\nequally available to academics who may be enticed with the notion of repurposing\nalready published content as a way of increasing research output.\nAlthough the quality levels of MT output varies widely, careful editing and review\ncan address the errors further disguising the original source material (Somers, 2012).\nRoig (2016) highlights that some forms of text recycling are normal in academic life\nsuch as converting conference presentations and theses to journal articles and the text-\nual reuse between editions of books, as long as there is appropriate acknowledgement\nof the original source. However Roig also points out that authors should be concerned\nabout reusing previous work as with technological advances it will not be long before\nall forms of academic written work can “be easily identified, retrieved, stored and\nprocessed in ways that are inconceivable at the present time ” (Roig, 2016, p.665).\nThe fact remains that taking another author ’s work, processing it through an online\nparaphrasing tool then submitting that work as ‘original’ is not original work where it\ninvolves the use of source texts and materials without acknowledgement. The case of a\nstudent submitting work generated by an online tool without appropriate acknowledge-\nm e n tc o u l db ec o n s i d e r e da saf o r mo fp l a g i arism, and the case of academics trying to\nreframe texts for alternate publicatio ns could be considered as a form of self-\nplagiarism. Both scenarios could be considered as ‘facilitated plagiarism ’ where an\nindividual actively seeks to use some form of easily accessible Internet-based source\nto prepare or supplement submission material for assessment by others (Granitz,\n2007; Scanlon & Neumann, 2002; Stamatatos, 2011). Applying technology to identify\nwhere the paraphrasing tools have been used is difficult as detection moves beyond\ntext summarisation and matching to comparison of meaning and evaluation of ma-\nchine translation (Socher et al. 2011).\nFurthermore, students using an online paraphrasing system fail to demonstrate their\nunderstanding of the assessment task and hence fail to provide evidence of achieving\nlearning outcomes. If they do not acknowledge the source of the text which they\nhave put through the paraphrasing tool, th ey are also guilty of academic misconduct.\nOn both counts, they would not merit a pass in the subject for which they submit\nsuch material.\nMethodology\nIn order to test the quality of output generated by some free Internet based paraphras-\ning tools and how the originality of the output is assessed by Turnitin®, the following\nexperiment was conducted. A paragraph from an existing publication by this article ’s\nauthors from a prior edition of the International Journal of Educations Integrity (IJEI)\nwas selected to be the original source material (McCarthy & Rogerson, 2009, p.49). To\nassess how a paraphrasing tool processes an in-text citation, one in-text citation was\nincluded (Thatcher, 2008). A set of three bibliographic entries from the reference list of\nthe same article were also selected to test how references are interpreted.\nAs students are more likely to use Google as the Internet search engine of choice and\nrely on results near the top of page (Spievak & Hayes-Bohanan, 2016), this approach\nwas used to identify and select some online paraphrasing tools for testing. The selected\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 4 of 15\nparagraph (including the in-text citation), and the selected references were entered into\nthe first two hits on a Google search on www.google.com.au for ‘paraphrasing tools ’.\nConsequently the sites used for the experi ment were www.paraphrasing-tool.com\n(Tool 1) and www.goparaphrase.com (Tool 2).\nThe next step was to compare the outputs from the original journal article material\nto the outputs of Tool 1 and Tool 2. Exact matches to the original text were observed,\ntagged and highlighted in grey. Matches between the two paraphrasing outputs that did\nnot match the original source were highlighted by placing the relevant text in a box.\nContractions and unusual matches were highlighted by double underlining the text.\nFor the first set of comparisons (paragraph with an in-text citation) the following\nsummary characteristics were calculated: total word counts, total word matches and\npercentage of similarity to the original paragraph.\nIn order to identify how Turnitin® interpreted the paragraph and bibliographic out-\nputs from the paraphrasing tools, the original source material and two paraphrasing\noutputs were uploaded to Turnitin® to check whether the journal publication could be\nidentified. Turnitin® comprises a suite of online educative writing and evaluation tools\nwhere assessment tasks can be uploaded, checked and assessed (www.turnitin.com). It\ncan be accessed via the Internet or through an interface with an institutional learning\nmanagement system (LMS). The originality checking area compares a submission\nagainst a range of previously published materials and a database of previously submit-\nted assignments. The system generates an originality report where text that matches\nclosely to a previously published or submitted source is highlighted by colour and num-\nber with links provided to publicly accessible materials. Matches to papers submitted at\nother institutions cannot be accessed without the express permission of the owning\ninstitution. As Baggaley and Spencer note (2005) Turnitin® originality reports require\ncareful analysis, for the reports identify text “which may or may not have been correctly\nattributed ” (Baggaley & Spencer, 2005, p. 56) and cannot be used as the sole deter-\nminant of whether or not a work is plagiarised or if source materials have been in-\nappropriately used (Rogerson, 2014).\nA separate Turnitin® assessment file was created for the experiment on an institu-\ntional academic integrity LMS site (Moodle) where a bank of dummy student profiles\nis available for testing purposes. Three dummy student accounts were used to load the\nindividual ‘outputs’ under two assignment parts. The uploads included one instance of\nthe source material in order to generate comparative originality reports for both the\nparagraph outputs (loaded under part 1) and the reference list outputs (loaded under\npart 2). For both sets of outputs the overa ll Turnitin® similarity percentages and\ndocument matches were reviewed for comparison purposes.\nResults\nThe highlighted comparisons of the paragraph outputs are presented in Fig. 1 (comparing\nTool 1) and Fig. 2 (comparing Tool 2). The summary characteristics for the paragraph\noutputs are presented in Table 1.\nThere are obvious differences in how the online paraphrasing tools have reengineered\nthe original work based on the number of identifiable matches between the original\nand output texts. For example there are differences in how words such as plagiarism\nare expressed (Original source: plagiarism; Tool 1: copyright infringement ; Tool 2:\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 5 of 15\ncounterfeit). Both tools have used additional words (Tool 1: additional five words; Tool\n2: additional 20 words). The output from Tool 1 has used 77 words or 50% of the\nwords in the original paragraph but these were predominately coordinating conjunc-\ntions. Tool 1 has followed the correct use of capitalisations in all words and sentences,\nhowever Tool 2 has not capitalised words such as English, and Chinese, but did capitalise\nseven random words mid-sentence ( Audit, Numerous, Concerning, Likewise, Taking, and\nWhat’s). In addition Tool 2 used contractions ( doesn’t)a n dt h ew o r d s ‘can have ’in the\noriginal have been reprocessed to ‘camwood’.\nThe highlighted comparisons of the reference section outputs are presented in Fig. 3\n(comparing the original source with Tool 1 and Tool 2). The summary characteristics\nof the Turnitin® results for the reference section outputs are presented in Table 2.\nThe Turnitin® results for both the paragraph and reference list uploads identified\nt h eo r i g i n a ls o u r c ea s1 0 0 %m a t c ht ot h eo n l i n el o c a t i o no ft h ej o u r n a ls u p p o r t i n g\nTurnitin’s® claim in relation to identifying legitimate academic resources. What is of\nconcern is Turnitin ’s® apparent inability to identify the similarities evident by a\nmanual comparison of the source and outputs. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the simi-\nlarities between the original source mate rials and the output of the tools yet the\nsimilarity percentages noted in Table 2 indi cate that the re-engineered paragraphs are\nnot detected. One of the current limitations of Turnitin® is that it can detect some\nbut not all cases of synonym replacement (Menai, 2012). Despite the patterned nature\nFig. 1 Comparison with output from www.paraphrasing-tool.com. Original source materials from McCarthy\nand Rogerson (2009, p.49) and citing Thatcher (2008)\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 6 of 15\nof the text matching identified through a visual examination of the output, the\nmachine-based originality similarity checking software continues to have limitations\nin identifying materials that appear to be plagiarised through the use of an online\nparaphrasing tool or language translation application.\nTurnitin® was more successful in matching up bibliographic data to the original\nsource. This was likely due to the fact that the paraphrasing tools did not alter (or\nbarely altered) long strings of numbers, letters and website URLs. The higher Turnitin®\nmatch to the output from Tool 1 (72% similarity) was due to the retention of most of\nthe journal name ( International replaced with Global) however the author name ‘Crisp’\nFig. 2 Comparison with www.goparaphrase.com. Original source materials from McCarthy and Rogerson\n(2009, p.49) and citing Thatcher (2008)\nTable 1 Comparison of paragraph elements\nSource Total words Words the same as\noriginal paragraph\nPercentage of word similarity\nto original paragraph\nOriginal paper 153\nTool 1 158 77 50%\nTool 2 173 46 30%\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 7 of 15\nwas altered to ‘Fresh’. The output from Tool 2 retained the authors ’last names, but added\nin 11 additional words to replace author Dahl ’sf i r s ti n i t i a lo f‘S’which would have affected\nthe calculation of similarity percentage. It is interesting that the change to lower case for\nauthors’initials appeared to impact on Turnitin ’s® capacity to identify the authors in the\nfirst reference and missed the end of the journal details in the third reference, which also\nwould have contributed to the lower similarity percentage. This led to Turnitin® over-\nlooking 15 word matches and 13 other number and character matches in the Tool 2\nsubmission that were identified as direct matches in the Tool 1 output.\nFig. 3 Comparison with three reference list entries.

For\nexample both tools retained [ ,p o l i c e d ,], and the name and intext citation [Thatcher\n(2008)] in the paragraph comparison, and a string in the reference section compari-\nson [ Integrity, 3, 3 – 15, from http://www.]. Without knowing the algorithms for the\nparaphrasing tools or Turnitin®, pattern ss u c ha st h e s ec a no n l y be observed rather\nthan analysed.\nDiscussion\nThe outputs and comparisons presented in Figs. 1 and 2 appear more like patchwriting\nrather than paraphrasing. Li and Casanave (2012) argue that patchwriting is an indica-\ntion that the student is a novice writer still learning how to write and understand the\n“complexities of appropriate textual borrowing ” (Li & Casanave, 2012, p.177) although\ntheir study was confined to L2 students submitting assessment material in English.\nThey further argue that deeming text as patchwriting does not attract the same nega-\ntive connotations of plagiarism nor would it attract the same penalties. In our examples\nthe patterns of text, language and phrasing can identify a student requiring learning\nsupport. This determination is likely due to the presence of poor expression, gram-\nmatical errors and areas of confused meaning which are sometimes referred to as a\n‘word salad ’. The term word salad is drawn from psychology but has been adopted in\nareas such as MT to classify unintelligible and random collections of words and\nphrases (Definition:word salad, 2016). Word salads are produced by MT “when\ntranslation engines fail to do a c omplete analysis of their input ” (Callison-Burch &\nFlournoy, 2001, p.1).\nWhile the output from Tool 1 is mainly intelligible, some of the results from Tool 2\ncould be classified as word salads, for example in the last line the following string of\nwords was produced ‘duplicating Likewise an approach about Taking in starting with\nWhat's more paying admiration to previous aces ’. If an unintelligible string of words\nwas submitted as part of an assessment task it may be a reason to have a conversation\nwith a student to understand how they are going about their writing, and to determine\nif paraphrasing tools or article spinners have contributed. Where a citation is provided,\nit may be a case of a student having a poor understanding of academic writing\nconventions. Where there is no citation or any reference to the original source the\nsituation may warrant investigation under a cademic integrity institutional policies\nand procedures.\nIf the percentage calculations presented in Fig. 1 are compared with Kecks (2006)\nTaxonomy of Paraphrase Types , the outputs from the online tools would fall into the\ncategory of paraphrases with minimal revision when compared to the original text\n(Keck, 2014, p.9). The manual comparison of documents in this experiment indicates a\nlevel of patchwriting, however Turnitin® could not establish a relationship between the\noriginal source paragraph and the machine generated paraphrasing-tool outputs. It is\nmore akin to some of the plagiarism behaviours described by Walker (1998, p.103) such\nas “illicit paraphrasing ” where material is reused without any source acknowledgement\nor even “sham paraphrasing ” where text is directly cop ied but includes a source\nacknowledgement. This is a cause for conc ern as the comparison with the online\nparaphrasing tool output was only possible as the original source was known. It is\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 9 of 15\nnot just a question of percentages but in th e patterns clearly visible in Figs. 1, 2 and\n3. Consequently, this set of experiments i ndicates a level of similarity that is con-\ncerning in two key areas, firstly where the original source is not acknowledged or\nidentifiable, and secondly if this level o f similarity were found in student work, it\nwould suggest that the student may not have understood the material, or at least that\nhe/she has not demonstrat ed their understanding.\nManual analysis and academic judgement are integral parts of the process of detec-\ntion of plagiarised materials (Bretag & Mahmud, 2009b), and are heavily reliant on the\nlevel of experience an assessor has in identifying clues, markers and textual patterns\n(Rogerson & Bassanta, 2016). In this experiment the original source of the plagiarised\nmaterials would be difficult to identify, however the presence of clues and patterns may be\nsufficient to motivate a lecturer or tutor to initiate an initial conversation with a student\nto determine whether the work is actually the student ’s own (Somers et al. 2006).\nA further investigation of the results from the Google search on ‘paraphrasing tools ’\nidentified that many of the sites have multiple public faces — that is that there are\nadditional URLs that direct users back to the same paraphrasing machine. The purpose\nbehind the existence of the sites is not clear. The sites do carry Internet advertising so\ntheir existence and multiple faces may be related to a way to generate income. Alarm-\ningly the sites examined in this study showed advertisements for higher education insti-\ntutions which could be misinterpreted by users as tacit approval for the sites and their\noutput. Other sites highlight that rudimentary paraphrasing tools are highly inaccurate\nbut promote their paid services to correct the output — i.e. a process that could be inter-\npreted as another form of contracted plagiarism (Clarke & Lancaster, 2013).\nOne of the questions that arises in assessing work as plagiarised is associated with\nintentionality— that is, did the person intend to deceive another about the originality of\nwork (Lee, 2016). In the case of students “it is the inappropriate research and writing\npractices and the resulting misappropriate or misuse of information that leads students\nto breach academic integrity expectations ” (Pfannenstiel, 2010, p.43). Pfannenstiel ’s use\nof the word ‘expectations’is both interesting and enlightening as it is probable that dif-\nferences in expectations is what is at the crux of the issue with online paraphrasing or\narticle spinning tools. Expectations can be influenced by cultural and educational back-\ngrounds, a lack of understanding or skills in paraphrasing and linguistic and language\nresources (Cumming et al., 2016; Sun, 2012). For example: a student may sincerely\nbelieve that as they have not submitted an exact copy of the original source, and that\nthere is no evidence of match to the original source via online originality checking soft-\nware that they have met the objective of submitting original work. Conversely, an\nacademic may reasonably consider this to be direct plagiarism as the student copied the\noriginal work of someone else and reused it without any acknowledgement (Davis &\nMorley, 2015). This area of confusion was noted in Shi ’s (2012) study where a student\nstated that using a translation of an original text did not require acknowledgment of the\noriginal source as the translation was not directly the original source. (Shi, 2012, p.140).\nWhile Turnitin® cannot currently connect the writing and the paraphrases in this ex-\nperiment, it and other MT tools are in a constant state of evolution and their ability to\nidentify poor quality machine translated text will continue to improve over time (Carter\n& Inkpen, 2012). In order to test the progress, Carter and Inkpen (2012) suggest that\nmultiple tests of the same piece of text be conducted over a period of years to measure\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 10 of 15\nboth the quality of output and the ability to detect their use. The literature reviewed in\nthis area focusses on the detection of phrases and sentences, with Socher et al. (2011)\nnoting that once detection switches from phrases to full sentences a comparison of\nmeaning is more difficult for a machine to learn.\nThis article does not attempt to outline all the work being undertaken in this area,\ninstead it highlights that there is research being undertaken to develop and further en-\nhance MT (encoding and decoding) and detection of MT use. This includes computers\nlearning computational semantics and managing expanded vocabularies to move be-\nyond recognition of specific tasks (Kiros et al., 2015). Turnitin® ’s ability to match large\nsections of text outside of their own repository of previously submitted assessment\ntasks is very useful because the majority of academic materials that can be plagiarised\nare text based (Bretag & Mahmud, 2009a). Using text-matching as a basis for detection\ninstead of semantic matching means that uses of online paraphrasing tools and article\nspinners continues to be difficult for tec hnology to detect at this time. Therefore\nfor the foreseeable future the onus of detection of unoriginal material remains with\nacademics, lecturers and teachers (Rogerson, 2014).\nFurther confusion arises when institutions develop computer based paraphrasing\ntools as a way of developing English language writing skills for L2 students. Aware of\nthe difficulties that L2 learners have with paraphrasing tasks, Chen, Huang, Chang and\nLiou developed a web and corpus based ‘paraphrasing assistant system ’ designed to\nsuggest paraphrases with corresponding Chinese translations (Chen et al. 2015b, p.23).\nStudents familiar with using such a system in their home country may seek similar\nassistance if studying abroad. Without access to an approved technology they may\nseek to discover similar assistance tools on the Internet — where they can easily locate\nthe paraphrasing tools identified in this experiment. These same students may also\nlack the judgement skills to discern the di fference between the output from approved\nand poor quality online tools whether they ar e paraphrasing tools, article spinners or\nlanguage translators.\nImplications for practice: working with students\nOne way of confronting or approaching this issue is to openly demonstrate to students\nthe errors and inaccuracies that can result in using online tools (Niño, 2009). Commu-\nnicating proactively about the issue provides students with a greater awareness of the\nproblems that can result from using online paraphrasing sites as well as ensuring that\nstudents understand that they should not expect to graduate unless they can demon-\nstrate they understand the course material. Their current and future employers have\nthe right to expect that for example, a student graduating with a degree in marketing\nwill be able to articulate their understanding of marketing concepts. Proactive approaches\ncan also promote learning development and support services offered by the educational\ninstitution providing students with advice about paraphrasing and strategies for improving\ntheir writing skills and therefore avoiding problematic practices. This educates students\nabout alternatives to using online machine text generation tools.\nSome students have expressed concerns that other students will continue to take\nadvantage of technology based aids even though they had been told not to use them\nand knowing that to do so could be classified as cheating (Burnett et al. 2016). Students\nwho do not cheat but put in the effort themselves are usually outraged if fellow\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 11 of 15\nstudents get away with cheating and may even bring cases they notice to the institu-\ntions’ attention (Warnock, 2006). This was the case with the casual comment by the\nstudent who brought the online paraphrasing tools to our attention. The actions of our\nstudents working with their group member to develop their own work also demon-\nstrates how honest students can be allies in upholding the academic standards of the\ninstitution (Bretag & Mahmud, 2016). If the benefits of learning and developing indi-\nvidual paraphrasing skills are linked to the broader benefits of effective interpersonal\nand intergroup communication, the open approach to confronting and discussing the\nissue may be more successful.\nImplications for practice: working with staff\nThe development of reading, summarising and paraphrasing skills are not the sole re-\nsponsibility of learning developers. Educators need to embed academic skills in lectures\nand tutorials and provide feedback on student progress measured through effective\nassessment (Sambell et al. 2013). Clear assessment requirements and use of rubrics\nindicate the importance and differences to grades for the various levels of academic\nskills (Atkinson & Lim, 2013) providing students with a reason to develop their skills.\nEffective feedback assists students in identifying where they have achieved certain levels\nof academic skills and which skills require further development (Evans, 2013).\nA further approach to tackling the issue is to re-design assessment tasks to include\nan oral component where the student has to present a summary of their argument and\nanswer questions. This approach can ensure that the student understands and has\nachieved the learning outcomes, although it is no guarantee of the student ’s academic\nintegrity in preparing for their presentation. Finally, academics can also be trained to\nlook for linguistic markers indicating the possibility of the use of such online para-\nphrasing tools so that they can investigate cases appropriately. Such markers include\nsentences that do not make sense, odd use of capitalisations in the middle of sentences,\nunusual phrases and, in the case where students have reprocessed work from old\ntextbooks, out of date and superseded reference material.\nConclusion and recommendations for further research\nThis study has demonstrated that students can use online paraphrasing tools or article\nspinners in ways that avoid detection by originality checking software such as Turnitin®.\nWhether or not it is the student ’s intent to avoid plagiarism is not the issue examined\nhere. Rather, the intent of this paper is to ensure that those involved in teaching and\nlearning are aware of the practice, can detect its use and initiate meaningful conversa-\ntions with students about the perils of using such tools. There is a fine line between\nuse of paraphrasing tools and the use of tools to plagiarise, however it is only through\nopen discussion that students will learn to appreciate the benefits of articulating their\nunderstanding in their own words with the appropriate acknowledgement of sources.\nParaphrasing is a skill that transcends an ability to interpret and restate an idea or\nconcept in writing. It is an important skill that needs to be introduced and developed\nin terms of written, visual and oral forms. The capacity of students and academics to\nrephrase, frame and restate the ideas and intentions of original authors themselves\nwith appropriate acknowledgements of sources is fundamental to the principles of\nacademic integrity and personal development. The proliferation of fee-based and free\nRogerson and McCarthy International Journal for Educational Integrity  (2017) 13:2 Page 12 of 15\nInternet-based tools designed to re-engineer text is a concern. Of greater concern is\nthat tools contracted to identify original source materials cannot necessarily be used\nat this time to identify where writing has b een repurposed. Regardless of the ease of\naccess to online text regeneration tools and the work being done to try to electronic-\nally detect their use, individuals should be encouraged to improve their own para-\nphrasing expertise as an essential part of individual skill development in and beyond\neducational institutions.\nFurther work is needed to identify linguistic markers indicating use of online para-\nphrasing tools such as those identified in this study. Academics are already time poor\nand while they may be strongly in favour of upholding academic standards, they may\nalso be reluctant to undertake time-consuming investigations into possible misconduct.\nThey need encouragement to integrate the observation of textual patterns and markers\ninto their grading and assessment practice. Research is also needed in exploring the\nmost effective techniques or combination of educational, deterrent and punitive tech-\nniques and machine detection tools to combat the use of online paraphrasing tools and\narticle spinners and other forms of academic malpractice. Such developments will assist\nin directing the focus of writing efforts back to where it should be – which is individuals\nwriting and submitting their own work with appropriate acknowledgements.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback on the original version\nof this manuscript.\nAuthors’ contributions\nAR 80%.
