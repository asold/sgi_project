INTRODUCTION \n \nDuring the machining processes such as turning or milling, where hard material is removed, the wear of the \ncutting tool reduces considerably the quality of the workpiece. In spite of actual technology to estimate the \nwear of the cutting tool, the manufacturing industry still uses mainly empirical methods to evaluate the tool \nlife, for example the number of machining hours. Figure 1 shows a machining process using a rotating four-\nflank cutting tool, which is the type of tool profile considered in this work. The feed motion is generated by \nthe worktable driven by linear stages; the rotation of the tool is produced by the main spindle, usually an \nAC motor controlled in velocity. The speed rotation and the feed rate depend on the workpiece material and \nthe depth of cut. One can observe that for a given instant only one flank is in contact with the material. If \none contact flank is worn the next cutting f lank should remove also the surplus material from the previous \n \nOn-Line wear detection of milling tools a displacement fiber optic sensor, E. Catillo-Castañeda, 164-174 \n \n165 \nJournal of Applied Research and Technology  \n \none, then at this moment the cutting force increases. Because of this fact, the first technique to detect the \ntool wear was done using a force sensor. \n \n  \nFigure 1. Tool motion during cutting \n \nSince many years, in most of manufacturing industries, tool life has been estimated as a number of \nmachining hours. When this empirical number expires, the tool has to be removed whether or not it is still in \ngood conditions. Evidently, this empirical method is only suitable when the tool is used in exactly the same \ncutting conditions during all its life and the work piece material is  sufficiently homogeneous to ensure a \nsimilar wear for a similar machining time. In very few cases, tool wear is verified by off-line methods, by \nhuman visual inspection, to decide if it is still in good conditions for machining. In any case, the best way to \nensure the quality of a final machining is to guarantee that the tool wear remains within a predefined range, \nif this range is surpassed the tool must be immediately changed by a new one. Figure 2 shows the milling \ntool geometry considered for this work. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Milling tool geometry \n \nSome techniques have been already developed for on -line moni toring for detecting tool wear or tool \nbreakage. The most common method is the spindle current monitoring. As it was stated before, when one \nflank of the cutting tool is worn, the next flank should remove the surplus material, then the cutting force \nincreases, producing an increment of the spindle current. When the spindle current exceeds a predefined \nset point, the machining process is automatically stopped, sending a message to the operator to check the \nwhole system or to replace the tool. This method is mainly used for tool breakage because in such case the \nspindle current variation becomes more evident. A second method that has been already used with \nsuccess by several industries is to monitor the acoustic emission signal produced  during the cutting  \nprocess [1]. In a similar way that the previous method, when the signal reaches predefined limits, the \ncutting process is stopped. The work performed at Technical University of Warsaw presented in [2] shows \n \nOn-Line wear detection of milling tools a displacement fiber optic sensor, E. Catillo-Castañeda, 164-174 \n \n \n166 \nVol. 1 No. 2 July 2003 \n \na technique to detect the tool failure by using a sta tistical analysis of the acoustic emission signal. At the \nTechnical University of Chemnitz, Germany, the acoustic emission signal method has been also used to \nestimate the quality of the machined surface during turning processes [3], that is an alternative  method to \nestimate also the roughness of the workpiece. At the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Tsukuba, \nJapan, an application of the Wavelet transform was developed for on-line detection of tool breakage during \nmachining process [4]. In that case, th e monitored signal was the cutting force sensed at the worktable \nlevel. The work reported in [5], performed at the University of Paderborn, Germany, presents a multisensor \nsystem based on neural nets for monitoring several correlated variables of a turning  process to evaluate \nthe tool condition.  \n \nThe common strategy of all the previous works has been the implementation of indirect methods  to \nestimate the tool condition based on the monitoring of physical signals that are correlated with the tool wear \nor breakage, such as the spindle current, acoustic emission, and cutting force. Thus, the main problem is to \nfind a correlation function between one of those signals and tool wear or breakage. The reliability of the \nrelationship between indirect measurements an d the tool condition is a serious problem to be overcome \nwhen several cross-correlated variables influence the condition of the tool. As a result of this, the work in \n[6] proposes a monitoring method based on both cutting forces monitoring and flank wear m easurements \nusing a vision system [7 -9]. Based on experimental analysis, a flank wear curve is estimated by giving a \nprediction of the tool-life. A review of indirect methods for tool wear monitoring is presented in [10]. \n \nFollowing the idea of an in-process direct monitoring, Dr. Ryabov from Mechanical Engineering Laboratory \nin Tsukuba, Japan, presents in [11] a method f or detecting tool failures by using a laser sensor. However, \nas it´s well known light reflected from laser sensors can produce eye damage. \n \nThe work presented in this paper proposes a direct method for on -line tool condition monitoring while the \ntool is rotating. It is being carried out at the Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro, Mexico. The main \ncontribution is to propose an innovative direct  method, based on a displacement fiber optic sensor \n(photonic sensor) for monitoring the tool wear in real time with an accuracy less than one micron. \n \n2. THE DISPLACEMENT FOTONIC SENSOR \n \n2.1 The fiber sensor \n \nThe recent growth of activity in fiber optic s ensors has lead to a great variety of technically sophisticated \ndevices employing interference, polarization, and wavelength modulation techniques [12]. In spite of all, \nthese methods offer great promise to certain specific applications and dedicated senso rs, the intensity \nmodulated Fiber Optic Displacement Sensor offers a powerful combination of simplicity, performance, \nversatility, and low cost, which make it well suited for a wide variety of laboratory and industrial \napplications. Moreover, since the lig ht emitted by this type of sensor comes from a photodiode it does not \nproduce eye damage, then it is safer than laser displacement sensors. \n \n2.2 Parameter analysis \n \nThe basic principle employed in the Fiber Optic Lever Displacement Transducer [13] is to us e two sets of \nfiber optic elements, one to carry light from a remote source to an object or target whose displacement or \nmotion is to be measured, and the other to receive the light reflected from the object and carry it back to a \nphoto sensitive detector.  A very common fiber optic probe is a bifurcated bundle fiber [14], as shown in \nFigure 3. \n \n \nOn-Line wear detection of milling tools a displacement fiber optic sensor, E. Catillo-Castañeda, 164-174 \n \n167 \nJournal of Applied Research and Technology  \n \n  \nFigure 3. Bifurcated bundle fiber \n \nThe light emitted from one bundle is back-reflected by the target and collected by another bundle (receiving \nfibers). As a result, the returned light at the detector is distance-modulated.  The mathematical analysis of a \nphotonic sensor is considerably simplified by the assumption that uni-angular electro luminescent energy is \ncoupled into loss -less, non -dispersing, and otherwise ideal step -index fibers with negligible cladding \nthickness. Further simplification results when the sensor consists of a single centered transmitting fiber \nsurrounded by six symmetrical receiving fibers (radius equal to 0r ) as shown in Figure 4. This figure shows \nthe exit and reflected patterns at the exit/return plane. The area of receiving fibers illuminated by reflected \nlight (reflected ring radius x ) is proportional to the target distance y  (standoff distance). The distance dx  \nrepresents x  variations when distance from probe to target varies  ( dy). The characteristic parameters \nassociated to this sensor can be determined from the knowledge of: the angle f  and the emittance level of \nthe exit illumination, the geometric relationships between transmitting and receiving fibers, and the distance  \nfrom-fiber-tip-to-target.\n \n Figure 4. Cross section of the sensor \n \n \nOn-Line wear detection of milling tools a displacement fiber optic sensor, E. Catillo-Castañeda, 164-174 \n \n \n168 \nVol. 1 No. 2 July 2003 \n \nThe mathematical relationships of the displacement sensor, such as: the geometric sensitivity, the \ndisplacement sensitivity, the optical detection limit, and the displacement detection limit, will be derived in \nthe next section. In this work, the sensitivity was defined as the rate of change of the standoff distance due \nto a change in a parameter. \n \nThe geometric sensitivity ( Ga ) is defined as the relationship between the standoff distance variations and \nthe distance-modulated area of reflected light on the fiber termination plane, i.e., dA\ndy\nG =a  \nFrom trigonometry, it is a function of the fiber radius and illumination exit angle only. When fiber cladding is \nnegligible, the standoff distance is given by \n \nftan2\n0rxy −=                                                                            (1) \n \n By defining a parameter 0/ rxq = , the equation (1) can be rewritten as \n \n( )\nftan2\n1 0rqy −=                                                                          (2) \n \nThe distance-modulated area of the reflected ring on the fiber termination plane is given by xdxdA p2= . \nThe first derivative of equation (2) respect to this area is given by:  \n \ndA\ndx\ndA\ndy\nftan2\n1=                                                                      (3) \n \nThen the Ga  referred to this plane is \n \nfp tan4\n1\nxdA\ndy =                                                                      (4) \n \nThe displacement sensitivity ( Da ) of a fiber optic sensor is determined by the manner in which the optical \nradiometric power ( ORp ) reaching the photo-detector varies with the target distance, i.e., \nOR\nD dp\ndy=a  \nThe nonlinear contributions of the Da  are incorporated into a term ORpddqs ~/~ = , where \nmax\n~\np\npp OR\nOR = . maxp  is \nthe maximum subtended power. The differentiation of this term and equation (4) lead to: \n \nfa tan2\n~\nmax\n0\np\nrs\nD =                                                                     (5) \n \nThe subtended power of the receiving fibers is the product of the receiving fiber subtended area and the \nirradiance. Figure 5 shows the interaction of three adjacent transmitting and receiving fiber s as the light is \nreflected from a target a the single angle f . It can be seen that a zero gap, the light in the transmitting fiber \nwould be reflected directly back into itself and little or no light would be transferred to the receiving fiber. As \nthe gap increases, some of the reflected light is captured by the receiving fiber and carried to the photo \nsensitive detector. As the gap increases, a distance will be reached at which a maximum of reflected light is \ntransferred to the receiv ing fiber. Further increases in the gap will result in a decrease in the light at the \nreceiving fiber face and a corresponding drop in the output signal from the photo sensor. The gap and \ndisplacement range over which the initial rise in signal takes place  and at which the maximum occurs is \nprimarily determined by the diameter and the numerical aperture of the fibers and the intensity distribution \nwithin the operating field of the fibers. In order to obtain the higher levels of intensity at the photo detectors, \n \nOn-Line wear detection of milling tools a displacement fiber optic sensor, E. Catillo-Castañeda, 164-174 \n \n169 \nJournal of Applied Research and Technology  \n \ncommercial devices of this type uses multiple transmitting and receiving fibers. The irradiance of the target-\nreflected illumination on the entrance plane of the receiving fibers may be derived from the geometry \nshown in Figure 5. Indeed, since all ra ys are meridional and uniformly distributed within the illuminated \nfiber, they exit at the single angle f . Figure 5 shows that two different irradiances appear on a target \nlocated on plane B, a uniformly bright spot surrounded by a uniformly annular ring portion. When the target \ndistance reaches the C plane the bright spot disappears and an annular ring appears (from C plane to \ntarget plane). The width of this annular ring is equal to the fiber diameter. \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Interaction between transmitting and receiving fibers \n \nThese two irradiances appear from zero to plane C. Figure 6 shows more clearly that patterns of reflected \nlight on B and C planes are annular rings, diverging cone, and not uniformly illuminated disks since the rays \nexit the illuminating fiber are not perpendicular to those planes. \n \n \n \n \n Figure 6.

Instead of a high cost laser \ndisplacement sensor, this simple and low cost fiber optic sensor performs good quality measurements of \nthe tool wear. The direct method developed has the ability to “reconstruct” the tool profile after only on e \ntour of the tool, then it provides a very fast and accurate on -line method. In order to protect  the sensor \nfrom sharp strips of metal, compressed air can be blown by a nozzle located near the sensor. The sensor \nresponse curve varies depending on the typ e of material of target surface, thus it has to be calibrated for \neach tool material. This technique can also be used in many other situations of on -line detection failures \nsuch as automatic crack detection of metal sheets.  \n \n6.
