  "abstract": "This article contemplates and advocates for the use of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) through Large Language Models (“LLM”) in legal practice. The author ultimately addresses the need to orient LMMs within varying legal contexts including academia, private practice, as well as the U.S. court system. Additionally, the author emphasizes the inevitability of AI and LLM systems infiltrating legal practice, and the reality that the industry must acknowledge and accept these systems to regulate and to provide better while still ethical legal services. Large Language Models: AI’s Legal Revolution, begins by walking the reader through the history of technological innovation of AI, all the way to modern LLM systems. This in turn lays a foundation for understanding what exactly the product is that should shape the legal landscape, and why we should be paying better attention to it. The article then compares and contrasts the current LLM products on the market, including a discussion of their capabilities in the context of legal work. Finally, the article discusses the different practical areas of law where LLMs can prove to enhance the legal industry, how so, and the benefits that LLMs may bring to the landscape of law in the twenty-first century.",
