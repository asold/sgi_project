  "abstract": "Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a cornerstone of academic research,\\nyet they are often labour-intensive and time-consuming due to the detailed\\nliterature curation process. The advent of generative AI and large language\\nmodels (LLMs) promises to revolutionize this process by assisting researchers\\nin several tedious tasks, one of them being the generation of effective Boolean\\nqueries that will select the publications to consider including in a review.\\nThis paper presents an extensive study of Boolean query generation using LLMs\\nfor systematic reviews, reproducing and extending the work of Wang et al. and\\nAlaniz et al. Our study investigates the replicability and reliability of\\nresults achieved using ChatGPT and compares its performance with open-source\\nalternatives like Mistral and Zephyr to provide a more comprehensive analysis\\nof LLMs for query generation.\\n Therefore, we implemented a pipeline, which automatically creates a Boolean\\nquery for a given review topic by using a previously defined LLM, retrieves all\\ndocuments for this query from the PubMed database and then evaluates the\\nresults. With this pipeline we first assess whether the results obtained using\\nChatGPT for query generation are reproducible and consistent. We then\\ngeneralize our results by analyzing and evaluating open-source models and\\nevaluating their efficacy in generating Boolean queries.\\n Finally, we conduct a failure analysis to identify and discuss the\\nlimitations and shortcomings of using LLMs for Boolean query generation. This\\nexamination helps to understand the gaps and potential areas for improvement in\\nthe application of LLMs to information retrieval tasks. Our findings highlight\\nthe strengths, limitations, and potential of LLMs in the domain of information\\nretrieval and literature review automation.\\n",
