INTRODUCTION\nThe power transformer is the heart of the electric power sys-\ntem due to vast applicabilities in the generation, transmission,\nand distribution levels. The reliable and efﬁcient operation of\nthe electrical power transformer signiﬁcantly depends on its\ninsulation characteristics, as it constitutes the major portion\nof the transformer failure. The insulating oil plays a crucial\nrole in the power transformer lifespan as it performs both\nthe insulation as well as the coolant functionality [1]. The\nelectrical power transformers during its operating life are\nexposed to a variety of stresses, such as mechanical, thermal,\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Nagarajan Raghavan\n.\nelectrical, and environmental stresses. The advancement in\npower transformer comprises the objective of better electri-\ncal and thermal insulation with minimum liquid insulation\nquantity to diminish the transformer size [2]. The insulating\nmaterial must be able to withstand different stresses to prevent\nshort circuits and leakage currents. The conventional insulat-\ning oils are incapable to fulﬁll the compactness requirement\nand face many faults with growing stresses. Therefore, new\nliquid insulation or some additional supporting reagents are\nrequired with conventional oil should be developed to meet all\ndemands of the futuristic power transformer. Consequently,\nthe evolution of nanotechnology in the power area is an\nessential step towards improvement in liquid dielectrics [3].\nNanotechnology is ﬂourishing rapidly due to the demand\n163316 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Hussainet al.: Dielectric Performance of Magneto-NFs for Advancing Oil-Immersed Power Transformer\nfor improved quality of insulating oil and has become an\nimportant part of the research.\nThe word ‘Nanoﬂuid’ was coined by Dr. Stephen Choi in\nthe year 1993, where the nano-scaled sized particles-based\ncoolant was prepared for achieving improved stability and\nthermal conductivity [4], [5]. Nanoﬂuids (NFs) are described\nas the colloidal suspension of nanoparticles (NPs) with the\nsize between 1 to 100 nm evenly dispersed in the insulat-\ning medium which can be created either by chemical or\nphysical processes [6]. It has anomalous physical, and ther-\nmal transport properties. The small size of particles support\nto deliver a stable suspension, better thermal conductivity,\nreduced physical erosion, and lower pumping power. The\naddition of a very little amount of NPs into the insulating\nmedium shows a noteworthy alteration in the electrical and\nthermal properties [7]. The improvement due to NPs relies on\nthe numerous physical, chemical, and thermal characteristics\nof NPs along with the base medium. The enhanced heat\ntransfer capability and electrical property have resulted in\nthe exploration of NFs to a vast extent, especially as the\nalternative for transformer oil.\nMagneto-Nanoﬂuids (ferroﬂuids) contain evenly dis-\ntributed NPs-based ﬂuid which use magnetic NPs to\nachieve superior dielectric property for transformer oil [8].\nRecently, many types of research have been carried out on\nmagneto-NFs that show promising dielectric and thermal\nproperties as transformer oil [9]–[11]. Lv et al.[9] proposed\nthe magnetic NFs suitable for high voltage insulation by\nverifying improved dielectric strength with NP concentration.\nRaﬁq et al. [10] illustrated an improvement with ac and\nimpulse breakdown strength on magnetic NFs with mineral\noil as the base ﬂuid. While Kim and Lee [11], carried out\nexperiments on the breakdown strength of mineral oil-based\nferroﬂuids under the effect of the magnetic ﬁeld displaying\npromising results in high voltage applications. The improved\nthermal and electrical properties of magnetic NFs in trans-\nformer windings also elevate the switching and lightning\nimpulse withstand capability of power transformer with the\ninsigniﬁcant impact of the moisture [12].\nSeveral research papers in the breakdown of NFs have been\npublished in the present years. Danikas et al.[13] performed\nsome experimental work related to the breakdown charac-\nteristics of natural ester oil and mineral oil. The breakdown\nvoltages of prepared NFs have been observed to be higher\nwhen compared to the host oil. Table 1 shows different com-\nmercially available liquid insulating materials used in power\ntransformers which are categorized into three main types:\nmineral insulating oil, synthetic insulating oil, and vegetable\ninsulating oil [14].\nSome of the works have been performed in the past regard-\ning the temperature affecting the NFs [15], [16]. In [15],\nthe authors performed the experimental analysis on the A.C\nbreakdown characteristics of host oil and ZrO 2-based NFs\nconsidering the effect of temperature. The results carried out\nduring this process were positive, as the higher breakdown\nstrength of NFs compared to host oil at higher temperatures\nTABLE 1. Types of insulating oil [14].\nwas evident. The reason for the increase in the breakdown\nvoltage for any ﬂuid is due to the reduction in the relative\nhumidity of oil. For NFs, NPs in the NF have the ability to\nabsorb moisture from the surrounding due to induced relative\ninterfacial polarization creating more robust ﬂuid than host\noil [16].\nWhile synthesizing the NFs, the stability of NF is a sig-\nniﬁcant requirement to attain a longer lifespan [17]. The\nstability of NFs implies the consistent dispersion of NPs in\nthe insulating oil and restrict any settlement or coagulation\nof NPs during its operating life [18]. The force of attraction\namong NPs creates particle clusters that later deposit down\ndue to higher density [19]. Therefore, short term stability due\nto the increasing size of clusters is the obstacle for any NFs\nto be utilized in practical applications [9]. The limitation can\nbe overcome with the help of stabilizing agents known as\nsurfactants which vary depending on the NPs, base liquid, and\napplications [19].\nThe main contribution of this article is to illustrate\nthe dielectric performance of the novel iron phosphide\nNPs-based NF along with cobalt (II, III) oxide and iron\n(II, III) oxide-based NF. The effectiveness of the prepared\nmagneto-NFs is determined by the dielectric characteristics\nand breakdown strength measurement. The determined per-\nformance provides the NF applicability as a conventional\ntransformer oil replacement. All these characteristics of the\nprepared NFs and other NFs have been investigated and\ndiscussed. Further, statistical analysis is presented to examine\nthe breakdown probability by the Weibull Distribution regres-\nsion analysis.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The experimental work\non the dielectric strength of NFs is detailed in Section II. The\nobtained results of prepared NFs along with the discussion\nis presented in Section III. The conclusion is provided in\nSection IV. Section V gives a comprehensive overview of\nNFs and its characteristic properties.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 163317\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Dielectric Performance of Magneto-NFs for Advancing Oil-Immersed Power Transformer\nII. EXPERIMENTAL WORK\nTo validate the theoretical analysis, a series of experiments\nwere conducted to ﬁnd the potential of NFs. Firstly, the\nNPs and dielectric ﬂuids are selected to prepare the NFs\nbased on their properties. The breakdown voltage (BDV) tests\nare performed for each prepared NFs having different NP\nconcentrations through oil breakdown voltage tester. Further,\nthe relative permittivity of each prepared NFs is measured by\nthe dielectric constant kit. Step by step experimental work is\ndetailed as follows:\nA. MATERIALS USED\nThe magnetic NPs picked for the experimental work are\niron phosphide (Fe 3P), cobalt (II, III) oxide, and iron (II, III)\noxide. Cobalt (II, III) oxide and iron (II, III) oxide nanopar-\nticles were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Whereas, are\niron phosphide (Fe 3P) microparticles was purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich and further synthesized by top-down nan-\notechnology approach to form nanopowder [20]. Dielectric\nﬂuids taken in the experiment are commercially accessible\nsynthetic ester oil and natural ester oil. For stabilizing the NPs\noleic acid is used.\nB. PREPARATION\nBased on the number of steps, NFs can be manufactured\neither in a one-step or two-step method [21]. One-step method\ninvolves the dispersion and synthesis of NPs that are simul-\ntaneous, i.e., the processes of drying, storing, and transfer-\nence are not practiced and, therefore, results in enhancement\nand minimization of agglomeration of stable nano-based oil.\nWhile two-step process comprises a two-phase method i.e.,\nsynthesizing the nanoﬁllers followed by the dispersing of\nthe nanoﬁllers into the host ﬂuid by utilizing mechanical\nor thermal techniques (such as mechanical agitation, ultra-\nsonication, and magnetic stirring).\nThe two-step technique reduces the probability of clusters\npertaining due to the force of attraction between the NPs,\nwhich causes the settling of NPs. However, the coagulation\nof the NPs could not be completely eliminated without using\nsurfactants. The magnetic NPs are efﬁciently coated with\noleic acid as a surfactant with oil as a base medium to provide\nbetter stability in the insulating medium [22].\nThe surfactants are the stabilizing agents (may or may\nnot be added in the liquid) which are used for the proper\ndistribution of NPs into the solution to minimize the set-\ntlement and coagulation of NPs [23]. Fe 3P is a magnetic\nnature bulky NP that requires stabilizing agents. The two-step\nmethod is selected in this experimental work for the synthesis\nof magnetic NFs as shown in Figure 1. For achieving the\nactive surface of the NPs, 10% concentration of the oleic acid\nsolution (500 ml solution) is intermixed by the application\nof magnetic stirrer for a period. 10% concentration of the\noleic acid solution is taken to be 0% of NP concentration for\nthis experiment. Further, the desired quantity of NPs is added\nto the prepared solution. NPs concentrations in the scale of\nmilligrams are added to form different NP concentrations\nFIGURE 1. Block diagram representation of nanofluid synthesis by the\ntwo-step method.\nof NFs In this experiment, 0.0012%, 0.0022%, 0.003% and\n0.004% of NP solutions are prepared for each type of NP.\nTo disperse the NPs completely into the solution, the solution\nundergoes the ultra-sonication process, which utilizes sound\nenergy having alternating high and low pressure for the dis-\npersion. Sonication is the process in which the ultrasound\nwaves whose frequency value of 20 kHz (20,000 cycles per\nsecond) or higher are used to create the vibrations for the\ndispersion of NFs. The solution is kept in the ultrasonicator\nfor around 2-3 hours. The sample was changed after every six\nrepetitive breakdowns.\nC. ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENT\nThe performance of any insulating oil can be investigated by\nsome speciﬁc set of experimental analyses in the form of\nwithstand breakdown strength, dielectric measurement, etc.\nBoth the measurements have been taken into consideration in\nthis article to investigate and analyze prepared NFs.\nThe ﬁrst measurement is the AC breakdown strength of\nNFs as the transformer functioning is based on the AC\nvoltage source. The dielectric breakdown involves numerous\npre-breakdown stages and is observed by the development of\nan arc which is the electrical short circuit causing a large ﬂow\nof the current between the electrodes. The BDVs of different\nNF samples are recorded using the oil breakdown tester as\nper IEC 60156 with two standardized electrode conﬁgura-\ntions as shown in Figure 2(a) and 2(b). The standardized\nelectrode conﬁgurations i.e., Verband Deutscher Elektrotech-\nniker (VDE) electrode which is a mushroom-shaped elec-\ntrode, and spherical electrode with speciﬁc gaping between\nthem to provide different stresses conditions. According to\nIEC 60156 standard, the method of dielectric breakdown test\nis performed by applying an AC test voltage with the help of\na step-up transformer. The frequency range of the test voltage\nshould be between 48 Hz to 62 Hz. The voltage supplied\nto the test sample should be 5 minutes after ﬁlling the oil\nvessel up to the oil level and the air bubbles must not be\nevident in the electrode gap. The voltage initially at zero,\nis raised at a rate of 2.0 kVs −1±0.2 kVs −1 and stopped till\nthe breakdown takes place. Figure 2(c) and 2(d) represents\nthe ﬂashover in the form of visible spark during dielectric\n163318 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. R.

At least two minutes break is maintained in each\nbreakdown test and no gas bubble exists within the electrodes\ngap before each breakdown measurement. Repetitive break-\ndowns are measured on each prepared ﬂuid sample where\nthere were no NPs evident on the electrode during or after the\nbreakdown process. The concentration of each type of NPs is\nkept consistent as much as possible in both base oil to attain\nuniformity.\nThe second measurement is the dielectric permittivity of\nthe oil. The relative permittivity of the prepared NFs has been\ncalculated by using the dielectric constant kit and standard oil\ntest cell. The standard dielectric is a capacitance and dissipa-\ntion factor (Tan δ) bridge which measures relative permittivity\nbased on the ratio of capacitance. The oil cell maintains the\nuniform air gap at each surface of the electrodes.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. AC BREAKDOWN STRENGTH\nThe result of the prepared NFs needs to be analyzed\nto properly observe the dielectric characteristics. Some\nresults of BDV of NFs are taken from author’s previ-\nuos work [24]. The normalization of breakdown voltage\n(BDV) is performed by dividing the mean breakdown volt-\nage of NF (BDV mean_nf ) to the breakdown voltage of their\nrespected base oil (BDVmean_base_oil ). The enhancement in the\nbreakdown strength needs to be investigated to evaluate the\nperformance of NF with the increase in NP concentration.\nThe percentage enhancement (1BDV (%)) is calculated by\nusing the formula as shown in equation (1).\n1BDV (%)=\n( BDVmean_nf\nBDVmean_base_oil\n−1\n)\n∗100 (1)\nThe comparative results of all NFs with different electrode\nconﬁgurations are provided in Figure 3. The variation in aver-\nage breakdown voltage with varying NF concentration are\nplotted. The mean breakdown voltage (BDV mean) and stan-\ndard deviation are also signiﬁcant for repetitive breakdown\ntesting as shown in Figure 3. The percentage breakdown\nenhancement for each NF at the individual NP concentrations\nis denoted in the graph accordingly along with the range in the\nbreakdown strength at each point. The electrode system VDE\nis represented by Mushroom-Mushroom (M-M) electrode\nsystem while the sphere-sphere (S-S) electrode system in all\nﬁgures. As the gap between the M-M electrode is larger than\nthe S-S electrode system which results in higher BDV for the\nM-M electrode system for each insulating ﬂuid.\nEach NF can sustain a speciﬁc amount of NP concentration\nwhich can be considered its saturation point or critical point.\nBeyond the saturation point, the addition of NP in the base oil\nnegatively inﬂuences its characteristics. The enhancement in\nthe breakdown voltage of the prepared magnetic NF is due to\nhigh electron scavenging property of the dispersed nanopar-\nticles during the application of the high voltage. Electron\nscavenging property of slow moving nanoparticles decrease\nthe rapid motion of electrons, which subdue the streamer\nformation, and lead to increase in the breakdown strength\nof the prepared NFs. The variation in normalized BDV for\niron phosphide NP-based NFs is shown in Figure 3(a). Fe 3P\nNPs-based NFs initially show positive enhancement with the\naddition of up to 0.0022% NP concentration with synthetic\nester oil as a base ﬂuid. Beyond this point, the normalized\nBDV shows a negative enhancement or drop in BDV for\nNP having the concentrations greater than 0.0022% with\nsynthetic ester as base ﬂuid. It indicates nanoparticles create\nagglomeration near the electrode developing high electric\nﬁeld resulting in lowering the breakdown voltage of NF. The\nsaturation in the NP is achieved above 0.0022% as shown\nin Figure 3(a). Breakdown strength is not measured above\n0.004%, as BDV drop below base oil BDV .\nWhen the base ﬂuid in NF is changed to natural ester oil,\nthe saturation point goes beyond 0.004% NP as shown in\nFigure 3(a) in both conﬁgurations. Also, Breakdown strength\nkeeps increasing with NP concentration with natural ester\noil. Natural ester oil shows more accumulation possibility\nfor NPs as compared to synthetic ester oil resulting in stable\ndispersion at higher concentration.\nSimilar trends are shown by iron oxide NPs with synthetic\nester oil as a base ﬂuid in NF as shown in Figure 3(b) except\nthat iron phosphide-based NF shows a larger drop as com-\npared with iron oxide-based NF. It is due to similar size and\nsimilar magnetic nature of both compounds. Enhancement in\nVOLUME 8, 2020 163319\nM. R.

The maximum\nbreakdown voltage is achieved at 0.0022% concentration\nTABLE 2. Properties of nanoparticles.\nunder the VDE electrode system while maximum enhance-\nment is found in the spherical electrode system. The maxi-\nmum enhancement of 33.5% is achieved with iron phosphide-\nbased NFs as compared with iron oxide-based NFs.\nFor cobalt (II, III) oxide-based NFs as shown in\nFigure 3(c), the breakdown voltage kept increasing with the\nincrease in the NP concentration indicating no saturation\npoint till the range of NP concentration taken in the exper-\niment. The non-achievement of saturation shows that the\nmaximum breakdown strength is above 0.004% NP concen-\ntration. Therefore, the maximum enhancement for all cobalt\n(II, III) oxide NFs is observed at 0.004% as saturation has\nnot been observed. The dissimilarities in trends observed in\ncobalt oxides NF as compared with iron oxides or iron phos-\nphide NFs are possibly due to the difference in the metallic\nproperties of the elements and size of NPs.\nB. RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY\nTable 3 represents the average relative permittivities of the\nprepared nanoﬂuids at different conditions. When compared\nwith the base oil, there has been a signiﬁcant increase in the\nrelative permittivity for all the types of NFs at the speciﬁc\nvalue of concentrations. Equation (2) is used to calculate the\npercentage change in dielectric permittivity (1 ∈r (%)) of\nNF with each increment in NP concentration.\n1∈r (%)=\n( ∈r_nf\n∈r_base_oil\n−1\n)\n∗100 (2)\nwhere, ∈r_nf is the relative permittivity of NF and ∈r_base_oil\nis the relative permittivity of base oil.\nFigure 4 shows the graphical comparisons of the relative\npermittivities of three types of NFs at different concentra-\ntions for two types of insulating oils. Figure 4(a) shows that\npercentage change in NFs with base ﬂuids as synthetic ester\noil where the maximum percentage change among all three\nNPs occurs at iron phosphide NP-based NF. Iron phosphide-\nbased NF shows the highest permittivity at 0.003% NP con-\ncentration among the three NFs, whereas, cobalt (II, III) oxide\nshows the least for synthetic ester base oil. The higher value of\npermittivity signiﬁes more charge accumulation capacity of\ndielectric materials.

When the concentration of the solution is\nincreased the number of particles increase indicating higher\npolarization than the host ﬂuid. Therefore, the permittivity\nof prepared NFs increase. However, the permittivity declined\ndue to the unstable nanoparticles in the solution.\nThe percentage change in relative permittivities of NFs\nwith natural ester as base oil are shown in Figure 4(b). Iron\n(II, III) oxide-based NF shows the highest relative permit-\ntivity at 0.0022% of NP concentration, but its permittivity\ndrops drastically with increasing NP concentration. Whereas\niron phosphide-based NF shows a continuous increase in\npermittivity with increasing NP concentration. On compar-\ning base ﬂuids, the relative permittivity of NF with natural\nester oil shows better results as compared to synthetic ester\noil. With the increase in NP concentration beyond the sat-\nuration point, dielectric properties drastically changed. Iron\nphosphide-based NF with natural ester oil shows promising\nresults as compared with other prepared NFs.\nC. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nThe multiple and lengthy data set of breakdown voltages\nrequire the estimation through a probability distribution\nmodel since normal distribution provides unclear or erro-\nneously low probability [25]. Weibull distribution is an\naccepted technique to determine the probability distribu-\ntion of the breakdown strength. Weibull distributions are\nemployed in many reliability and lifespan evaluations, which\nis based on the failure of the whole chain due to the presence\nof a weakest or failed link in it. The results comprise of\nmore than 20 breakdowns for each prepared NFs and base\noils. The equation (3) is the 2-parameter Weibull probabil-\nity density function having shape parameter (k ) and scale\nparameter (c) [26]. The voltage stress limit is governed by\nthese two parameters.\nf (V )=dF (V )\ndV =k\nc .\n(V\nc\n)k−1\n.e\n−\n(\nV\nc\n)k\n(3)\nV , c, and k are voltage (kV), scale factor, and shape fac-\ntor (dimensionless) respectively.

Figure 3\nshows the enhancement of the breakdown voltage whose\nvalue is taken as the average. Whereas, during the Weibull\nanalysis, each reading of the breakdown voltage for each\nprepared NFs is taken into consideration, and accordingly,\npoints on the graphs have been plotted. While recording\nthe breakdown voltage of the NFs, the values of breakdown\nvoltage are different whose illustrations are provided by the\nWeibull distribution curve with the breakdown probability.\nTherefore, by this analysis, the probability of breakdown of\nNFs at different voltage is analyzed. The shape parameter\nfor VDE electrode and sphere electrode conﬁgurations are\nestimated and tabulated in Table 4 and 5, respectively. The\nScale parameter for VDE electrode and sphere electrode\nconﬁgurations are estimated and tabulated in Table 6, and 7,\nrespectively. Further, the breakdown strength at 63.2% and\n1% probability are tabulated in Table 8, 9, and 10 for iron\nphosphide, cobalt (II, III) oxide, and iron (II, III) oxide-based\nNFs respectively to analyze probability distribution for each\nprepared NF.\nFor the graphical analysis of Weibull distribution, Figure 5\nrepresents the Weibull Probability Distribution of failure (%)\nwith respect to breakdown voltage (kV) for different NPs in\nsynthetic ester oil-based NFs. Both the electrode conﬁgura-\ntions have been plotted for NF with different NP concentra-\ntions.

CONCLUSION\nIn this article, a comparative study on the effects of NPs in\nsynthetic ester oil and natural ester oil has been performed\n163324 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. R.

The different electrode conﬁgurations have\nbeen used to determine the breakdown voltage and relative\npermittivity. The novel iron phosphide NPs have been pre-\npared and dispersed uniformly in ester oils by the two-step\nmethod. Breakdown strength and relative permittivity of the\niron phosphide-based NFs are compared with the other NFs in\nterms of NP types and their concentrations. Further, Weibull\nprobability distribution curves have been plotted and the\ntables have been formulated showing the breakdown voltages\nat 1% and 63.2% probability.\nAll the NFs show enhancements in their breakdown\nstrength, which are requirements of the insulating oil.\nThe maximum breakdown strength is achieved with iron\nphosphide-based NF at a speciﬁc concentration of NPs. The\nevaluation of iron phosphide-based NFs further requires life\nevaluation and stability, which can be improved to make\ncommercially competed. Future experimental analyses such\nas moisture effect, temperature, resistivity, acidity, viscosity,\netc. need to be performed to determine the potential of iron\nphosphide-based NFs to be used as the transformer oil.\nAPPENDIX\nA. BACKGROUND OF NANOFLUID\nNanoﬂuid (NF) is deﬁned as a colloidal solution developed\nwith the stable dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs) in the base\noil using stabilizing agents that enhance or add the char-\nacteristics in the prepared colloid [27]. Extensive research\nactivity on NFs has been devoted over the last decade, as the\naddition of a few nano-sized particles in the medium not just\nstrengthen the existing characteristics of ﬂuid but also intro-\nduce new properties that enhance its applicability [28], [29].\nRecently, many techniques have been employed to improve\nthe dielectric property of transformer oil with the addition of\nNPs to improve quality and enhance the dielectric ﬂuid [30].\nThe enhanced dielectric and thermal properties of NFs as\ncompared to the corresponding base liquid insulation are the\nreason for its futuristic applications in power transformers.\nNFs are categorized into different categories based on\nthe NP types: ceramic. pure metallic, non- metallic, oxide,\ncarbide, alloy, nano-scaled liquid droplets, and carbon-based\nNFs [31]. NFs applications are continuously developed in\ndifferent areas of engineering. Initially, the magnetic NFs\nwere fabricated using iron oxide which revealed enrichment\nin the dielectric as well as thermal strength [32]. The nature of\ninsulating liquid can be polar or non-polar and both showing\nimprovements in their properties with the dispersion of NPs\nat the optimum concentrations [33]. Various NPs including\nmagnetic, metallic, semi-conductive, and insulative nature\nare used with different insulating mediums to improve the\nquality of insulants. The other metal oxide NPs-based NFs\nlike TiO 2 [19], SiO 2, Al 2O3, CuO, ZnO, MgO [34] show\nenhancement in dielectric properties.\nThe magnetic NF is a colloid that constitutes magnetic\nNPs dispersed in a carrier liquid with the help of a surfac-\ntant as shown in Figure 7 [9]. Magnetic NFs have shown\nsome promising results in dielectric and thermal applications,\nFIGURE 7. Dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles in the dielectric fluid [9].\nwhich promotes further research. Possessing the magnetic\nproperty, it is feasible to regulate the ﬂuid ﬂow, heat transfer,\nand particle movement by the application of the magnetic\nﬁeld. This exceptional property of magnetic NFs is utilized\nin different ﬁelds like thermal engineering, electronics, bio-\nengineering, etc. NFs as the dielectric ﬂuid usually comprise\nof mineral oil, synthetic oil, and vegetable oil as base ﬂuid\nto provide high dielectric strength. The surfactants cover the\nNP’s active surface to minimize the possibility of coagulation.\nThis process helps to uniformly distribute the NPs into the\nsolution and improve the stability and heat transfer capabil-\nity [19].\nB. INFLUENCE OF SURFACE CHARGING OF\nNANOPARTICLES IN NANOFLUID\nThe polarizing characteristic of the magnetic NPs results in\nthe greater permittivity of NPs than the surrounding medium\nindicating instantaneous surface charging. The relaxed mag-\nnetic NPs in the ﬂuid behaves as the perfect conductors due\nto extremely short relaxation time and the electric ﬁeld line\nconverges on the NPs. Therefore, the uniform electric ﬁeld\ndistribution is not appearing in NFs due to the presence of\nNPs. The difference in the electric characteristics of NPs and\nﬂuid causes non-uniform ﬁeld which is given by the below\nequations (5) & (6) [35]:\nEr (r,θ)=E0cosθ\n[\n1 +\n{(\nd3\nnp\n4r3\n)( εnp −εf\nεnp +2εf\n)\ne−t/τ\n}\n+\n{(\nd3\nnp\n4r3\n)( σnp −σf\nσnp +2σf\n)\n(1 −e−t/τ)\n}]\n(5)\nEθ (r,θ)=E0sinθ\n[\n−1 +\n{(\nd3\nnp\n8r3\n)( εnp −εf\nεnp +2εf\n)\ne−t/τ\n}\n+\n{(\nd3\nnp\n4r3\n)( σnp −σf\nσnp +2σf\n)\n(1 −e−t/τ)\n}]\n(6)\nwhere, E0 is the Electric ﬁeld; (r, θ, z) is the cylindrical\ncoordinates at the time (t ), ε is the absolute permittivity, τ\nis the charge relaxation time, σ is electrical conductivity, NP\n– NPs, f is the ﬂuid. The calculation of charge relaxation time\nis given by [36]:\nτ =2εf +εnp\n2σf +σnp\n(7)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 163325\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Dielectric Performance of Magneto-NFs for Advancing Oil-Immersed Power Transformer\nFIGURE 8. Electric displacement and polarization of insulating medium\ndue to the presence of conductive NPs under electric field [30].\nGenerally, the time scale for streamer build-up in the\nstressed oil is between 10 −10s and 10 −6s. The NP inside the\ninsulating oils is shown in Figure 8 [30]. Figure 8(a) shows\nthe property of absorbing the ions when oil is undergoing the\nionization phase giving lesser freedom for the current path.\nThe lesser probability of breakdown at lower voltage thereby\ngiving inﬂated electrical stress-bearing capability as shown\nin Figure 8(b) and 8(c). The limited absorption capability of\nthe NFs, when the absorption capability reaches the saturation\npoint as shown in Figure 8(d), the absorption of the electrons\nis blocked, and breakdown takes place. When the concentra-\ntion of NPs is raised, the absorption capability of the NFs\nis elevated leading to a higher breakdown, when compared\nto the lower concentration. This indicates that when the con-\ncentration of the NPs is raised, there is an enhancement in the\ndielectric breakdown.\nThe ﬁnite element method (FEM) is widely used in the\nvisualization of the electric stress in power transformer insu-\nlation [37]. Thus, it becomes widely used and very informa-\ntive in determining the effect of the electric ﬁeld on NFs [38],\n[39]. In [38], the author explained the effect of NPs in the\ntransformer oil due to different dielectric properties creating\na non-uniform electric ﬁeld. In [39], the author explains low\nelectric ﬁeld stress near NP resulting in a higher breakdown\nvoltage of NFs. With a high surface current density of NPs,\neasier streamer penetration happens in natural ester. The\nimpact of NPs on streamer development is proportional to\nthe delay in the breakdown of insulation. In [35], the author\nperformed the experiment showing the linear increase in the\nnegative ion charge density distribution from the ionization\nzone to the needle electrode tip for pure transformer oil under\nneedle-sphere electrode system. Practically, charging decays\nafter reaching the saturation point in case of NFs which is\na contradiction to the expected linear charge density distri-\nbution. The ionization of the NF results in the liberation of\nboth the positive as well as negatively charged particles with\nthe rapid increment in negatively charged particle density.\nThe positively charged particles are practically immobile due\nto the higher weight as compared to the electrons. This is\nthe reason that the NPs come into contact with the electrons\nmore than the positively charged ions resulting in the neg-\natively charged nanostructure, thereby absorbing electrons.\nAs the NPs are crowded by negative charge, they repel the\nmovements of the electrons between the electrodes resulting\nin the weakening charge absorption effectiveness, and lesser\npossibility of the nanostructure to reach the saturation point.\nNanoparticles charge holding capacity (Q s) can be governed\nby the equation 8 [38].\nQs =\n\n\n\n−12πε1EoR2 conductive particle\n−12πε1EoR2 ε2\n2ε1 +ε2\ndielectric particle (8)\nwhere, E o, R, ε1, and ε2 are applied electric ﬁeld (V/m), the\nradius of particle (m), permittivity of oil, and permittivity of\nparticle respectively. It is clear from Eq. (8), the NPs with\nhigher permittivity exhibits better charge holding capacity\ndue to increased trapping of charges. More charges at low\nNF concentration results in higher trapping performance, and\nhigher breakdown strength. Also, the charge directly depends\non the radius (size) of NP. Therefore, the NP having a lower\nsize has a lower charge than a higher size NP. This means that\nfor the same NP under the same concentration but different\nNP size, the number of NPs is higher for the lower NP size.\nDue to this, it has been observed that at the same concentra-\ntion, there is an increment in the total saturation charge for the\nlower NP size than higher NP size. Therefore, the maximum\nbreakdown strength is higher for lower sized of NP at the\nsame concentration.\nC. INFLUENCE OF NANOPARTICLES ON THE RELATIVE\nPERMITTIVITY OF NANOFLUID\nThere are different methods proposed to ﬁnd the inﬂuence of\nnanoparticles on the relative permittivity of NFs as mentioned\nin [40]. The type of NP plays an important role in the overall\nrelative permittivity of NFs. Maxwell-Garnett equation for\nthe calculation of the relative permittivity of the mixed dielec-\ntric (here NF) is [41]:\nτ = εr,n −εr1\nεr,n +2εr1\n=ϕ εr2 −εr1\nεr2 +2εr1\n(9)\nwhere, εr1 and, εr2 are relative permittivities of the host ﬂuid\nand spherical NP respectively. εr,n, and ϕ are the relative\npermittivity of the NF and the spherical NP volumetric con-\ncentration respectively. In the case of transformer oil-based\nNFs, the NP contribution can be considered to be negligible\ndue to very low volumetric concentration, resulting in the\nnegligible effect of relative permittivity by NP. To consider\nthe effect of NP on relative permittivity, the polarization\nmodel is proposed in which both the host ﬂuid molecules\nand NP gets polarized. Polarization happens in the form of\nﬂuid polarization, inner NP polarization as shown in Figure 9\n[40]. Also, polarization takes place in the form of orienta-\ntional polarization of charged NP when considered as a polar\nmolecule. Clausius-Mossotti expressed the relative permittiv-\nity of transformer oil-based NF (ε r,n) considering all three\ntypes of polarization by the equation [41]:\nεr,n −1\nεr,n +2 = 1\n3ε0\n(N1α1 +N2α2 +N2α3) (10)\n163326 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Dielectric Performance of Magneto-NFs for Advancing Oil-Immersed Power Transformer\nFIGURE 9. Polarization of oil molecule and NP in TF oil-based NFs [40].\nwhere, α1, α2, and α3 are polarizability of transformer\noil molecule, NP due to inner polarization, and orienta-\ntional polarization of charged NP when considered as polar\nmolecule respectively. N 1 and N 2 are per unit volume of the\nnumber of molecules of transformer oil and NP respectively.\nClausius-Mossotti equation can be further deduced to the\nfollowing equation [40]:\nεr,n −1\nεr,n +2 =ε1 −1\nε1 +2 +ϕ\n3 (ε2 −1)\n+ ϕ\n3kT πε0a3E2\n0\n(εr2 −εr1\n2ε1 +εr2\n)2\n(11)\nwhere, k and T are Boltzmann constant and thermodynamic\ntemperature ( ◦K) respectively. The inference of the polar-\nization of the NF is that upon the increase in the NP con-\ncentration increases the permittivity of the NF. However, the\nexperimental result of the relative permittivity of NFs may\nnot be linear [42].\nREFERENCES\n[1] B. Du, X. Li, and M.
