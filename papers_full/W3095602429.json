In most conﬁgurations, each grid needs to be isolated for\npreventing the propagation of faults. Actual literature mostly\nconsiders a single isolated interconnection, which is not opti-\nmized for the interconnection of multiple AC and DC grids.\nBy utilizing the modularity of the Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB)\nconverter and the corresponding connected Dual Active Bridge\n(DAB) to each H-bridge, this work proposes a system design for\nfeeding multiple AC and DC grids. Requirements for the DC\ngrid isolation and integration are discussed and the proposed\ntopology is demonstrated to enable reduced losses compared to\nthe commonly adopted conﬁguration. The commonly adopted\nand the proposed conﬁguration are compared and experimental\nresults validate reduced losses for a large range of operation\ncompared to the conventional solution.\nIndex Terms—Smart Transformer, Hybrid Grid, Low Voltage\n(LV) DC, Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB)\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe increasing integration of renewable energy sources and\nelectric vehicle charging stations encourages the use of DC\ngrids, whereby today’s transmission and distribution is mostly\nadopted in AC [1]. A possible solution for the interconnection\nof an AC and a DC grid has been proposed [2]. However,\nthose connections are not optimum for the interconnection\nof multiple grids, because multiple power converters are\nneeded for the interconnection of the grids. Alternatively, a\ncentralized solution for the integration of DC grids in the\nAC infrastructure is the Smart Transformer (ST), which is\na solid state transformer with its control and communication\ncapability and it can provide DC-connectivity in Low V oltage\n(LV) and Medium V oltage (MV) levels [3], [4].\nSmart Transformer topologies have been proposed to in-\nterconnect MV AC-, LV AC- and LVDC grids. However, no\noptimization of the interconnection to isolated dc grids has\nbeen made so far and even the direct connection of the DC\ngrid to a LVDC link has been proposed [4]–[6]. Apart from\nthe isolation, the controllability is an important requirement in\nmost applications of DC grids, which cannot be provided in\nthis conﬁguration. A simple solution for the connection of the\nFig. 1. Scheme of a Smart Transformer with isolation (a) and without isolation\n(b) between LV AC and LVDC.\nDC grid is the use of an isolated DC/DC converter connected\nto the DC-link, which is shown in Fig. 1 (a). This fulﬁlls\nthe requirements, but power transfer from MV AC to LVDC\nis conducted through two medium frequency transformers,\nwhich is expected to deteriorate the efﬁciency of the power\nconversion.\nThis work proposes a DC-multibus topology based on a\ncascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter and dual active bridges,\nwhich are connected to a LVDC grid and a DC-link for\nfeeding an AC grid. This solution is compared by means of\nefﬁciency to the commonly adopted solution, where the DC\ngrid is fed by an isolated DC/DC converter from the DC-link.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed solution for a wide range of operating points.\nThis work ﬁrst introduces different grid conﬁgurations with-\nout the need for isolation and with the need for isolation in\nsection II. Section III introduces the proposed topology and\ncompares the efﬁciency to the commonly adopted solution.\nSection IV shows preliminary measurements on a test bench\nbefore concluding the work in section V .\nII. LVDC GRID INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe system design for the integration of LVDC grids\nthrough the Smart Transformer is driven by the requirements\nof the connected grid. In DC distribution grids, the voltage\nneeds to be controllable and isolation is a key requirement.\nA Smart Transformer topology, which fulﬁlls these demands\nis shown in Fig. 1 (a). Only in the case that purely isolated\nloads are connected to the DC grid, such as electric vehicle\ncharging stations, no galvanical isolation is needed as shown\nin Fig. 1 (b).\nAs the most important feature of the isolation, disturbances\ncan be prevented from passing through the grids and it prevents\nhigh fault and body currents [7]–[9]. In the case with isolation,\nhigh resistance grounding schemes can be applied to provide\na safer operation of the LVDC grid. While in the non-isolated\ncase, the produced common mode voltage between the LVDC\nand the LV AC grids will promote high fault and dangerous\nbody currents. So applying galvanic isolation between the\nLV grids in the ST will improve the safety of personnel and\nequipment.\nAdditionally, galvanic isolation between the LVDC and the\nLV AC grids provides a ﬂexible grounding scheme selection\nfor the LVDC and LV AC grids. Since combinations of low\nimpedance grounding schemes in both LV grids can make\nthe normal operation of the system impossible if no galvanic\nisolation between them is applied [10]. So the compatibility to\nseveral grounding conﬁgurations through the galvanic isolation\ncan be a valuable feature of the ST. Especially in the case that\nthe LVDC and the LV AC grids are designed beforehand and\njust a suitable ST is selected.\nAs disadvantages of galvanic isolation between the LVDC\nand the LV AC grids, a higher component count for the\nconverter is required and it potentially reduces the efﬁciency\nand increases the volume of the system. These disadvantages\nadditionally relate to the costs of the ST, whereby, the higher\npurchase costs are initially incurred and possibly reduced\nefﬁciency will increase the operating costs. The increased\nvolume will increase costs for the housing of the ST.\nTABLE I\nRATING OF THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF GALVANIC\nISOLATION BETWEEN LVDC AND LVAC\nAdvantages/Disadvantages Rating\nFlexible grounding scheme selection +\nPrevent disturbances passing through grids ++\nPrevent high fault and body currents + + +\nHigher purchase costs −\nHigher volume −\nLower efﬁciency −−\nThe rating in Table I shows the high signiﬁcance of the\nadvantages of the galvanic isolation between LVDC and\nLV AC. Thus, the safety of persons and equipment should\nbe prioritized compared to the costs. Therefore, an isolating\nDC/DC converter should be used between the DC grid and the\nLVDC link of the ST, if also non-isolated loads or non-isolated\ndistributed generators are connected to the DC grid.\nIII. P ROPOSED OPTIMIZED MODULAR ST TOPOLOGY WITH\nISOLATED DC GRID\nThe integration of DC grids in modular STs can be made\nwith an isolated DC/DC converter connected to a DC-link\nof a three stage Smart Transformer as shown in Fig. 2 (a).\nThe basic structure of the ST is chosen according to [4] as\na three-stage conﬁguration with a Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB)\nfor the AC/DC conversion on the MV AC side, followed by\nDual Active Bridges (DABs) for the DC/DC conversion, which\nalso provide galvanic isolation between the MV AC and the\nLV grids, and an inverter for the provision of LV AC grid.\nFor applying galvanic isolation between the LV AC and the\nLVDC grid, a DAB, which is providing the LVDC grid, is\nconnected to the DC-link. In the following, this is referred\nas Non-Interconnected Topology (NIT) as illustrated in Fig. 2\n(a).\nThis topology provides galvanic isolation between all con-\nnected grids, but for power transfer from the MV AC grid to the\nLVDC grid, the power is transferred through two transformers,\nwhich raises concerns against excessive losses. For this reason,\nthe Interconnected Topology (IT), as illustrated in Fig. 2 (b)\nis proposed. In the IT, a certain number of the DABs from the\nCHB are connected directly to the LVDC feeder and the DAB\nbetween the LV DC-link and the LVDC feeder is building an\ninterconnection. In the IT, it is possible to transfer power from\nthe MV AC to the LVDC grid with only two conversion stages,\nincluding only one transformer, instead of the three, including\ntwo transformers, in the NIT. Therefore, it is expected to\nachieve higher efﬁciency in many operating points besides the\nimproved fault tolerance for the LVDC grid.\nIn order to quantify the performance of the proposed\ntopology compared to the commonly adopted topology, an\nefﬁciency evaluation at all the operating points is required. The\nprocedure used for the evaluation of the efﬁciency is illustrated\nin Fig. 3. Firstly, the ideal waveforms of the converters\ndependent on the output power are derived [11]. Secondly,\nFig. 2. Structure of the NIT (a) and the IT (b).\nFig. 3. Modeling procedure to derive efﬁciency curves of the converters.\nthe conduction intervals and the occurrence of the switching\nlosses are identiﬁed. Thirdly, the semiconductor losses [12]\nand the transformer losses [11] are calculated. The considered\nsemiconductor modules are listed in Appendix A. So the\nefﬁciency curves of the converters can be calculated and used\nin an analysis of the power ﬂow to calculate the efﬁciency of\nthe system. The efﬁciencies of the NIT and the IT depending\non the active power of the LV AC grid PLVAC and that of the\nLVDC grid PLVDC are shown in Fig. 4. The borders of the\noperating area are done through the power limitations of the\ndifferent converters, as shown in Fig. 5. It can be recognized\nthat the NIT has a wider operating area when one LV grid is\nFig. 4. Efﬁciency of the NIT (a) and the IT (b) for varying PLVAC and PLVDC.\nFig. 5. Borders of the operating area due to the limitations of the different\nconverters and partial load operation at 50 %of Pmax.\nFig. 6. Efﬁciencies in the IT and the NIT for partial load operation with\nvarying PLVAC\nPLVDC\n.\ngenerating power and the other is consuming power. However,\nto realize the shown operating limitations by the converters the\nLVDC DAB in the NIT needs to be sized 50 %higher than\nthe interconnecting DAB in the IT. The angle of the border\nof the operating area due to the interconnecting DAB as well\nas the sizing of the interconnecting DAB are dependent on\nhow many DABs from the CHB are connected directly to the\nLVDC feeder.\nTo compare the efﬁciencies of the topologies, they are\nFig. 7. Comparison of the efﬁciencies in the IT and the NIT dependent on\nthe operating point.\nshown in Fig. 6 in partial load operation at 50 % of the\nmaximum power Pmax with varying the ratio PLVAC\nPLVDC\nwhile\ntheir sum remains the same. The localization of this line in\nthe operating area is shown in Fig. 5. For the identiﬁcation of\nthe operating area in which the IT provides higher efﬁciency,\nthe difference between the efﬁciency of the IT and that of\nthe NIT is shown in Fig. 7. When both LV grids consume\npower ( PLVAC > 0 ∩ PLVDC > 0), the IT is providing\nhigher efﬁciency for most operating points, up to an efﬁciency\nincrease of 0.89 %, which corresponds to a reduction of the\nlosses by 15 %. The efﬁciency peak for the IT in this area can\nbe relocated by adjusting the number of DABs from the CHB\nconnected directly to the LVDC feeder.\nTherefore, the IT can bring advantages in terms of efﬁ-\nciency and converter sizing for many use proﬁles. Further, the\nresults for the considered system are scalable as long as the\nratio between the MV AC voltage and the total power of the\nsystem is kept constant. Otherwise a different design of the\nconverters needs to be considered, with other semiconductors\nand transformer design. However, also other designs for the\nsystem provide similar results.\nIV. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nTo validate the analytical efﬁciency comparison between the\nIT and the NIT, small scale prototypes of both the topologies\nare tested in the laboratory. Since the CHB converter part is\ncommon for both topologies and the major difference lies in\nthe DAB converter connections, only the part consisting of the\nDABs connected to the CHB cells and the DAB between the\nLV DC-link and the LVDC feeder have been considered for\nloss comparison. The setup of three DABs is shown in Fig. 8\nand their conﬁguration for the representation of the part of the\nNIT and the IT is illustrated in Fig. 10. The equipment used\nfor the validation is shown in Fig. 9.\nThe parameters in the setup are chosen as shown in Table\nII. The waveforms of VDClink, VLVDC, the output currents of\nthe DABs, and the voltages on the primary and secondary side\nof the transformer of the ﬁrst DAB for the IT conﬁguration are\nshown in Fig. 11. The losses of the setup are measured with\na Yokogawa WT3000E power analyzer. The measurements\nare carried out so that they can be compared with the partial\nFig. 8.

Therefore, the ratio PLVAC\nPLVDC\nis varied\nwhile their sum stays the same. The measured losses in Fig.\n12 conﬁrm that the IT is providing lower losses in the most\noperating points for partial load operation. This complies with\nthe results from the theoretical analysis. Further, the operating\npoint with the lowest losses respectively the highest efﬁciency\nfor the IT is localized where the ratio PLVAC\nPLVDC\nis equal to the\nratio of the number of DABs from the CHB connected to\nthe LVDC link to the number of those connected directly to\nthe LVDC feeder. This is valid for the measurements in the\nlaboratory, for which both these ratios are 1, as well as for the\ntheoretical efﬁciency analysis, for which these ratios are 2.\nFig. 10.

C ONCLUSION\nWith the increasing emphasis for DC grid integration in\nthe power system, the paper investigates a novel Smart Trans-\nformer topology with potentially higher efﬁciency, better fault\ntolerance for the LVDC grid and the possibility to downsize\na converter compared to the commonly adopted topology.\nThe proposed isolated ST topology takes advantage of the\nCHB-DAB connections to enable lower number of power\nconversion stages between MV AC, LVDC and LV AC grids to\nachieve higher efﬁciencies at for a wide operation range. The\nanalytical results indicate a loss reduction of up to 15 %with\nthe proposed topology compared to the commonly adopted\none. For the assumed scenario, the converter between the\nLVDC link and the LVDC feeder in the proposed topology\ncan be downsized by 33 %compared to the commonly adopted\none. The experimental results validate the potential of a higher\nefﬁciency from the analytical ﬁndings.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. Gupta, S. Doolla, and K.
