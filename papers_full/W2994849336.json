  "abstract": "Frequency response analysis (FRA) is a popular method for assessing a transformer’s mechanical condition. The paper proposes a new method for interpreting the frequency response measurement results. The currently used numerical indices only give one value, which may be misleading in the analysis, while the proposed frequency response quality index (FRQI) tool analyses three separate features in the whole frequency range. The applied numerical calculations technique allows for estimations of not only the values of the average quality indices, but also locally for given frequency ranges of the analysed spectrum. It allows for determination of the problems that can be found in the active part of a transformer. The presented results come from three transformers, representing cases of typical faults. Two of them are from industry, while one was used for deformational tests in laboratory conditions. The proposed FRQI method showed its usefulness in FRA test results analysis and may be introduced into the automated assessment of such data. Each of the component parameters is sensitive to other types of differences observed between the compared frequency response curves, and may be used as a good quality detection tool.",
