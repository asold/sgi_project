For the power grid, renewable energy is\nbeneficial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and achieve\nclean, efficient, reliable and economic power supply. Large-scale main transformers and\nmedium and low voltage distribution transformers are widely distributed and occupy\nFrontiers in Energy Research 01 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\nimportant positions in the power grid. For the non-linear,\nuncertain and highly complex distribution network heavily\npenetrated by renewable energy ( Fu, 2022), the safety and\nreliability of transformers become particularly important. Many\nresearchers perform fault diagnosis of transformers in terms of\nshort-circuit impedance, frequency response, and many other\naspects. These methods are off-line diagnosis methods. Although\nthe accuracy or sensitivity of these methods is high, they\ncannot detect early transformer faults in time and waste human\nand material resources. Therefore, the researchers conducted\nonline monitoring of the oil of the transformer, analyzed the\ndissolved gas in the oil, and then diagnosed the early fault of the\ntransformer, and monitored the status of the transformer in real\ntime.\nDissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is a very effective diagnostic\nstrategy that is widely used to diagnose early faults in\noil-immersed transformers. In order to accurately diagnose\ntransformer faults, researchers have proposed several DGA\nmethods, including the critical gas method, Dornenburg ratio\nmethod, Rogers ratio method, IEC ratio method, Duval triangle\nmethod, etc. However, these methods have disadvantages such\nas coding defects, oversized coding boundaries, and critical\nvalue criterion defects, which affect the reliability of fault\nanalysis. Each method has drawbacks, strict boundaries and\nhidden relationships ( Y u et al., 2016). For example, the critical\ngas method requires the presence of a large amount of gas in the\noil sample, which in some cases cannot be concluded. Therefore,\nimproving the accuracy of identifying early transformer faults is\na current research hotspot.\nIntelligence techniques have now been widely used\nin transformer fault diagnosis with convincing results.\nUnlike traditional methods, artificial intelligence methods\nsimulate the survival and other behaviors of living beings\nto make decisions and optimize real problems, and the\nmethods target more general problem descriptions, which\nare generally more lacking in structural information, and\nare applicable to solve complex problems like transformer\nfault diagnosis. Intelligent techniques help to resolve the\nuncertainty of traditional DGA methods due to boundary\nproblems and unresolved codes or multi-fault scenarios\n(W ani et al., 2021). Researchers have applied many artificial\nintelligence techniques to DGA fault diagnosis, such as neural\nnetworks (Duan and Liu, 2011; W ang et al., 2016; Qi et al., 2019;\nY an et al., 2019; Y ang et al., 2019, 2020; Luo et al., 2020;\nV elásquez and Lara, 2020 ; Mi et al., 2021; Taha et al., 2021;\nZhou et al., 2021), support vector machine (SVM) ( W ang\nand Zhang, 2017 ; Fang et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018;\nIllias and Liang, 2018 ; Kari et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019;\nZeng et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhang Y . et al., 2020;\nBenmahamed et al., 2021), and clustering ( Islam et al., 2017;\nLi et al., 2018; Misbahulmunir et al., 2020). These techniques\ninvolve statistical machine learning, deep learning, etc. Statistical\nmachine learning and deep learning are not only core issues in\nthe field of artificial intelligence, but also one of the hot research\ndirections in electrical engineering today ( Fu et al., 2020).\nResearchers have applied these techniques not only to improve\nand enhance the DGA method only, but also to combine\nmultiple techniques so as to enhance the robustness of the\ndiagnosis method. In addition, researchers have also used\nintelligent techniques to mine the information in gas data\nand find the correlation between gas data and faults from\nthem in order to detect early faults in transformers more\naccurately.\nThis study reviews artificial intelligence methods used\nto diagnose oil-immersed transformers in order to improve\ndiagnostic performance of transformer and enhance the stability\nand reliability of operation. This paper introduces the intelligent\ntechniques that should be used for fault diagnosis, and compares\nand analyzes these techniques. Some researchers have also done\nsome reviews in this research topic. Ravi et al. (2019) analyze\nthe application of artificial neural networks, support vector\nmachines, decision trees and plain Bayes in transformer fault\ndiagnosis from the literature spanning 10 years. The authors\npoint out that the development of new algorithms is necessary\nto improve diagnostic accuracy. Taneja et al. (2016) review and\nsummarize both traditional methods of DGA and DGA-based\nintelligence techniques and hope that future research in this area\nwill not be limited to one diagnostic method. Ge et al. (2018)\nreview the application of improved DGA methods in transformer\nfault diagnosis in terms of AI algorithms combined with DGA\ntechniques, improvement of traditional DGA techniques, and\nstatistical methods for DGA interpretation. The authors find\nthat the visual graphical method is more effective in diagnosis\ncompared to the traditional code method, but there is still\nroom for improvement. Compared with these review articles,\nthis paper highlights the following differences. First, this paper\nsummarizes and analyzes more AI techniques, such as clustering,\ndeep learning, and DS evidence theory. Second, this paper also\nsummarizes the ideas of previous studies, such as the treatment of\nimbalanced data, the selection of the most optimal set of special\nfeatures, the consideration of time as the key information, and the\navoidance of information loss due to dimensionality reduction as\nmuch as possible. In addition to the selection and improvement\nof diagnostic methods, the processing of data is also a very\nimportant part of transformer fault diagnosis. The framework\nfor improving DGA performance with AI techniques is shown\nin Figure 1.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 1 briefly discusses\nthe traditional DGA method and its shortcomings, and shows\nthe advantages of AI techniques that can compensate for\nthe limitations of the traditional method. Section 2 analyzes\nthe application of various AI techniques in transformer\nfault diagnosis. Specifically, neural networks, support vector\nmachines, clustering, deep learning, and other techniques are\nFrontiers in Energy Research 02 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\nFIGURE 1\nEnhancing DGA performance with AI techniques.\nincluded. Section 3 draws the conclusion, and the application of\nAI techniques in transformer fault diagnosis is prospected.\n2 Enhancing dissolved gas analysis\nperformance with appropriate\nimprovements techniques\n2.1 Neural networks\nNeural networks can adequately approximate arbitrarily\ncomplex nonlinear relationships, and after learning from the\ninitialized inputs and their relationships, it can also infer\nunknown relationships from unknown data, thus allowing the\nmodel to generalize and predict unknown data. Many researchers\nhave combined neural networks with DGAs, such as RBF neural\nnetworks (Mi et al., 2021), probabilistic neural networks (PNN)\n(Y u et al., 2016; Y ang et al., 2019, 2020), Elman neural networks\n(Duan and Liu, 2011 ), etc. Many researchers have also applied\nPNN to early fault diagnosis in transformers. However, the\nperformance of PNN is largely influenced by the smoothing\nfactor of its hidden layer elements, which can affect the\nclassification performance ( Y ang et al., 2019). Taha et al. (2021)\ncombines CNN with DGA in order to accurately predict the\ntype of faults in transformers at different noise levels, up to\n20% for each level. The results show that CNNs are more\nimmune to noise and have optimal performance compared to\nother intelligent techniques. In addition, different input ratios\nlead to different prediction accuracies. Among them, the mixed\nratios(conventional and five gas percentage ratios and new form\nsix ratios together) as input to the CNN has the highest prediction\naccuracy of more than 92%.\nIn order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of DGA,\nresearchers also combine several artificial intelligence methods\nso as to improve the robustness and diagnostic accuracy of\nthe diagnostic model. Among them, to enhance the diagnostic\nperformance of PNN, intelligent optimization algorithms such\nas bat algorithm (BA) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) can\nbe used to optimize the smoothing factor ( Zhou et al., 2021).\nY an et al. (2019) combine BP neural network with improved\nAdaboost algorithm, then combined with PNN neural network\nto form a series of diagnostic models for transformer faults,\nand finally combined with dissolved gas in oil analysis for\ntransformer fault diagnosis. V elásquez and Lara (2020) propose\na new method with the lowest computational cost, using a\ngenetic algorithm to optimize the ANN classifier, which is\nused to classify faults, replacing the traditional reinforcement\nlearning (RL) action selection process with a genetic algorithm-\nbased optimizer. W ang et al. (2016)establish a combination of\nintelligent methods for transformer fault diagnosis evaluation\nand neural network case inference based on a knowledge base\nand an oil chromatography fault diagnosis case base. Through\nFrontiers in Energy Research 03 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\npractical tests, this integrated method proved to be effective\nin diagnosing potential faults inside transformers, avoiding the\ndisadvantages of misclassification or incomplete coding of the\ntraditional three-ratio method, and improving the accuracy of\ntransformer fault diagnosis to a certain extent. However, this\nmethod has not been validated for sudden faults, and future\nresearch is needed to analyze sudden faults of transformers.\nDissolved gas concentrations can change over time. In order\nto track the dissolved gas concentration over time, researchers\nhave adapted methods that can analyze time series. A new LSTM\nmodel (SDAE-LSTM) is proposed ( Luo et al., 2020) to identify\nand parametrically analyze dissolved gases in the insulating oil\nof power transformers. SDAE has strong ability of mining the\ninternal features of data and anti-interference ability. LSTM\nis able to selectively LSTM can selectively “memorize” data,\nwhich is suitable for processing time series data. Therefore, the\nmodel’s ability to “memorize” data makes it possible not only\nto detect changes in dissolved gas concentrations over time, but\nalso to explore the internal characteristics of the gas data. In\nthe concentration prediction, there is an obvious “time-shift”\nerror in the prediction curve, which leads to the deviation of\nthe prediction results from the actual data. Therefore, a deep\nrecursive confidence network (DRBN) model is proposed by\nQi et al. (2019), which incorporates an adaptive delay network in\nDBN. The model can effectively overcome the “time-shift” error,\nand the prediction accuracy can reach more than 95.16%.\nThe application of neural networks for fault diagnosis is\nshown in Figure 2.\n2.2 Deep learning\nDeep learning was proposed by Geoffrey Hinton et al. at\nthe University of T oronto in 2006, and it was introduced into\nmachine learning to bring it closer to its original goal—artificial\nintelligence. Compared with “shallow learning” methods such\nas support vector machines, boosting, and maximum entropy\nmethods, deep learning performs more layers of nonlinear\noperations and breaks the traditional neural network limit on\nthe number of layers. The feature data learned by deep learning\nmodels are more intrinsically representative of the original\ndata, which greatly facilitates classification and visualization\nproblems. Therefore, deep learning is increasingly popular\namong researchers in the field of transformer fault diagnosis.\nCui et al. (2016) combine deep confidence network (DBN), BP\nneural network, DGA triple ratio and eigengas method and\nexpert system to improve the reliability of diagnostic results\nand also demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of DBN\nfor transformer fault diagnosis. Mehdipourpicha et al. (2019)\nuse deep neural network (DNN) to identify the identified\nfault types of Duval triangles. The DNN achieved very high\ndiagnostic accuracy compared to k-nearest neighbor (k-NN)\nFIGURE 2\nUsing neural networks in order to improve the performance of fault diagnosis.\nFrontiers in Energy Research 04 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\nFIGURE 3\nDeep learning-based fault dignosis methods.\nalgorithm and random forest algorithm for different data set\nsizes.\nIn addition to purely deep learning algorithms for\ntransformer fault identification, researchers have proposed\nmany diagnostic ideas. Liang et al. (2018) proposed a DBN-\nbased DGA algorithm that automatically establishes a mapping\nrelationship between the characteristic gas and the fault type.\nDifferent from the traditional data processing, the authors\ndivided the DGA data into three categories: training data, fine-\ntuned data, and test data. For training data, the authors initialize\nthe parameters of DBN by unsupervised learning. The fine-tuned\ndata are used to fine-tune the parameters of the DBN. On the test\ndata, DBN achieves good diagnostic accuracy. Compared with\nBP neural network, DBN has superior recognition accuracy and\ngeneralization ability. In practical situations, transformer fault\ndata are not easy to collect, and thus the obtained data sets are\nusually unbalanced. Therefore, in order to solve the problem well\nand improve the recognition rate of fault types, many researchers\nhave proposed some measures. Lopes et al. (2021) use the\nboundary SMOTE method for oversampling, thus balancing\nthe dataset. The DNN incorporating the boundary SMOTE\nmethod has the highest diagnostic accuracy compared to the\ntraditional DGA method, artificial neural network, and DNN\ntrained with unbalanced data. Zhang L. et al. (2020) propose\na one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN)\nmodel based on cost-sensitive learning, which focuses more on\na small number of fault types. The cost matrix of this model\nwas also optimized by a particle swarm algorithm in order to\nimprove the diagnostic recognition rate. The final results show\nthat the model is able to achieve the expected results with more\naccurate identification of the few classes, thus improving the\nidentification accuracy of fault diagnosis. Obviously, processing\nfor unbalanced data can achieve better results and is one of the\nhot spots of current research.\nFigure 3 shows the framework diagram of deep learning-\nbased fault diagnosis methods.\n2.3 Support vector machine\nSupport vector machine (SVM) is also widely used in\nfault diagnosis to improve the accuracy of fault classification.\nSVM is an effective method to deal with large dimensionality\nof independent variables without recalculating from initial\nconditions to obtain new decision boundaries (Kim et al., 2019).\nHowever, the classification accuracy using a single SVM is\nnot very high. Therefore, many researchers have combined\nother intelligent methods with SVMs to effectively improve\nthe classification performance and achieve convincing results.\nIllias and Liang (2018) propose an improved evolutionary\nparticle swarm algorithm (Modified Evolutionary particle\nswarm optimization, MEPSO). EPSO combines particle swarm\nalgorithm and evolutionary strategy by introducing variational\noperations that are able to preserve the superior properties\nof particles. In addition, the authors introduce the time-\nvarying acceleration coefficient (TV AC) based on EPSO to\nimprove the robustness of the algorithm. Finally, the SVM-\nMEPSO-TV AC method is obtained by mixing MEPSO with\nSVM. Kari et al. (2018) combine GA and SVM for optimizing\nparameters and selecting the best subset of features. The final\nresults validate the robustness and generalization of the best\nfeature subset selected by GA-SVM, thus verifying the availability\nand effectiveness of the best feature subset and GA-SVM. In\naddition, optimal diagnosis cannot be achieved by using a single\nclass of features, and the introduction of some new features\nis necessary. Zhang Y . et al. (2020) point out that SVM can\neasily cause misclassification of samples distributed at decision\nboundaries, which leads to failure to accurately diagnose faults.\nTherefore, the authors combined GA, PSVM and fuzzy three-\nratio (FTR) method to determine whether the samples are at\nthe decision boundary or not by using probabilistic approach to\ndiagnose the samples that are not at the decision boundary. And\nthe samples that are at the decision boundary are diagnosed\nusing FTR. This method improves the accuracy of fault\nFrontiers in Energy Research 05 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\ndiagnosis and has strong robustness. In addition, researchers\nhave also combined computational intelligence techniques\nsuch as bat algorithm (BA) ( Benmahamed et al., 2021)\nand gray wolf algorithm ( Zeng et al., 2019) with SVM\nto obtain transformer fault diagnosis models with good\nresults.\nIt is known that the selection of the optimal set of\nfeatures can improve the performance of fault identification\n(Kari et al., 2018). Many researchers have proposed methods to\nselect a subset of features and establish intelligent algorithms\nto optimize SVM for transformer fault diagnosis models,\nwhich can improve the reliability and robustness of diagnosis.\nFang et al. (2018) establish the genetic-algorithm-SVM-feature-\nscreen (GA-SVM-FS) model to screen out the hybrid DGA\nfeature set. The accuracy of this feature set is 3–30% higher\nthan the feature set formed by DGA gas or gas ratio. Then, the\nImproved Social Group Optimization-Support V ector Machine\n(ISGOSVM) Classifier was built for diagnosing transformer\nfaults using OHFS as input, and compared with other models,\nthe ISGOSVM Classifier achieved the best diagnostic accuracy\ncompared to other models. Huang et al. (2018) propose a new\nintelligent diagnosis system for DGA, which is divided into a\nfeature selection module and a fault diagnosis module, where the\ngenetic algorithm-simulated annealing-SVM model is used for\nthe feature selection module and the artificial bee colony-SVM\nmodel is used for the fault diagnosis. The results show that the\nmethod is reliable, and has a strong anti-interference capability.\nZhang et al. (2019) use GA-SVM model to select the DGA\nfeature set and optimized the parameters of SVM using Improved\nKrill Herd (IKH) Algorithm to establish IKHSVM fault diagnosis\nmodel. The results show that IKHSVM outperforms GASVM, BP\nneural network (BPNN) and PSOSVM.\nIn addition to algorithm improvement, the sample size of\nthe transformer is also an aspect worth investigating. Different\nalgorithms are applicable to data with different sample sizes.\nChoosing the appropriate algorithm according to the sample\nsize can effectively improve the accuracy of transformer fault\ndiagnosis. W ang and Zhang (2017) propose a transformer fault\ndiagnosis method that divides the diagnosis process into two\ntimes. According to the size of the sample, multiple diagnostic\nmodels are used for the preliminary diagnosis, and then SVM is\nused for the secondary diagnosis. For the preliminary diagnosis,\na combination of FA-GEP diagnostic model for large samples,\nSVM diagnostic model for small samples, and cloud object\nmetamodel without creating samples as diagnostic models can\neffectively improve the diagnostic accuracy.\nImproved SVM-based fault diagnosis methods is shown in\nFigure 4.\n2.4 Clustering\nMany clustering algorithms are widely used in transformer\nfault diagnosis. Researchers apply clustering algorithms to DGA\ndata or combine with other data to be able to classify transformer\nfaults effectively. Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM\nclustering algorithm) is a classical method of clustering, but\nthe clustering accuracy for dissolved gas data is not high\nenough to classify transformer faults accurately ( Li et al., 2018).\nTherefore, Li et al. (2018) propose a new exponential similarity\nfunction and affiliation function for FCM clustering, and the\nnew affiliation function has no local extrema, which is beneficial\nto the classification of the algorithm. The improved FCM\nclustering can identify transformer faults well and classify DGA\nFIGURE 4\nImproved SVM-based methods for fault diagnosis.\nFrontiers in Energy Research 06 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\nFIGURE 5\nClustering methods for fault diagnosis.\ndata accurately, and the clustering performance of FCM is\nalso improved. Self Organizing Map (SOM) clustering can be\nused to classify early transformer faults and can reflect the\nseverity of transformer faults. It can organize data spatially\nwhile maintaining topological relationships among data features,\nwhich is useful for analyzing high-dimensional data (e.g., DGA\ndata). In addition, 60% of the training data is sufficient to train\nthe SOM with good diagnostic accuracy compared to supervised\nlearning methods such as SVM, which improves the diagnostic\nsensitivity of the SOM (Misbahulmunir et al., 2020).\nIn addition to clustering algorithms alone, combining\nclustering algorithms with other intelligent techniques has been\nconsidered for transformer fault diagnosis. Islam et al. (2017)\ncombine the k-Means Algorithm (KMA) with the k-Nearest\nneighbour (KNN) algorithm for the diagnosis of early\ntransformer faults. The method first uses KMA to generate\nclusters and then uses the KNN algorithm to determine which\nclusters are closest to the unclassified dataset. The method is\nable to classify data that cannot be classified by Duval’ s triangle\nwith an accuracy of 93%, which is an important addition to\nDuval’ s triangle. However, the method is still unable to classify\ndielectric and thermal hybrid faults effectively. Tang et al. (2018)\npropose a transformer anomaly detection method based on\nadaptive kernel fuzzy C-means clustering (KFCM) algorithm\nand kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The method\ncompares the projection of the old and new data and the change\nof the anomaly detection limit to determine whether there is an\nanomaly in the transformer according to the different operating\nstates and the time lapse.\nThe framework diagram of the clustering methods applied by\nthe researchers is shown in Figure 5.\n2.5 Other techniques\nIn addition to neural networks, SVM and clustering,\nresearchers have also applied other AI techniques in fault\ndiagnosis, such as logistic regression ( Almoallem et al., 2021)\nand association rules (Lee et al., 2013), with good results.\nDecision trees have also been widely used to improve the\naccuracy of fault diagnosis by using DGA data to enhance fault\nclassification. Decision tree algorithms have been shown to be\neffective in processing DGA data of oil-immersed transformers,\noutperforming SVM, Bayesian algorithms, and neural networks\nin terms of diagnostic performance. In addition, applying the\ndecision tree algorithm to the KNIME platform greatly reduces\nthe time spent compared to MATLAB ( Han et al., 2016). The\ntransformer fault diagnosis model based on the improved KNN\nalgorithm and decision tree proposed by ( Kherif et al., 2021)\nimproves the number of neighbors and the type of distance of\nthe KNN algorithm, thus improving the diagnostic accuracy of\nthe model, with a final accuracy of 93.75%. Although combining\nthe KNN algorithm with the decision tree principle has good\nrobustness, the performance of the method is very dependent\non the type of distance, the number of neighbors, and how to\ncombine the responses of the neighbors.\nD-S Evidence Theory (DET) is an information fusion method\nthat has the ability to handle uncertain information. Compared\nwith Bayesian theory, DET does not need to know the prior\nprobability and can represent “uncertainty” well, so it is widely\nused to deal with uncertain data. The transformer fault diagnosis\nproblem can be viewed as a multi-attribute decision problem,\nso DET is well suited to solve this problem. However, when\nthere is a high degree of conflicting evidence, it falls into\nZadeh’ s paradox and cannot reasonably assign Basic Probability\nAssignment (BPA) to the conflicting quantities. T o address\nthis problem, researchers have introduced DS evidence theory\nwith appropriate improvements so that it can be used to\naccurately diagnose potential transformer failures and avoid\nmisdiagnosis as much as possible. Shang et al. (2019) introduce\nweight coefficients to readjust the BPA to obtain the Improved\nD-S Evidence Theory (IDET), thus avoiding the difficulty\nin resolving conflicting evidence. In addition, to enrich the\ninformation sources and improve the accuracy of diagnosis,\nFrontiers in Energy Research 07 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\nbefore using DET for the final diagnosis, the introduction\nof hypersphere multiclass support vector machine (HMSVM),\nhybrid immune algorithm (HIA) and kernel extreme learning\nmachine (KELM) for preliminary diagnosis of DGA data, and if\nthe diagnosis results are consistent, the results are output directly.\nOtherwise, the diagnostic models of the three models need to\nbe used as input and IDET is used for comprehensive diagnosis\nto obtain the final diagnostic results. The results show that the\ndiagnostic accuracy of HMSVM is higher compared with HIA\nand KELM. IDET overcomes the problem of high conflict among\nevidences, and the diagnostic accuracy of using it to fuse multiple\ndata sources is higher than 94%, which is better than that of a\nsingle method.\nFuzzy logic has also been used by researchers in DGA fault\ndiagnosis. Fuzzy logic can be used to diagnose the severity of\nfaults and provide guidance to technicians to measure the overall\ncondition of the transformer so that reasonable maintenance\nmeasures can be developed to prevent faults from occurring.\nPoonnoy et al. (2021)fuse fuzzy logic with each of the three DGA\nalgorithms to identify transformer faults and their severity. The\nfuzzy logic allows the calculation of the fault index percentage,\na parameter that gives a good indication of the severity of\ntransformer faults. However, the performance of pure fuzzy\nlogic is not very good. Malik et al. (2020) fuse fuzzy theory with\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a classifier for early transformer\nfaults. For accurate classification, the most appropriate variables\nare selected as input to the fuzzy RL classifier using J48\nalgorithm for DGA data. The experimental results show that\nthe fuzzy RL classifier achieves 99.7% fault identification\naccuracy, which is significantly better than other soft computing\nmethods.\nMalik and Mishra (2016)use Gene Expression Programming\n(GEP) for DGA fault diagnosis, which is widely used for data\nclassification problems. The performance of DGA data processed\nwith this method is much better than IEC/IEEE, fuzzy logic,\nANN, and SVM methods. However, the accuracy of the GEP\nmodel for diagnosis suffers when detecting multiple faults, and\nusing more DGA data for training can only improve this situation\n(Abu-Siada, 2019).\nAs analyzed in the previous paper, time is also one of the\nimportant information for transformer fault diagnosis, because\ndissolved gas in oil changes with time, and if this factor of time is\nignored, then part of the information for fault diagnosis will be\nlost. Jiang et al. (2019) state that Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\nis a suitable solution for time-dependent modeling. Solving the\ntransfer probabilities of different health conditions by HMM\nenables short-term prediction of transformer faults.\nIn industry, visual inspection to diagnose early faults\nin transformers requires huge costs, and therefore, most\nDGA data are unlabeled. T o deal with this sparse labeled\ndata, Misbahulmunir et al. (2020) use SOM to perform\ndimensionality reduction and to cluster adjacent data. However,\nKim et al. (2020) point out that dimensionality reduction leads\nto the loss of key information, while clustering does not\nguarantee the correlation between high-level features. Therefore,\na semi-supervised autoencoder with an auxiliary task (SAAT) is\nproposed for DGA fault diagnosis. semi-supervised autoencoder\n(SSAE) generates a 2D health SAAT is an auxiliary detection\ntask inserted in the loss function of SSAE to detect faults and\nnormal states and to visualize health degradation features. In\naddition, the model does not require additional dimensionality\nreduction and allows direct visualization of high-level features in\n2D. Experimental results show that SAAT outperforms principal\ncomponent analysis, sparse autoencoder (SAE), and deep belief\nnetwork (DBN) in terms of health degradation performance\nresults by being above 90% in all metrics of fault detection and\nidentification.\n3 Conclusion and prospect\nThis paper reviews the application of artificial intelligence\ntechniques in transformer DGA fault diagnosis. Artificial\nintelligence techniques diagnose faults by mining the\nrelationship that exists between dissolved gases in oil and\ntransformer faults. Researchers have proposed various diagnostic\nmethods from different aspects to improve the accuracy of\nfault diagnosis. Among them, many researchers improve the\nexisting intelligent algorithms by adjusting a certain part of\nthe algorithm or combining the corresponding strategies of\nother intelligent algorithms so as to enhance the robustness\nof the algorithm. Although this can improve the accuracy of\nfault diagnosis, it does not do much work on analyzing DGA\ndata and is not targeted enough. Some researchers have been\nable to effectively improve fault identification performance by\nselecting appropriate algorithms based on the size of the DGA\ndata. In addition, researchers also found that time plays an\nimportant role in DGA fault diagnosis because dissolved gas\nin oil changes with time, and ignoring the factor of time can\nlead to loss of information. Therefore, researchers have adopted\nLSTM, DRBN, HMM, which can analyze time series for fault\ndiagnosis, so as to effectively extract fault features or overcome\n“time-shift” errors. Artificial intelligence methods have strong\ndata mining capability, but for classification problems, when a\nnew fault appears, artificial intelligence methods will classify the\nnew fault with existing faults based on previous experience data,\nwhich will lead to a decrease in diagnostic accuracy. In addition,\nthe DGA data does not fully reflect the transformer status, and\nit needs to be combined with new monitoring data for a more\neffective fault diagnosis of the transformer.\nFrontiers in Energy Research 08 frontiersin.org\nZhang et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.1006474\nAuthor contributions\nYZ: Conceptualization.
