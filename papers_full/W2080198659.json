Chinese Sci Bull, 2011, 56: 700−703, doi: \n10.1007/s11434-010-4083-6 \n \n \n \nWith the development of information technology, materials \nwith good performance and devices with minimal size are \nhighly sought after. The development of new materials and \nthe design of complex composites have become major re-\nsearch topics. Multiferroic mate rials have attracted increas-\ning interest for their complex properties [1–3]. Magneto-\nelectric materials exhibit both electric and magnetic proper-\nties, and the magnetoelectric effect can be produced by \ncoupling the electric and magnetic properties. Magnetoelec-\ntric materials are multifunctional materials, which have po-\ntential applications in magnetic sensors, magnetoelectric \ntransducers and data storage devices [4,5]. Many single- \nphase magnetoelectric materials have weak magnetoelectric \ncoupling and commonly operate at low temperatures [6,7], \nmaking them difficult to apply.  In contrast, magnetoelectric \ncomposites enjoy strong magnet oelectric coupling at room \ntemperature. Moreover, the magnetoelectric coefficients can \nbe adjusted by changing the phase relationships, which is \ncurrently attracting the attention of researchers [3]. In recent \nyears, researchers have been optimizing the magnetoelectric \noutput through experimental and theoretical studies . In  \n                      \n*Corresponding author (email: zhoujp@snnu.edu.cn) \nparticular, laminated magnetoelectric  composites exhibit a \nvery strong magnetoelectric coupling around their resonant \nfrequency [8–12], which has been used as an amplifier [13]. \nA Rosen-type transformer has enhanced the magnetoelectric \ncoefficient of the composite [14,15].  A magnetoelectric de-\nvice with double output ports was obtained by combining \nTerfenol-D alloy and a PMN-PT transformer [16]. The key \nproblem is how to use magnetoelectric composites in de-\nvices. \nThe Rosen-type transformer is divided into two basic \nparts. The input part is polarized across its width and the \noutput part is polarized along its length. When applying an \nalternating voltage on the input port of the transformer, an \namplified voltage was inspired at the output port. \nIn this study, we propose a composite transformer by \ncombining a magnetostrictive alloy and a Rosen-type trans-\nformer. The step-up ratio of th e transformer can be adjusted \nthrough the direct and converse magnetoelectric effects. \n1  Experimental method \nA magnetoelectric composite transformer was prepared by \n Lü L, et al.   Chinese Sci Bull    March (2011) Vol.56 No.7 701 \nbonding a Terfenol-D slice and a Rosen-type transformer \nwith epoxy bonder. The Rosen-type transformer was bought \nfrom Kong Hong New-Materials Ltd, Xi’an, China. The \ndimensions of the transformer are 28.2 mm×5 mm×2 mm \nand it is divided into two parts as shown in Figure 1. The \nratio of input to output parts of the transformer is 1 :1.13. \nTerfenol-D with high magnetostriction was supplied com-\nmercially (Baotou Rare Earth Research Institute, China) \nwith dimensions of 27.8 mm×4.1 mm×2.51 mm. The com-\nposite was cured at 150 ˚C for half an hour under 150 MPa \nto get good mechanical coupling. For comparison purposes, \nthe Terfenol-D was polished to thicknesses of 2.07, 1.77, \n1.52 and 1.3 mm. \nThe voltage step-up ratio of the magnetoelectric compos-\nite transformer was defined by the output voltage ( V\nout) in \nresponse to the input voltage ( Vin), i.e. t = Vout/Vin. The sine \nvoltage Vin was applied to the input port of the transformer \nwith a signal generator, and the output voltage  V out was \nmeasured using an oscilloscope with a 1 M Ω resistance \nload. Resonance occurs when the driving frequency is near \nthe natural frequency of the magnetoelectric composite \ntransformer and a stronger voltage step-up ratio is achieved. \nGenerally, we used a voltage near the resonance frequency, \nand studied the transformer prop erties near that frequency. \nThe magnetoelectric composite transformer was put in a \nmagnetic field. The voltage step-up ratio was measured un-\nder various magnetic fields applied along the length of the \ncomposite. \n2  Results and discussion \nFigure 2(a) shows the frequency dependence of the voltage \nstep-up ratio for the pure Rosen-type transformer. Two \nresonant peaks appear around 59 kHz and 118 kHz, corre-\nsponding to the half- and full-wavelength resonant modes. \nThe relative voltage step-up ratio is 75 and 115. Figure 2(b) \nshows the frequency dependence of the voltage step-up ratio \nunder various magnetic fields for the magnetoelectric com- \n \nFigure 1  Illustration of the magnetoelectric composite transformer. The \nmagnetic field was applied along the length of the transformer. \nposite transformer with a Terfen ol-D thickness of 2.51 mm. \nSimilarly, two large sharp peaks of voltage step-up ratios \nappear at 51 kHz and 101 kHz, representing the half- and \nfull-wavelength vibration modes. The step-up ratio without \nan external magnetic field is 3.1 and 4.2 for the half- and \nfull-wavelength modes. In comparison with the pure PZT \ntransformer, the step-up ratio decreased due to the load of \nthe Terfenol-D plate. After applying the magnetic field, the \nstep-up ratio clearly changed. The step-up ratio peaks de-\ncreased and then increased with the magnetic field, while \nthe resonant frequency increased, which was due to the dif-\nferent acoustic velocities of the magnetostrictive Terfenol-D \nunder different magnetic fields [15,17]. \nThe step-up ratios at half- and full-wavelength resonant \nfrequencies share similar characteristics. The Rosen-type \ntransformer commonly works at the full-wavelength vibra-\ntion mode. Therefore, we studied the step-up ratio charac-\nteristics with the magnetic field in the full-wavelength vi-\nbration mode. As shown in Figure 3, the step-up ratios with \ndifferent Terfenol-D thicknesses share similar characteris-\ntics with the bias magnetic field. The step-up ratios increase \nat first and then decrease with increasing magnetic field. \nWithout an external magnetic field, the step-up ratio for the \nsample with a Terfenol-D thickness of 1.33 mm is 7.7. It \nchanges to 4.2 at 250 Oe and 9.2 at 2500 Oe. The step-up \nratio nearly doubles over th e magnetic field range of 0 –250 \nOe. Therefore, we can adjust the step-up ratio by changing \nthe magnetic field. The step-up ratio, under the same mag-\nnetic field, increases with decreasing Terfenol-D thickness  \n \nFigure 2  Frequency dependence of the voltage step-up ratio of (a) a pure Rosen-type transformer and (b) a magnetoelectric composite tran sformer under \nselected magnetic fields. \n702 Lü L, et al.   Chinese Sci Bull    March (2011) Vol.56 No.7 \nfrom 2.51 to 1.3 mm. The step-up ratio, without a magnetic \nfield, is 4.7 for a Terfenol-D thickness of 2.51 mm, and 7.6 \nfor 1.3 mm. The increase nearly doubles. This is because \nthe Terfenol-D is equivalent to  a load on the transformer. \nThe smaller load results in a higher step-up ratio. Rela-\ntively, the resonant frequency increases with a near linear \nrelationship to the magnetic field except at the low magnetic \nfield levels, which is caused by the complex magnetoelec-\ntric properties near the resonant frequency [17]. \nThe combining of the direct and converse magnetoelec-\ntric effects caused the step-up ratio of the magnetoelectric \ncomposite transformer to be adjusted by the magnetic field. \nAfter applying an AC voltage on the input port of the trans-\nformer, an amplified signal was produced due to the ampli-\nfying effect. At the same time, magnetization is induced due \nto the converse magnetoelectric effect. The magnetization \nproduces a voltage at the output port due to the direct mag-\nnetoelectric effect, which is s uperimposed on the amplified \nsignal. Therefore, the step-up ratio of the transformer can be \nadjusted by the magnetic field because the magnetoelectric \ncoupling varies under different magnetic fields. \nThe magnetization was induced with the piezoelectric \nmaterial polarized across the width and the magnetostrictive \nmaterial magnetized along the length. Thus, the converse \nmagnetoelectric coefficient is [22] \n33, 31,3\n2\n33 33 33, 11\n(1 )d ,d[ ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ]\nmp\nTH E\nmTL\nnn d dH\nEn s k n sμ−\n−= −− +        ( 1 )  \nwhere n is the geometric thickness ratio of the piezoelectric \nlayer to the total thickness of the laminate; 11\nE\ns  and 33\nHs  \nare the elastic compliances of  the piezoelectric and magne-\ntostrictive layers; k31,m and 33\nTμ  are the electromechanical \ncoefficient and magnetic permeability of piezomagnetic \nphase under stress; d\n31,p and d31,m are the piezoelectric and \npiezomagnetic coefficients. When both the magnetic field \nand polarized directions are along the length, the direct  \n \nFigure 3   Variation of the voltage step-up ratio of the sample and the \nresonant frequency with magnetic fiel ds for different thicknesses of the \nTerfenol-D layer. \nmagnetoelectric coefficient is [22,23] \n33, 33,\n2\n3 33 33 33, 33\n(1 )d ,d [( 1 ) ( 1 ) ]\nmp\nEE H\npLL\nnn d dE\nH ns k n sε−\n−= −+ −        ( 2 )  \nwhere 33\nEs  and 33\nHs  are the elastic compliances of the pie-\nzoelectric and magnetostrictive layers; k31,p and 33\nEε  are the \nelectromechanical coefficient and dielectric constant of \npiezoelectric phase. \nSimilar to the permittivity and magnetic permeability, the \ntwo parameters of the magnetoelectric modulus and phasic \ndifference have been used to describe the complete magne-\ntoelectric characteristics in th e experiments [8,9,15,20]. \nHowever, while the magnetoelectric modulus was discussed \nin theory, the phasic diff erence was not covered [22–25]. In \nthis study, both the magnetoelectric modulus and phasic \ndifference are important beca use the magnetoelectric volt-\nage superimposes on th e amplifying signal. d31,p and d33,p \nhave opposite signs. There are anti-phasic differences be-\ntween the input voltage and the voltage produced through \nthe converse and direct magnetoelectric effects. Thus, the \noutput voltage reduces after the superimposition of the \nmagnetoelectric signal; as a resu lt, the voltage step-up ratio \nis reduced as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, stronger mag-\nnetoelectric coupling results in a smaller voltage step-up \nratio. \nThe direct and converse magnetoelectric effects share the \nsame characteristics with the in crease in the bias magnetic \nfield, i.e., increase an d then decrease [8,17 –21]. The mag-\nnetic field corresponding to the maximum magnetoelectric \ncoupling relates to the demagnetization factor or the shape \nof the magnetic layer. The maximum magnetoelectric cou-\npling is at about 250 Oe for the Terfenol-D shape in this \nstudy [17]. Therefore, the mini mal step-up ratio occurs at a \nmagnetic field of 250 Oe. \n3  Conclusions \nIn summary, a magnetoelectri c composite transformer was \nprepared by combining a Terfenol-D slice and a Rosen-type \ntransformer. The voltage step -up ratio of the transformer \nwas adjusted by changing the bias magnetic field based on \nthe direct and converse magne toelectric effects. The de-\npendence of the voltage step-up ratio on the magnetic field \nshared similar behavior to tr ansformers with different Ter-\nfenol-D thicknesses, i.e., decreased at first and then in-\ncreased with the increase in the magnetic field. The magne-\ntoelectric composite transforme r provides a method for the \napplication of magnetoelectric materials. \nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of \nChina (50772065, 50972088) and Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of \nElectronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, UESTC (KFJJ200809). \n Lü L, et al.
