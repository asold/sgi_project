INTRODUCTION\nThe performance of any transformer mainly depends on\ntheir insulation condition. During the operational life of\ntransformer, various stresses like mechanical, electrical and\nenvironmental reflect the adverse effect on insulation and\nsometimes causing the permanent failure of transformer [1].\nTherefore, regular monitoring of insulation is needed for\ncontinuous operation of power transformer [2], [3]. Available\nliterature shows various methods for assessing the insulation\ncondition. Some of them are based on chemical diagnosis\nlike Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), Degree of Polymeriza-\ntion (DP) etc. [2]. Due to various limitations of above said\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Mira Naftaly\n.\nmethods, these methods are not widely used on transformer\noperating in field [4]. Researchers show that Polarization\nDepolarization Current (PDC) analysis technique is contin-\nuously gaining popularity in the field of insulation diagnosis\n[5]. Available literature assumes that Classical Debye Model\n(CDM) is a good choice for analyzing the PDC data that\nprovides the reliable information regarding insulation con-\ndition [6]. Conventional Debye Model (CDM) is preferable\nbecause it does not consider the effect of temperature gradient\nthat exists across the length of insulation. The parameter\nidentification of Cole - Cole model requires an intensive\niterative method, which is a time taking process. There is\nno direct relation between Cole - Cole model parameter\nwith moisture content. Such model parameters are related\nto paper conductivity. Existing literature reported that paper\n56858\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.\nFor more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ VOLUME 11, 2023\nA. Kumar et al.: Importance of Depolarization Current in the Diagnosis of Oil-Paper Insulation\nconductivity is related to moisture. Hence, indirect prediction\nof moisture is possible using Cole - Cole model, due to\nwhich more errors can be introduce in the system. On the\nother hand, CDM parameters are directly related to moisture\nprediction is also less than 5 percent. Hence in the present\nwork, CDM is used to predict moisture and tanδ. Various\nperformance parameters like %tanδ, %pm, Polarization index\n(PI), Dielectric adsorption ratio (DAR) have also been esti-\nmated from the CDM model [7]. These parameters indicate\nthe insulation condition. The formulation of CDM is repre-\nsented by the parallel combination of series R-C branches.\nThe accuracy of this method depends on CDM parameters\nresulted from relaxation current. Thus, it can be said that the\nreliability of information from the CDM is mainly depends\non the measured PDC data [8]. Sometimes during field mea-\nsurement, it is noticed that equipment unable to record the\nproper polarization current even under the application of dc\nvoltage [9]. Researchers also reported [6] that this situation\narises due to lose or improper connections. This situation\ncannot be avoided due to involvement of human factor. It is\nreported in [7] and [10] that when the polarization current\nmeasured just after rectifying the loose connection, the effect\nof residual dipole energy also affects the measured data.\nThese residual dipoles energy in the system appears during\nthe improper phase measurement under the application of\ncharging voltage. Another problem that arises during field\nmeasurement is effect of low frequency noise [11]. The\nother energized equipment near the unit being tested may\ncreate such issue. In addition to this, other sources like\nslow variation in environmental condition (especially ambi-\nent temperature) at the time of measurement [12]. Due to\nsuch factors, the recorded polarization current may lose its\nmonotonically decreasing trend. Therefore, it is difficult to\nformulate insulation model using such noisy data and hence\nprediction of insulation sensitive performance parameters.\nOn the other hand, these issues do not have significant effects\non depolarization current. A given dielectric can only store\na fixed amount of energy. In the presence of residual dipole\nenergy, less amount of energy will enter into the dielectric\nduring polarization phase [13]. Irrespective of presence or\nabsence of residual energy, the amount of energy content\npresent within the insulation after the polarization phase is\nover will always be constant. Hence, the presence of residual\nenergy influences only the profile of polarization current\ndata without significantly affecting the depolarization cur-\nrent. In the literature [11], [14], in the presence of residual\nenergy, if the performance parameters are calculated using\npolarization current then proper compensation (for Er) is\nrequired. On the other hand, if parameters are estimated using\ndepolarization current then no compensation is required for\nestimation of various performance parameters.\nThe analysis in this paper shows that CDM formulation\nthrough depolarization current is more accurate as this cur-\nrent is not much more affected by residual charge and other\nproblems that encountered during field measurement. Thus,\nin situation where polarization current is affected by practical\nFIGURE 1. (a) Schematic top view of laboratory sample (A) strips\npressboard to isolate HV and LV winding (B) Copper sheets folded on\nKraft paper (C) Pressboard cylinder (D) folded copper foil; (b) laboratory\nprepared sample.\nfield issues like residual charge, low or high frequency\nnoise, changing of ambient temperature etc., the performance\nparameters evaluation from depolarization current provides\nreliable information regarding insulation instead of polariza-\ntion current. Firstly, the analysis is performed on laboratory\nsample showing residual charge effect and then on real life\ntransformer whose polarization current is affected by low\nfrequency noise. A number of in-situ transformers have been\ntested. During testing, it is observed that the depolarization\ncurrent does not get affected low frequency noise and tem-\nperature variation.\nII. SAMPLE CONSTRUCTION\nFor analysis purpose and the measurement in the laboratory\nsamples have been constructed. Initially the sample structure\nbegin with a pressboard cylinder (having height 10 cm and\ndiameter 50 cm). The pressboard is made up of a 2 mm thick\npressboard and provides internal support to the sample. Two\ncopper foils that have been wrapped in Kraft paper are used\nto imitate low and high voltage windings. Fig. 1a shows the\nschematic diagram of the sample constructed in the labora-\ntory. In Fig. 1a, B, D represents the copper sheets overlap\nwith Kraft paper C represents the inner pressboard cylinder\nwhile D is the pressboard strips used to isolate HV and LV\nwindings. Fig. 1b shows the finally constructed structure of\nlaboratory sample for pre-measurement processing.\nIn order to dry the prepared samples, these samples are\nput in oven with a temperature control. The heater used to\ndry the samples at 80 ◦C for more than 96 hours is shown\nin Fig. 2. After this drying procedure, the sample is left in\nopen for absorbing the requisite amount of moisture content\nfrom the environment. Once these samples have soak up the\npredetermined moisture (by weight). The samples are put\ninside the 1.5 litres of mineral oil-filled steel container. It is\nbelieved that after the samples have been dipped into the\nsteel container, all of the moisture has been absorbed. For\nPolarization and Depolarization current (PDC) measurement\nthe setup has been prepared in the laboratory as shown in\nFig. 3. Fig. 3 shows the PDC measurement setup prepared\nin High Tension Laboratory, Jadavpur University.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56859\nA. Kumar et al.: Importance of Depolarization Current in the Diagnosis of Oil-Paper Insulation\nTABLE 1. Technical Specification of Oven.\nThe polarization current discussed above can be modeled\nby (1).\nipol (t) = C0V (σr\nε0\n+ ε∞δ(t) + f (t)) (1)\nwhere ε0 is permittivity of vacuum, δ(t) is the delta function\narises due to sudden application of dc excitation voltage at\nt = t0, f (t) is a monotonically decreasing dielectric response\nfunction, and V is the applied voltage.\nIn Fig. 4, 0 ⩽ t ⩽ tc, is the is the time dura-\ntion for which the voltage is applied across the test sam-\nple. Dielectric response function describes the basic mem-\nory properties of any dielectric material and has the capa-\nbility to provide reliable information about the dielectric\nmaterial [6]. Therefore, at present, modeling of f (t) is a\nmajor concern for researchers. Available literature shows\nthat modeling of f (t) and hence the behavior of insulation\nis possible using simple Resistive-capacitive network [2].\nNumerous similar resistive-capacitive networks for simulat-\ning the response function of insulation have been described\nby researchers [6]. The Conventional Debye Model (CDM),\namong these, is arguably the most well-known [2]. The\nparallel combination of series resistive-capacitive elements\nmakes up the CDM. Concerned insulation has a number of\ndipole groups with varying relaxation periods. The Ri − Ci\nbranches of CDM (shown in Fig. 5) are used to represent these\nrandomly oriented groups, and they have an associated time\nconstant denoted by τi = Ri − Ci.\nThis model analyzes the characteristics of insulation by\nconsidering the entire insulation as black box. Hence, without\nknowing the actual geometry of insulation structure, it can\nbe used to analyze the data [2], [9]. In Fig. 5, the geomet-\nric capacitance and dc insulation resistance are denoted by\nR0 and C0, respectively.\nIII. ASSESSMENT OF INSULATION CONDITION USING\nPDC ANAYSIS\nDuring polarization current measurement, dc voltage is\nimpressed across the insulating material under test [15].\nOn application of dc step field, the insulating material’s inter-\nnal dipoles began to rotate in the direction of the applied field,\nand the polarization process starts. This leads to generation of\npolarization current through material. During depolarization\ncurrent measurement, the supply terminal is shorted [16].\nFIGURE 2. (a) Temperature Controlled Oven, (b) Drying process of\nsamples in the oven, (c) Impregnation process of samples with\ntransformer oil.\nFIGURE 3. Laboratory setup for PDC measurement.\nFIGURE 4. Typical profile of PDC data.\nTherefore, Depolarization current flows through insulation\nas the dipoles once more align with their initial orientation.\nFig. 4 shows the typical profile of polarization and depolar-\nization current (PDC) [8], [13]. Keithley 6517B Electrometer\nis used for field test to get data from real-life transformer.\nIt is worth mentioning here from [14], that samples kept\nat any fixed temperature for about 24 hours is enough for\nthe samples to reach thermal equilibrium. Here, 1000 V\ndc is used as excitation voltage during polarization current\n56860 VOLUME 11, 2023\nA. Kumar et al.: Importance of Depolarization Current in the Diagnosis of Oil-Paper Insulation\nFIGURE 5. Conventional Debye Model Structure.\nmeasurement phase. Various aging-sensitive Parameters may\nbe investigated to forecast the insulation status of transform-\ners, according to the literature currently available (transfer\nfunction zero, pole) estimated from Debye Model derived\nbased on PDC data [13], [17]. It is reported in [10] that\nperformance parameters of transformer insulation like tanδ,\n%pm hold favorable relationship with the transfer function\nzeros as (2) and (3).\n% tan δ = 0.4423 + 0.0457 × ln (|Z1|) (2)\n%pm = 1.718 + 0.418 × ln (|Z1|) (3)\nwhere, Z1 is the system’s zero that is furthest from the ori-\ngin in the LHS of the s-plane. Therefore, %tanδ and %pm\nof transformer insulation can be estimated once the Z1 is\nderived from PDC data. Other Parameters, such as the Dielec-\ntric Absorption Ratio (DAR), which measures the insulation\nresistance at 60 seconds to 30 seconds, and the Polariza-\ntion Index (PI), which measures the insulation resistance at\n600 seconds to 60 seconds, are also used to determine the\nstate of the insulation. These parameters can be obtained\ndirectly from the measured PDC data [8]. Therefore, if the\npolarization current is affected by the residual dipole energy\nor any other field issues, the above described performance\nparameters wrong information regarding the insulation condi-\ntion. As during depolarization measurement phase there is no\nsuch problem thus it is better to use depolarization current for\nthe formulation of Debye model and estimation of insulation\nsensitive parameters [18], [19]. To simulate a situation where\na known amount of residual charge is present in the insulation,\npolarization current from a sample (which is not affected by\nresidual energy) is considered. The performance parameters\nfor the sample insulation are identified using equation (2) and\n(3) [20]. After this a controlled amount of dipole energy,\nthe insulation model includes a non-zero beginning condition\nfor the branch capacitances of CDM. Thereafter, polariza-\ntion current of the sample (affected by residual energy) is\nsimulated using the insulation model having nonzero initial\ncondition. Fig. 6 represent the Debye model affected by\nresidual dipole energy [11], [14]. To reduce the complexity\nin calculation the nonzero initial condition in sub-branches is\nrepresented by voltage source.\nA. APPLICATION TO THE LABORATORY SAMPLE\nThe suggested method is tested on sample prepared in the\nlaboratory. After simulating the dipole energy for different\ntime instant various performance parameters are calculated\nFIGURE 6. Conventional Debye Model affected by dipole energy.\nFIGURE 7.

Fig. 7 pictorially\nrepresent the polarization current measured from sample is\naffected by dipole energy for various time instants. Different\npolarization current shown in Fig. 7 are measured from 10s\nto 60s. Different performance parameters like tanδ, %pm\nand DAR are calculated from polarization current contains\ndifferent residual dipole energy [21].\nThe calculated values of DAR for sample with\npaper-moisture content of 3.2% and 1%, are presented in\nTable 2 and Table 3, respectively. The values of performance\nparameters calculated from polarization current of samples\n(measured at different instant of time without discharging the\nsamples) and depolarization current have been tested.\nTable4 displays the performance parameter values derived\nfrom the sample polarization current (measured at differ-\nent instant of time without discharging the samples) and\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56861\nA.

Polarization current affected by low frequency noise.\nresults regarding insulation condition. From Table 4 to\nTable 6, it is clear that the calculated values of parameters\nfrom unaffected polarization current and depolarization are\nvery much closer to each other. Thus, the suggested method is\napplicable where polarization currents are affected by resid-\nual charge or low frequency noise.\nB. APPLICATION TO REAL LIFE POWER TRANSFORMER\n(200 MVA, 420 kV)\n1) EFFECT OF LOW FREQUENCY NOISE ON RECORDED\nPOLARIZATION PROFILE\nOnce the suggested method is tested on laboratory sample,\nthe method is also applied on the data collected from the\nreal-life transformer for validation purpose. It is understood\nthat due to very low magnitude of the polarization current,\nit is very susceptible to noise during field measurements [22].\nOther energized equipment and additional circuitry present\nin the vicinity of the unit being tested tend to contribute\nto the PDC noise [23]. As relaxation current data has a\nmonotonically decreasing profile, it is practically difficult to\ndesign a filter to detect and reject very low frequency noise.\nThis low frequency noise affects the measured polarization\ncurrent [20], [24]. In this case, polarization current is not\nfollowing the exponential decaying profile. In order to esti-\nmate the insulation sensitive parameters polarization current\nmust have monotonically decreasing exponential profile [6].\nFig. 8 shows the polarization current affected by low fre-\nquency noise (generally due to environmental factors) [25].\nWith such a noisy profile of polarization current it is not\npossible to estimate the reliable information regarding the\ninsulation condition. Fig. 9 shows the depolarization of same\ntransformer. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that depolarization\ncurrent is not affected by any noise. Thus, in such cases\nit is good to estimate the performance parameters from the\ndepolarization current rather than polarization current [26].\nTable 2 shows that comparison between the measured\nparameters and the parameters calculated by depolarization\ncurrent. Column 2 of Table 3 shows the measured parameters\nof concerned insulation while column 3 shows the parameters\nestimated using the depolarization current. It is clear from the\nresults that there is very less deviation between the measured\nand calculated values of performance parameters. Column\n56862 VOLUME 11, 2023\nA.

Measured and computed values of parameters.\nTABLE 8. Measured and computed values of parameters.\n4 depicts the error between the measured and calculates\nvalues of parameters. Overall from Table 3, it is clear that\nif polarization current of any transformer is either affected by\nresidual charge or noise (high or low frequency) then is such\ncase the analysis can be done with the help of depolarization\ncurrent [13].\n2) EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE VARIATION ON RECORDED\nPOLARIZATION PROFILE (167 MVA, 220 kV)\nOther issue which is commonly encountered during field\nrecording of polarization current from real transformer is the\neffect of change in ambient temperature. This variation is\nmainly due to environmental factors [27]. This change in\natmospheric temperature may create unbalancing with ther-\nmal equilibrium condition of testing equipment. It can be\nobserved from Fig. 10 that the recorded polarization current\ndata does not following monotonically decreasing profile and\napproaching increasing trend after a certain time. With such\ntemperature affected data formulation of insulation model is\nFIGURE 10. Polarization current affected by temperature variation.\nnot possible hence estimation of reliable performance param-\neters is not possible [28]. In such situation, performance\nparameters estimation is only possible with recorded depo-\nlarization current profile. However, few iterative techniques\nare available to compensate this practical issue. Using depo-\nlarization current data, it is possible to avoid such complex\niterative process to compensate the temperature effect on\npolarization current [29], [30]. Table 4 shows the values of\ndifferent performance parameters which are predicted using\ndepolarization current data. It is clear from Table 4 that the\npredicted values of such parameters are close to that of their\nmeasured value.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn the field measurement of PDC data, numerous practical\nproblems arise. Sometime even after application of dc voltage\nthe DAQ system is unable to record any data. After recti-\nfying the issues, when the dc voltage again applied across\ninsulation to measure data then there may be a possibility\nthat polarization current is affected by residual charge if\nsufficient discharging time is not provided. Another main\nissue that arises during field measurement is low frequency\nnoise and variation of ambient temperature affects the mea-\nsured polarization current due to which polarization does not\nfollow monotonically decreasing profile. In these situations,\ninformation regarding insulation from polarization current\ndoes not provide the reliable information. Thus, in such\ncases the depolarization current should be used for estimating\nthe insulation sensitive parameters. The suggested method is\nverified on sample prepared in laboratory and then applied\non real life in-situ transformer. It is found that the suggested\nmethod is successfully worked on sample as well as on real\nlife transformer.\nREFERENCES\n[1] W. S.
