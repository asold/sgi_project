However, the reliability of STs is one of the main\nchallenges, limiting its application. To improve the reliability\nof STs, it is proposed to control the power in a modular ST\narchitecture in order to control the remaining lifetime of its\nbuilding blocks. Therefore, unequal power sharing through the\ncells based on the remaining useful lifetime, known as power\nrouting, has been proposed for different converter topologies.\nHowever, existing literature has not investigated the impact of\npower routing on the ST on a system level. This paper focuses\non the design and implementation of lifetime-based power routing\ncontrol based on virtual resistances tailored for an ST consisting\nof Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) and Dual-Active Bridge (DAB)\nconverters.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe paradigm shift from fossil fuels to green-technologies\nin the energy production has altered the conventional power\nsystem network with higher share of renewable energy sources\nand electric vehicle charging stations. This has posed chal-\nlenges in the electrical distribution network with spatially\ndistributed generations and bidirectional power ﬂow. The ST\nis one promising solution to address the power ﬂow ﬂexibility\nwhile catering the requirements of changing grid scenarios\n[1]–[3]. However, expected lower reliability is one of the key\nchallenges of the ST compared with the conventional low-\nfrequency transformer.\nThe power electronic devices and capacitors contribute to\nthe major failures in converter systems [4]. The paper focuses\non the failures due to semiconductors. The power cycling of\nthe devices resulting in thermal cycles is considered to be the\ncrucial factor for the aging of devices. The existing literature\nmainly focuses on device level and converter level reliability\nby actively controlling the thermal cycles by different methods\nsuch as switching frequency control, active gate drivers and\nmodulation techniques [5]–[7]. For improving the reliability\nof a modular converter system comprising of many cells, the\naging of the cells can be actively controlled by unequal sharing\nof the power depending on the remaining useful life of each\nmodule and thereby the system failure can be delayed [8]–\n[10]. However, the system level reliability study of a modular\npower converter system is scarce in the existing literature.\nThis work presents the impact of unequal power sharing on\nFig. 1: ST topology with CHB and DAB.\nthe reliability of the power electronic converters on a system\nlevel. The design and implementation of a reliability oriented\nsystem level design of the ST with the power routing strategy\nis investigated in this paper.\nSince the unequal power sharing for increased reliability\nhas different effects on different topologies, implementation\nof power routing for the ST consisting of various topologies\nis challenging. The paper proposes a virtual resistance based\nlifetime based control for the modular ST comprising of CHB\nconverter cells and DAB cells as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe section II introduces the concept of power routing to\nincrease the reliability of ST. Topology and the design of the\nlifetime-based power routing controller (PRC) is explained in\nsection III. The simulation results are discussed in section\nIV.

P OWER ROUTING FOR INCREASED RELIABILITY\nOne of the main challenges of the ST is the reliability\nand availability compared to the traditional low-frequency\ntransformer with expected lifetimes of 60 - 80 years. There-\nfore, a modular system with the capability to monitor the\nhealth of components is proposed. When a component fails,\nthe corresponding cell is sent back for maintenance and\nreplaced. Consequently, the ST is composed of modules with\ndifferent ages. According to the aging of the cells, the power\nis distributed among the cells to delay the processed-power\ndependent failures. The highly aged cells process less power\ncompared to the new ones and therefore the power dependent\naging can be controlled. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.\nThe junction temperature ﬂuctuations inﬂuence the aging\nand deterioration of the power modules as expressed in (1).\nHere, Nf denotes the number of thermal cycles to failure\ndepending on the thermal swing DT, average junction tem-\nperature Tj;av and the device dependent parameters a1, a2 and\nFig. 4: Replacement cycle in the repairable modular ST and\nuneven loading based on remaining estimated lifetime [11].\na3. The parameter a2 \u00195 makes Nf highly sensitive to junction\ntemperature variations [12].\nNf = a1(DT)a2 \u0001e\na3\nTj;av+273\u000eC (1)\nThe thermal cycles lead to fatigue and leads to bond-wire\nliftoff. For fatigue analysis, Miner’s rule can be applied to\ncalculate the accumulated damage using [13]\nDacc = å\nNi\nNf i\n(2)\nwhere Dacc is the accumulated damage, Ni the number of\ncycles and Nf ithe durability of the i-th stress range. When the\naccumulated damage becomes 1, the device fails. It is assumed\nthat the damage accumulates linearly.\nIII. T OPOLOGY AND CONTROLLER STRUCTURE\nA potential three-stage conﬁguration of the ST is shown in\nFig. 1. The CHB connects the Medium V oltage AC (MV AC)\nto Medium V oltage DC (MVDC) and DAB converts the\nMVDC to Low V oltage DC (LVDC) with medium frequency\ntransformer isolation. This section focuses on the controller\ndesign for CHB and DAB of the ST with the capability to route\nthe power based on the remaining useful lifetime (RUL). The\nFig. 1 shows the ST topology with CHB and DABs comprising\nof n units. Here, one CHB cell along with a DAB is considered\nas one unit.\nA. Control Scheme for CHB and DAB\nThe CHB rectiﬁer stage controls and shapes the input\nac current and controls the total MVDC-link voltage. The\ncontrol scheme for CHB is shown in Fig. 2. The current\nand voltage control is achieved through cascaded controller\nstructure with Proportional-Resonant (PR) controller and\nProportional-Integral (PI) controller respectively [14]. The\nFig. 3 shows the control scheme for power routing using\nthe CHB. The modulation index, m, produced by the PR\ncontroller is given to a PI-based Power Modulator to achieve\ndifferent power ﬂow through the DC-links of CHB. The\npower reference, P\u0003\ni , for each of the DC-links is computed\nthrough a power routing algorithm based on virtual resistors.\nA control scheme with output and input voltage control\nis adopted for the DAB. The input MVDC-link voltages\nare balanced by the DAB, which is critical for the stability\nwhile processing unequal power through each H-bridge of the\nCHB. For the output LVDC-link voltage control, a PI voltage\ncontroller is designed using pole-zero cancellation technique\n[15].\nB. Impact of Power Routing on CHB and DAB topology\nPower routing strategy has been implemented on the CHB\nin [9]. It is evident that the total losses of the power semicon-\nductors do not vary much with unequal power sharing for the\nCHB. For the selected IGBT in [9], even 80% unloading of on\ncell leads to only \u0019 5% decrease in the total losses. In general,\nsince the H-bridges in a CHB are connected in series, the\n \n0.40.50.60.70.80.910\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nPi/Pbal\nLoss (Normalized)\n \n \nIGBT\nDiode\nTotal\n(a)\n0.40.50.60.70.80.910\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nLoss (Normalized)\n \n \nIGBT\nDiode\nTotal\nP /Pi bal (b)\nFig. 5: Loss distribution of the power semiconductors in\nDABs of the ST (a) Unloaded cell primary side H-bridge (b)\nUnloaded cell secondary side H-bridge.\npower routing has limited effect on the device losses. However,\nthe loss distribution among the IGBTs and diodes is inﬂuenced\nby power routing resulting in \u0019 20% change in losses for 80%\nunbalance [9].\nTo evaluate the effect of unbalanced power sharing on the\nsemiconductor loss distribution in DABs, a simulation study\nis done in SIMULINK. The diode and IGBT losses of the\nprimary and secondary side H-bridges of DAB are analyzed\nfrom full load to 40% of full load condition. The results for\nthe primary (MVDC) and secondary (LVDC) active bridges\nare shown in Fig 5(a) and (b) respectively. The IGBT losses\non primary side and diode losses on secondary side dominate\nthe total losses due to the power ﬂow from MV to LV\nstage. The loss variation for unloading can be approximated\nas a linear function for simplicity. Therefore, by varying\nthe power sharing ratio among the DABs, the device losses\ncan be effectively inﬂuenced and consequently their junction\ntemperatures and the aging.\nC. Lifetime based power routing with virtual resistor\nTo conduct a lifetime analysis of the ST, a simpliﬁed electro-\nthermal model of a seven level CHB connected to three DABs\nare modeled in MATLAB. The model consist of electrical\nequations of CHB and DAB along with thermal models of\nthe semiconductor switches and the heatsink for calculating\nthe junction temperature of each device. The simpliﬁed model\nshortens the simulation time of electro-thermal circuits dras-\ntically, making lifetime studies of the order of many years\nfeasible to be simulated within reasonable time.\nFirst, the CHB and DAB are described with their electrical\nequations. Considering phase shift modulation for DAB cell i,\nthe power handled is given by\nPi =\nmdab;iV2\ndc;iDi(1 \u0000Di)Tsw\n2Li\n(3)\nwhere Pi is the power processed by DAB cell i, mdab;i is\nthe modulation index of DABi,Vdc;i is the MVDC link voltage,\nLi is the leakage inductance and Tsw is the switching time\nperiod. Depending on the operating power, duty cycle Di is\ncalculated and subsequently the primary iprim;i and secondary\ncurrents isec;i through the switches are also calculated [16]. The\nCHB Cell DAB Pri DAB Sec\nUnit 1\nUnit 2\nUnit n-1\nUnit n\nFig. 6: Equivalent circuit design of virtual resistor based power\nrouting in the ST with CHB and DAB.\nconduction loss for the switches are calculated with knowing\ntheir on-state resistance value ron and the switching losses,\nturn on Psw\u0000on;i and turn off Psw\u0000o f f;i losses, from their turn-\non Eon and turn-off Eo f fenergies and using the equations (4)\nand (5) respectively.\nPsw\u0000cond;i = 4(i2\nprim;i \u0001ron\u0000pri;i +i2\nsec;i \u0001ron\u0000sec;i) (4)\nPsw\u0000o f f;i = 4 fsw(Eo f f\u0000pri;i +Eo f f\u0000sec;i) (5)\nThe turn on losses for each DAB cell Psw\u0000on;i depends\non the Zero V oltage Switching condition and are calculated\naccordingly [16]. Finally, the total losses Psw;i for the given\noperation point can be computed by (7)\nPsw;i = Psw\u0000cond;i +Psw\u0000on;i +Psw\u0000o f f;i (6)\nSimilarly, the electrical equations of CHB is used to com-\npute the devices losses for the given operating point [17].\nThe thermal model consists of the thermal impedance of\njunction to case, case to heatsink and heatsink to ambient\nrepresented by a Cauer network. The junction temperature Tjun\nof the device can be calculated from\nTjun(t) =Zth; jun\u0000amb(t)\u0003Ploss(t)+ Tamb(t) (7)\nThe junction temperature measurement from the cells are\nused to calculate the accumulated damage ( Di) using rainﬂow\ncounting algorithm and Miner’s rule [13]. When the accu-\nmulated damage reaches unity, the power module attains it’s\nEnd of Life (EOL). Based on the accumulated damages of\nthe semiconductor modules, the power distribution is changed\nto delay the power dependent failures. The virtual resistance\nRvi; ie[1;n] is deﬁned as function of the accumulated damage\nof the respective units. The scheme for the implementation of\nthe power routing controller is shown in Fig. 3.\nTherefore, the higher the value of virtual resistance, the\nlower the power processed through each unit. For the imple-\nmentation of power routing, the converters are not oversized\nand when the system is operated under full load, the converters\nMission\nprofile\nConverter \nloading\nThermal\nloading\nRainflow \nCounting\n& Lifetime \nestimation\nPower \nRouting & \nLifetime \ncontrol\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100Temperature [°C]\ntime [min]\n0\n0.5\n1\nPower [pu]\ntime [min]0\n0.5\n1\ntime [min]\nFig. 7: Lifetime control block diagram with power routing.\nSymbol Description Value\ne (rms) Grid voltage (rms) 230V; 50Hz\nLg Filter inductance (MV side) 3:8mH\nVDC;1 =VDC;2 DC-link voltage reference 250V\nV0 DC-link voltage (LV side) 240V\nn MFT turn ratio 1 : 1\nfsw;CHB Switching frequency of the CHB3kHz\nfsw;DAB Switching frequency of the DAB12kHz\nTABLE I: System parameters\nprocess their rated power. The power routing strategy is active\nonly during the partial load operation. The design of the\nvirtual resistance for the CHB-DAB topology is illustrated\ngraphically in Fig. 6. The accumulated damages for each H-\nbridges of CHB and DAB can be calculated from the junction\ntemperature measurements and the virtual resistance can be\nmodeled as a function of accumulated damage. For simplicity,\na proportional relationship is considered (8):\nRvi;CHB=DAB µ Di;CHB=DAB (8)\nA weighted average of the virtual resistances of CHB and\nDAB modules in one power path is considered for the total\nvirtual resistance calculation as expressed in (9).\nRvi = wi;CHB;IGBT \u0001Rvi;CHB;IGBT +wi;CHB;DIODE \u0001Rvi;CHB;DIODE\n+wi;DAB \u0001max(Rvi;DABPri ;Rvi;DABSec ) ;ie[1;n] (9)\nThe weighting factors are calculated from the slope of the\nnormalized loss vs. power unbalance ratio for CHB and QAB.\nThus the impact of power routing on the different topologies\nare also considered to optimize the overall system reliability.\nThe total loss for the same power for both the active bridges\nof DAB (primary and secondary) are similar as shown in Fig.\n5. Therefore, the power routing strategy has similar impact\non both the bridges. The maximum virtual resistance value\namong the two-bridges is chosen for calculation (9) because\nboth bridges process the same power and the bridge with\nhigher virtual resistance is expected to fail ﬁrst. For the CHB,\nhowever, power routing has relatively little impact on the total\nlosses. But the loss distribution among IGBTs and diodes\ncan be affected by routing the power. For the power ﬂow\nfrom MV AC to MVDC, the diodes are more stressed than\nIGBTs. The damage accumulation of both IGBTs and diodes\nare considered for CHB.

S IMULATION RESULTS\nThe simulation results comprises of two parts: a) Validation\nof the control algorithm with simulation and b) Validation of\nthe impact of the virtual resistance based power routing on the\nlifetime of ST.\nA. Validation of Control Algorithm\nTo validate the performance of CHB and DAB control\nalgorithm with power routing controller, a simulation model of\nthe ST is developed as described in section III. The controller\ncontrols the output LVDC voltage while maintaining the CHB\ncapacitor voltages to their reference values. The power routing\ncontroller should be able to load the DABs with unequal power\naccording to their references without changing the output\nvoltage and CHB capacitor voltages. The controller has been\nvalidated with simulation for the system parameters given in\nthe table I. Fig. 8 (a) shows the dynamic behavior of CHB\nvoltage control for a step change in the CHB DC link reference\nvoltage VDC;re f at 0.8 s. At 1.1 s, the CHB DC link voltages\nhave a perturbation due to the step change of DAB output\nvoltage reference Vo;re f.

Validation of the impact of power routing on lifetime\nTo validate the effect of virtual resistor based power routing\non the lifetime of ST, an electro-thermal model of the ST\ncomprising of CHB and DAB with IGBTs and diodes along\nwith the heatsink is developed as described in section III.\nMission proﬁle of a grid is given as the input and based on the\njunction temperature calculation, the accumulated damages are\nevaluated with rainﬂow counting. The power sharing between\nthe units of ST are dynamically changed according to the\nvirtual resistor model developed in section III. For the proof of\nconcept, results of three units comprising of three CHB cells\nconnected to three DABs are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10.\nFig. 9 (a) and (b) shows the accumulated damage variation of\nthe cells over time with the proposed virtual resistance Power\nRouting Control (PRC) for the DABs and CHB respectively.\nThe accumulated damage of the DABs converge over time,\nresulting in the failure of the system at a single point in time\neven though they have different initial accumulated damages.\nThe progression of the accumulated damage of the system\nwithout PRC for the DABs and CHB is shown in Fig. 10 (a)\nand (b) respectively. It illustrates that one of the cells fails\nearlier than the others resulting in the total system failure.\nIn order to analyse the results more vividly, the RUL of the\nDAB and CHB with and without power routing are illustrated\nin the bar-graphs Fig. 11 (a) and (b) respectively.

There is an increase in the RUL of the CHB\nwith actively sharing the power between diode and IGBTs as\ndepicted in Fig. 11 (b). To sum up, the PRC strategy results in\nthe overall lifetime extension on a system level even though\nthe lifetime of some healthy module is decreased compared\nto normal operation. Moreover, the results conﬁrm that PRC\nstrategy has different impacts on CHB and DAB as expected.\nV. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nTo validate the proposed power routing control strategy,\na small scale prototype of a ﬁve level CHB connected to\ntwo DABs has been developed as illustrated in Fig. 13. The\nH-bridges of CHB and DAB are made with open-module\nDP25H1200T101616 from Danfoss to facilitate direct junction\ntemperature measurements. High speed infrared thermal cam-\nera is used to obtain the thermal image of the open module as\nshown in Fig. 16. The camera is controlled by an automatic\npositioning system for fast and accurate measurements. The\nsetup is controlled by the dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The\nparameters of the experimental setup is summarized in Table\nI.\nFig. 12: The experimental setup ( E1 - High Speed Thermal\nCamera, E2 - CHB and DABs, E3 - Open Module, E4 -\nOscilloscope, E5 - Thermal image.\n5 A/div\n100 V/div\nPower Routing ActivePower Routing Inactive\nFig. 13: ST with and without power routing showing the output\ncurrent of both DAB, ( io;1\u00002) and the output voltage ( vo).\nFunctioning of the power routing controller along the overall\ncontrol system is tested by changing the power distribution.\nThe overall power processed by the system is kept constant at\nPn = 2:2kW and the power references of the DABs are changed\nto PDAB;1 = 1:45kW and PDAB;2 = 0:75kW from equal power\nsharing. The output currents of DAB,1 ( io;1) and DAB,2 ( io;2)\nalong with voltage across the load resistor ( vo) are shown in\nFig. 13. When the power references are changed, io;1 and io;2\nchange accordingly while vo stays constant as expected. The\nDC-link voltages of the CHBs are controlled and kept equal\nto the reference value, even with the unequal power sharing.\nThe Fig.14 (a) and (b) show the output currents of DABs and\nthe output voltage clearly for both equal and unequal power\nsharing respectively. This validates the proper functioning of\nthe control scheme developed in section III.\nThe temperature change in the primary side of the DAB\nin both modules are measured during the equal and unequal\npower sharing. The results of the high speed infrared camera\nmeasurement for DAB cell 1 showing the temperature of the\nIGBTs is shown in Fig. 15. The results show a difference\n5 A/div\n100 V/div\n(a)\n5 A/div\n100 V/div\n50 µs/div\n(b)\nFig. 14: (a) The output currents of both DABs ( io;1\u00002) and\nthe load voltage ( vo) for equal power sharing (b) The output\ncurrents of both DABs ( io;1\u00002) and the load voltage ( vo) for\nunequal power sharing.\n4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7\n72\n74\n76\n78\n80\n82\n84\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\ntime [s]\nTemperature  [°C]\n76.68 °C\n81.45 °C\nPRC ActivePRC \nInactive\nFig. 15: Variation of primary side IGBT junction temperatures\nof the DAB cell 1 for a step change of \u0019 21% increase in\npower.\nof \u0019 4\u000eC in the junction temperature for 350 W change of\nthe power applied for 5 s.

The objective of\nthe experiment is validate the working of the designed power\nrouting controller and the effect on the junction temperature\nand consequently the aging. Fig. 16 (a) and (b) shows the\nthermal image of the open modules showing the temperature\ndistribution without and with power routing control respec-\ntively. It is clear that the power routing controller can inﬂuence\nthe junction temperature of the modules and thereby the stress\non the semiconductors in different cells of the ST.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nFor applications requiring very high reliability such as the\nST, advanced control strategies are necessary to increase the\nlifetime. The design and the implementation of the controller\nscheme for unequal sharing of power based on lifetime of\nthe power modules for the ST is presented in this paper. The\nimpact of power routing on different converter topologies is\ninvestigated and is considered for the design of the virtual\nresistors for the ST. Analytical results show an increase\nof \u0019 12% increase in the lifetime of the system with the\nproposed power routing strategy. The proof of concept of the\ndesigned control scheme is shown experimentally on a small-\nscale prototype with open IGBT modules. The effect of the\npower routing controller on the junction temperature of the\nST is measured experimentally to validate the concept. The\nexperimental results show that the control strategy can be used\nto actively control the lifetime of ST.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported in part by the European\nUnion/Interreg V-A Germany-Denmark, under PE:Region\nProject and in part by the European Research Council un-\nder the European Unions Seventh Framework Programme\n(FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n. 616344-HEART.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
