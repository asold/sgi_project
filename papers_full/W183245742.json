    "abstract": "To remove the environmental and safety hazards associated with power transformers, the authors have investigated&#13;\\nthe use of liquid nitrogen as a replacement for transformer oil. This paper details tests performed to determine new&#13;\\ndesign rules and efficiency expectations of liquid nitrogen filled power transformers (Enviro-Transformers). The&#13;\\ntests include dielectric strength testing of liquid nitrogen and mechanical strength testing of standard transformer&#13;\\ninsulating materials submerged in liquid nitrogen. Efficiency and dissipation factor tests were performed on two&#13;\\nindustry standard 10 kVA, 50 Hz, 11/0.24 kV single-phase transformers. One transformer was filled with oil and&#13;\\noperated at room temperature, the other was filled with liquid nitrogen and operated at 77 oK.",
