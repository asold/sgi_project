INTRODUCTION\nHard-switched pulse-width-modulated (PWM) converters\nsuch as the buck and boost converters cannot be operated at\nhigh frequency under continuous conduction mode (CCM)\nsince they suffer from high switching losses under high-\nfrequency operation. Hence, their switching frequency needs\nto be limited to achieve high efﬁciency, leading to lower\npower density [1]–[5]. Research has attempted to provide a\nsoft-switching capability for hard-switched converters; how-\never, solutions are mainly based on adding various auxiliary\ncircuits to the topology of the hard-switched converters, which\nincreases their complexity and cost [6]–[8].\nResonant converters are displacing traditional hard-\nswitched converters because they beneﬁt from soft-switching\ncapability inherently and can provide high efﬁciency at high\nfrequency operation [9]. Amongst resonant converters, the\ninterest in the LLC topology, shown in Fig. 1, has increased\nbecause of its excellent soft-switching performance, low volt-\nage stress of switching devices and integration of magnetic\ncomponents [10]–[12]. As shown in Fig. 1, an isolated LLC\nFIGURE 1. Topology of the half-bridge LLC resonant converter.\nconverter needs multiple magnetic components consisting of a\nseries (also known as “resonant”) inductor, a parallel inductor\nand a transformer.\nTo increase the power density and efﬁciency, and decrease\nthe cost of an LLC converter, its magnetic components can\nbe integrated into a single magnetic transformer. An auxiliary\nwinding can be added to the transformer for integration of\ntransformer and inductor cores [13]–[16]. In this structure,\nthe winding of the series inductor is coiled around one leg\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n26 VOLUME 3, 2022\nof transformer core and primary and secondary windings are\non other legs.\nAnother way to integrate the required series inductance into\nthe transformer is to produce a design-speciﬁc core geometry\nor add an auxiliary core to a standard-geometry transformer\nand merge either the primary winding or secondary winding\nwith the winding of series inductor [14], [17]–[20]. Even\nthough the required series inductance can be integrated into\nthe transformer using this method, this approach requires a\nnew, bespoke transformer core for each design.\nIn [21], the primary and secondary windings are looped\naround the outer-left and outer-right legs of the transformer\nand an air gap is inserted into the centre leg of the E-core to\nachieve a controllable leakage inductance. Although a simple\nmulti-layer PCB with minimal complexity can be used as\nthe windings, the transformer has a large footprint since the\nwindings extend outside the transformer core. In addition,\nthe AC resistance is high in this design, and leakage and\nmagnetising inductances are not decoupled and cannot be\ndesigned separately.\nA lower AC resistance and controllable leakage inductance\ncan be achieved with an interleaved or a semi-interleaved\nwindings structure and core shape of the transformer [22],\n[23]. However, the winding structure is complicated in these\napproaches and the leakage and magnetising inductances are\nnot decoupled and affect each other’s value which makes the\ndesign process more complicated. In addition, the windings\nare looped around the outer legs, leading to lower power\ndensity.\nThe leakage inductance of a typical wound-core trans-\nformer can be selected by design and used as the series induc-\ntance of the LLC topology [24]–[26]. However, ﬂexibility of\ndesign is limited in this method since the leakage inductance\nis mainly affected by the geometry of the core and windings\nand thus cannot be regulated for different values easily.\nSome magnetic sheets can be also added between layers of\nwindings to integrate the magnetic components by enhancing\nthe leakage inductance (as a result of increasing energy stored\nin the window area) [27]. However, this approach suffers from\nlower efﬁciency due to the high eddy-current losses in the\nwindings and low ﬂexibility in design. In addition, a high\nleakage inductance cannot be designed in this structure.\nAn LLC resonant converter with high series inductance can\nprovide high voltage gain within a narrow operating frequency\nrange, which is needed for applications with wide input volt-\nage range. Therefore, the increase of leakage inductance,\nwhich is the series (resonant) inductance in an LLC topology,\nis an important consideration in integrated transformers [27],\n[28]. Inserting a low-permeability magnetic shunt in the cen-\ntre of a planar transformer while its primary and secondary\nwindings are separated (by being located above and below\nthe magnetic shunt) can provide a high leakage inductance\nand provides greater and more precise control of its value\n[29]–[31]. This topology also beneﬁts from the advantages of\nplanar transformers, viz high power density, improved cooling\ncapability, modularity and manufacturing simplicity. In this\ntopology, all three magnetic components of an isolated LLC\nconverter can be integrated in a single planar transformer.\nEven though this structure enhances the leakage inductance\nand allows for its value to be estimated precisely, the inserted\nshunt must have a speciﬁc and unusually low permeability,\nleading the design and manufacturing to difﬁculty and higher\ncost.\nA new topology is suggested in [32]–[34] to overcome this\nproblem. These structures, are formed by interleaving highly\npermeable ferrite with thin plastic spacers to form segmental\nmagnetic shunts. Fig. 2(a) shows this topology when a two-\nsegment shunt is used and this topology with ﬁve-segment\nshunt can also be found in [32], [33]. In this structure, a\nshunt with the same bulk permeability as the conventional\ndesign (which uses a low-permeability shunt) is approximated\nby regulating the length of the air gaps between segments\nacross the high-permeability shunt. Although this structure\neliminates the need for shunts with speciﬁc permeabilities\nand dimensions, the inserted shunt has multiple segments and\nhas to be placed in between two E-cores which makes the\nimplementation difﬁcult.\nTo address this issue, a new structure shown in Fig. 2(b)\nis proposed in this paper. In the proposed topology, two solid\nshunts are placed on the front and back (x-y plane) of a\nplanar transformer while primary and secondary windings\nare separated by being located above and below the shunts\nsuch that some of the primary winding generated ﬂux is\nshunted away from the secondary winding in order to realise\nthe leakage inductance. The bulk permeability of the shunts\nis regulated by changing their distance from the core (ℓs).\nTherefore, not only does the proposed structure beneﬁt\nfrom using high-permeability materials for the shunts but\nits inserted shunts also do not need to be segmental and\ncan be located easier. The proposed structure is analysed\nand modelled and a design guideline is also provided.\nThe theoretical analysis is veriﬁed by comparison with\nﬁnite-element analysis (FEA) simulation and experimental\nmeasurements. The AC resistance analysis and efﬁciency\ncomparison for the proposed structure and a recent structure\nwith inserted-segmental-shunt presented in [32], [33] are\nprovided. In addition, in order to examine the performance\nof the proposed structure in practice, an isolated LLC\nresonant converter using the proposed integrated transformer\nis implemented and investigated. The prototype proves that\nthe proposed structure can integrate all three magnetic com-\nponents of an LLC converter in a single planar transformer.\nThe paper is organised as follows: the modelling of the pro-\nposed inserted-solid-shunt integrated transformer is presented\nin Section II. In Section III, a simulation study is provided\nto show the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Experimen-\ntal results are provided in Section IV to validate theoretical\nand ﬁnite-element analyses and integration capability of the\nproposed structure. The conclusion of the work is ﬁnally pre-\nsented in Section V.\nVOLUME 3, 2022 27\nANSARI ET AL.: FULL Y-INTEGRATED SOLID SHUNT PLANAR TRANSFORMER FOR LLC RESONANT CONVERTERS\nFIGURE 2.

PROPOSED INTEGRATED MAGNETIC TRANSFORMERS\nThe topology of an inserted-segmental-shunt integrated planar\ntransformer presented in [32], [33] and its reluctance model\nare shown in Figs. 2(a) and (c), respectively. As shown, a\nsegmental shunt is inserted between the E-cores in line with\nair gap, and the primary and secondary windings are sepa-\nrated by being placed above and below the segmental shunt.\nIn this topology, the leakage inductance can be regulated\nby changing the thickness of the shunt, tsh, and the shunt\nair gap length, ℓs, and the magnetising inductance can be\nregulated by air gap length, ℓg, separation between the E-\ncores. This topology guarantees a high leakage inductance\nand accurate estimation of its value. However, the difﬁculty\nwith this topology is locating the segmental shunt in be-\ntween the E cores and requiring a segmental shunt (mini-\nmum two segments), which results in manufacturing difﬁ-\nculty. To address this issue, a new topology for the integrated\ntransformer is proposed, which beneﬁts from overlaying the\nsolid shunt across the E-core air gap and thereby simplifying\nmanufacture.\nThe schematic of the proposed topology and its reluctance\nmodel are shown in Figs. 2(b) and (d), respectively. In the\nproposed topology, two solid shunts are placed on the front\nand back of a planar transformer and between the primary and\nsecondary windings which are separated by being located at\nFIGURE 3.

The air gap\nℓg is inserted in between the E-cores to regulate magnetising\ninductance and the air gapℓs is added in between the shunts\nand E-cores to regulate the leakage inductance. As shown in\nFig. 2, the proposed topology provides the same reluctance\n28 VOLUME 3, 2022\nFIGURE 4. The calculated leakage and magnetising inductance versus thickness of the shunt.

However, manufacturing a solid\nshunt from low-permeability materials (e.g., a powder core) is\nharder and more expensive than manufacturing a solid shunt\nbased on high-permeability materials like ferrite. In addition,\nlow-permeability magnetics have temperature-dependent per-\nmeability, leading to unstable leakage inductance.\nIn the following, the modelling of the proposed structure\nis discussed for estimation of the leakage and magnetising\ninductances.\nEquation (1) can be used to calculate the leakage induc-\ntance, Llk .\nE = 1\n2\n∫∫∫\nV\nBH dV = 1\n2 LlkI2\nP (1)\nwhere V is the cuboid that incorporates the magnetic shunt,\nwindows area and windings,IP is the RMS of primary current,\nB is the ﬂux density andH is the magnetic ﬁeld intensity.\nFrom (1), to calculate the leakage inductance, the energy\nstored in the windows area, and the primary and secondary\nwindings, alongside the inserted shunts need to be calculated.\nTherefore, the energy stored in each part is calculated sepa-\nrately in the following and then the total leakage inductance\ncan be obtained by summation of energies and from (1).\nA.

On the other hand, the\nleakage inductance is mainly affected by the distance between\nshunts and cores (ℓs) and also the thickness of the shunt\n(tsh). Hence, in the proposed structure, the leakage and mag-\nnetising inductances are decoupled from each other and can\nbe regulated separately, leading the design process to higher\nﬂexibility.\nThe leakage inductance distribution (between shunt, air and\nwinding) of the proposed integrated transformer for different\nthicknesses of the shunt (tsh) and distances from shunts to\ncores (ℓs) are shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b), respectively. As\nshown, the leakage inductance (Llk) is mainly affected by\nshunt dimensions andℓs. The leakage inductance, caused by\nt h ew i n d o wa r e a(Llk−air) and windings (Llk−winding), is only\naffected by the geometries of the core and PCB windings.\nThe characteristics of the proposed integrated transformer\nare now fully investigated and it is shown that the transformer\ncan be designed for most reasonable speciﬁcations of leak-\nage and magnetising inductances. It does not need any low-\npermeability materials or segmental shunts. Therefore, the\nproposed transformer is a great candidate for use in an LLC\nresonant converter where it can integrate the magnetic compo-\nnents into only a single transformer. In the following, the op-\neration of the proposed transformer when it is designed to be\nused in a typical LLC resonant converter is investigated and its\nmodelling is veriﬁed by simulation and experimental results.\nIII. SIMULATION RESULTS\nTo verify the theoretical analysis presented in Section II, FEA\nsimulation of the proposed integrated transformer is provided.\nTherefore, an integrated transformer is designed and its spec-\niﬁcation is presented in Table 1. The leakage and magnetising\ninductances and the turns ratio of the designed transformer\nare selected according to the speciﬁcation of an exemplar iso-\nlated LLC resonant converter presented in Table 3. The tran-\nformer core (E32/6/20/R-3F4) is selected based on the design\nguidlines outlined by core manufacturer in its catalogue [35],\nwhich provides charts indicating the appropriate core accord-\ning to the stored energy and operating frequency.

In addition, the windings are designed\nconsidering the dimensions, skin effect, their root-mean-\nsquare (RMS) currents and the difﬁculty of manufacturing.\nThe magnetic ﬁeld intensity and ﬂux density vectors for the\nproposed integrated transformer, while it is used in an LLC\nconverter with speciﬁcation presented in Table III, are shown\nin Figs. 6(a) and (b), respectively. According to Fig. 6, the\nmagnetic ﬁeld intensity and ﬂux density vectors are dominant\nin the shunts and their air gaps (ℓs) rather than window area\nand PCB windings. The leakage ﬂux and, therefore, induc-\ntance is mainly caused by the shunts. In addition, since the\nmagnetic ﬁeld intensity is highest in the core air gap (ℓg),\nthe magnetising inductance is mainly affected by ℓg.T h e\nleakage and magnetising inductances versus thickness of the\nshunt (tsh) and transformer air gap (ℓg) obtained from (16) and\n(22) and measured by FEA simulation are presented for the\nproposed topology in Figs. 7(a) and (b), respectively.

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\nTo verify theoretical analysis and simulation results, an\nintegrated transformer based on the proposed structure with\nspeciﬁcation presented in Table I is built and its prototype\nis shown in Fig. 9. In addition, a recent proposed integrated\ntransformer with inserted-segmental-shunt presented in [32],\n[33] is built with the same speciﬁcation and is compared with\nthe proposed topology, shown in Fig. 9.\nThe measured leakage and magnetising inductances of the\nproposed topology at 200 kHz measured by an Omicron Bode\n100 analyser are shown in Table 2. The measured values are\nclose to the values obtained by modelling and simulation re-\nsults. In addition, the AC resistance, primary self-inductance\nand leakage inductance versus frequency for the proposed\ntopology and the segmental shunt topology are shown in\nFigs. 10(a) and (b), respectively. The measurement was car-\nried out by the precision impedance analyser Omicron Bode\n100 while the windings and shunt were located inside the\nplanar cores. As shown in Fig. 10, both transformers have\nsimilar magnetising and leakage inductances. However, the\nAC resistance of the topology with inserted segmental shunt is\nhigher than the proposed topology because of its high fringing\nlosses (as mentioned in [32], [33]). As seen in Fig. 2, in the\nproposed topology, the air-gaps of the shunt (labelledℓs)a r e\nfurther from the windings, reducing their coupling with the\nfringing ﬁeld and hence reducing losses. In the segmental\ntopology, the air gaps are between the lower and upper parts of\nthe winding and therefore have greater coupling and therefore\ngreater losses.\nTo verify the performance of the proposed integrated trans-\nformer in practice, an LLC resonant converter is implemented\nwith the speciﬁcation presented in Table 3 calculated accord-\ning to the design procedure outlined in [36], as shown in\nFig. 11. In this design, the series and parallel inductances are\nintegrated into the transformer. The waveforms of the con-\nverter operating at 210 kHz using (a) the proposed topology\nand (b) the topology with inserted-segmental-shunt are shown\nin Fig. 12. It can be seen that the switches are turned on at\nFIGURE 13. Efﬁciency of the designed LLC converter without the rectiﬁer\nstage using the proposed inserted-solid-shunt and conventional\ninserted-segmental-shunt integrated transformers.\nFIGURE 14. Thermal image of the transformer. (a) Proposed topology. (b)\nInserted-segmental-shunt topology.\nzero voltage (ZVS) because the switch gate turns on after its\ndrain-source voltage drops to zero.\nThe efﬁciency of the implemented LLC converter using\nthe proposed integrated transformer and inserted-segmental-\nshunt integrated transformer are shown in Fig. 13 for different\noutput powers. It can be seen that, since the topology with\ninserted-segmental-shunt suffers from higher AC resistance,\nit has a lower efﬁciency compared to the proposed topology.\nThe efﬁciency of the converter is evaluated after removing\nthe rectiﬁer stage from the circuit since the losses from an\nasynchronous rectiﬁer are higher than losses in the magnetics.\nRectiﬁer design is not the focus of this work and thus the\nrectiﬁer is not optimized.\nThermal images of the proposed topology and inserted-\nsegmental-shunt transformer at nominal operating conditions\nare shown in Figs. 14(a) and (b), respectively. It can be seen\nVOLUME 3, 2022 33\nANSARI ET AL.: FULL Y-INTEGRATED SOLID SHUNT PLANAR TRANSFORMER FOR LLC RESONANT CONVERTERS\nthat the proposed transformer has a lower temperature (about\n2 °C) compared to the inserted-segmental-shunt transformer\nsince it beneﬁts from lower losses. In addition, the windings\nhave a higher temperature compared to the cores since they\nhave higher losses, which conﬁrms the loss distribution pre-\nsented in Fig. 8.\nIt should be noted that the application of the proposed inte-\ngrated transformer can be extended to other converters such\nas the phase-shifted full-bridge converters and dual-active-\nbridge converters and is not only restricted to the LLC res-\nonant converter.\nTo sum up, not only does the proposed shunt-inserted in-\ntegrated transformer address the main issues of the segmental\nshunt topology, but it also provides a higher efﬁciency without\nfundamentally redesigning the planar transformer or its asso-\nciated converter.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA new topology for the shunt-inserted integrated planar trans-\nformers is proposed. The inserted shunts are solid in the pro-\nposed topology, leading to easier manufacturing compared to\nsegmental shunt topology. In addition, the shunts are based on\nhigh-permeability materials like ferrite, which is widely avail-\nable in the market with different sizes and lower price. There-\nfore, the proposed structure beneﬁts from both advantages of\nthe high-permeability segmental shunt and low-permeability\none-segment shunt topologies. The analysis and modelling\nof the proposed structure are presented. The leakage and\nmagnetising inductances are decoupled from each other in\nthe proposed structure and can be regulated separately, lead-\ning to a ﬂexible design process. FEA simulation and experi-\nmental implementation are provided to verify the theoretical\nanalysis. In addition, according to the presented results, the\nproposed topology can provide a higher efﬁciency compared\nto the inserted-segmental-shunt topology. An LLC resonant\nconverter is also implemented to examine the performance of\nthe proposed integrated transformer in practice. The prototype\nshows that the proposed topology can integrate all the three\nmagnetic components of the LLC converter into a single pla-\nnar transformer.\nREFERENCES\n[1] K. Nathan, S. Ghosh, Y .
