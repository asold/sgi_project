These chemicals \nwere considered commercially valuable and produced in \nlarge quantities for the period 1929 to 1976. The total \nworldwide production through 1976 has been estimated to \nbe 6.1 x 108 kg, of which about 93% were produced by \nMonsanto corporation in the United States.1 Commercial \nPCB mixtures by Monsanto corporation were marketed \nunder the registered trade-mark of Aroclor and used in a \nwide variety of applications, including dielectric fluids in \ntransformers and capacitors, heat transfer fluids, plasticizers, \nlubricant inks, paint additives, and adhesives.2-5 However, \ntheir physicochemical properties related with the resistance \nto breakdown by acids, bases, heat, and hydrolysis have led \nthese chemicals to ubiquitous environmental pollutants. Not \nsurprisingly, they have been identified in almost every \ncompartment of the global ecosystem.6-9\nA PCB-containing product class used in transformers is \naskarel. The most common transformer askarel was mainly \nconsisted of 60% Aroclor 1260/40% trichlorobenzene (type \nA) and 70% Aroclor 1254/30% trichlorobenzene (type B).9 \nIt was reported that approximately 300,000 waste trans­\nformers have been discharged in Korea since 2000. In addi­\ntion, a large number of transformers with the cross-contamin­\nation of mineral oil with PCBs still remain in operation. As a \nparty to an agreement of Stockholm on May 17, 2005 by the \nUnited Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the Korean \ngovernment recently passed the Act of the Waste Manage­\nment, which specifically regulates the PCB-contaminated \nmaterials. The regulation prohibited manufacture, processing, \ncommercial distribution or use of PCBs in open system and \npromulgated that such waste transformers with PCB concen­\ntrations exceeding the regulatory limit set (2 ppm) must be \ndisposed of properly.\nDisposal of PCBs has been so far addressed through \nvarious approaches. The most conventional approach is high \ntemperature controlled incineration.10,11 The incineration \ntechnology is quite effective for destruction of PCBs. How­\never, it is hampered by the disposal costs and the exclusion \nof reusable materials, as well as by highly toxic by-products \nsuch as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and \npolychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Another approaches \ninvolve pyrolysis, chemical methods (adsorption, catalytic \nhydrodechlorination, ozonation, ultrasonic, photolytic, wet \nair oxidation, reaction with a sodium salt in amine solvent, \nand etc.),12-15 supercritical water oxidation (SWO),16 and \nmicrobial degradation.17,18 Among these methods, catalytic \nhydrodechlorination has been recognized as a promising \ntechnology due to its easy and simple procedures.19-21 How­\never, most of the catalytic hydrodechlorination processes \nhave been carried out in various organic solvents. Such pro­\ncess consumes plenty of organic solvents that are volatile \n\nDestruction and Removal of PCBs in Waste Transformer Oil Bull. Korean Chem. Soc. 2007, Vol. 28, No. 4 521\nand toxic. Moreover, the removal efficiency of PCBs is still \nfar from satisfaction.\nThe present study is concerned about a comprehensive \nevaluation of an alternative chemical dechlorination process. \nChlorines from PCBs are removed, as shown in below, by \npoly(ethylene) glycol acting as a nucleophile in reaction \nwith PCBs under the basic condition. This process has \nproven to be practical and highly cost-effective for disposal \nof PCBs directly in transformer oil and the recovery of the \ntreated oil. Furthermore, the process avoids the use of \npotentially dangerous alkali metals and alkali metal oxides \nbeing generally employed as catalysts.\nExperiment지 Section\nMateri지s and methods. A sample of waste transformer \noil was obtained from a power plant in Korea. An aliquot of \noil was withdrawn and analyzed for PCBs according to the \nprocedures described in Figure 1. It was observed that any \nPCBs were not present in transformer oil above 5 ppb of \ndetection limit. For this reason, chemical dechlorination pro­\ncess was accomplished with fresh transformer oil artificially \nloaded with commercial PCB mixtures of Aroclor 1242, \n1254, and 1260 (Accustandard, Inc., USA). Transformer oil \nwas contaminated with 100 ppm of PCB mixtures. Chemical\nFigure 1.

Ltd., Korea, were \nprepared for decontamination of PCB-laden transformer oil. \nPEG was used to remove chlorines from PCBs in oil under \nKOH \nas a\nbasic condition. The soild \nbefore use. Al was utilized\nwas ground to a powder \ndechlorination accelerator.\nThe chemical dechlorination process reported here is as \nfollows:\nDuring the process, the mole ratios of PEG 600 and \nchlorine content of PCBs in oil were varied from 11.42:1 to \n57.1:1. The concentrations of KOH and Al were 3.0% and \n2.0% (w/w basis) relative to oil, respectively. Figure 2 pre­\nsents a batch-type reactor, which was made of a double \njacketed glass, for disposal of PCBs. A magnetic stirrer with \ntwo bladed impellers was installed to provide efficient \nmixing of the chemical reagents and oil. Nitrogen was used \nto prevent oxidative degradation of the transformer oil. The \nreaction mixture was heated to the desired reaction temper­\natures by adjusting the temperature of the hot oil in the outer \njacket. As the reaction runs, reaction mixture gradually \nturned to a darkening color and sludge. Aliquots of the \nreactor content were removed periodically and submitted for \nPCB analysis.\nAnalysis. A gas chromatograph (Trace GC 2000, Italy) \nequipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and a 30 \nm x 0.25 mm, 0.25 ^m 5% phenylpolysiloxane Zebron ZB- \n5 column (Torrance, CA) was used for separation and quan­\ntification of PCBs. The GC oven program was the follow­\ning: initial temperature 170 oC, retained for 2 min, then\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of a batch-type reactor for PCB \ndestruction process.\n\n522 Bull.

The injection was performed in a split­\nless mode. A 10% CH4 in Ar was used as the carrier gas. \nChromatographic peaks were identified by relative retention \ntime, with pentachlorobenzene (PCBz) as a retention time \nmarker.\nResults and Discussion\nIdentification of PCB congeners in PCB mixtures. A \nGC chromatogram of commercial PCB mixtures (Aroclor \n1242, 1254, and 1260) added into transformer oil was \nobtained with a ZB-5 column and an ECD, as shown in \nFigure 3. Previous to instrumental analysis of PCBs, sample \ntreatment of transformer oil containing PCBs was extremely \ntedious and time-consuming because the oil was unclean, \ntherefore the cleaning steps such as florisil and silica gel \nwere required. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of each \nPCB congener was also significantly complicated due to the \nlarge number of PCB congeners and/or isomers present in \ncommercial PCB mixtures.\nIn total, 74 chromatographic peaks were identified, each \nof which contained either a well-resolved peak or a cluster of \nunresolved peaks. A total of 123 PCB congeners including \nthe presence of co-eluted congeners were found in PCB \nmixtures on the basis of the relative retention times and \nlisted on the chromatographic peak to which they belong. \nOut of these congeners, any congeners gave hardly any \ndetectable signal. The numbers listed here were in accor­\ndance with IUPAC rules.22 The individual PCB mixtures are \ndifferent in substitution patterns and the degree of chlori-\n25.00 \nnation. For instance, Aroclor 1242 comprises almost entirely \ncongeners with between 2 and 5 chlorine atoms on the two \nrings of biphenyl, whereas the PCB congeners consisting \nAroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260 have 4-7 and 5-9 chlorine \natoms, respectively. In addition, the retention times of each \nPCB mixture by GC/ECD were typically detected in order of \nAroclor 1242, Aroclor 1254, and Aroclor 1260.\nDisposal of PCBs by chemical dechlorination process \nat different reaction conditions. In this work, the effect of \nreaction temperature assisted chemical dechlorination process \nwas studied for removal of PCBs in transformer oil. There­\nfore, amounts of reactants, reaction time, and rate of mixing \nwere all kept constant during the run. During the reaction of \nPEG/KOH with PCBs, PEG serves as a nucleophile under \nbasic condition which attack a partially positive charged \ncarbon on benzene, resulting in leaving a chlorine. Aluminum \nplays a role in accelerating dechlorination. The chemical \nreaction process was somewhat slow due to the high viscosity \nof transformer oil, despite vigorous mechanical stirring for \nthe indicated time. The reaction mixture gradually appeared \nto be a homogeneous and black sludge during the process \nruns.\nFigure 4 shows the residual PCBs in transformer oil after \nreaction of PCBs with chemical reactants as stated earlier for \n120 min at different temperatures. Compared with Figure 3 \nrepresenting the PCB concentration level of 100 ppm, it was \nobserved that, when increasing the temperature from 25 oC \n(Fig. 4A) via 50 oC (Fig. 4B), to 100 oC (Fig. 4C), the numbers \nand height of PCB peaks have a tendency to gradually \ndiminish. The results clearly demonstrated that removal of \nPCBs in transformer oil by chemical reaction was highly \ndependant on the reaction temperature.\n19.80\nFigure 3.

GC/ECD chromatogram of PCB congeners remained in \ntransformer oil after chemical treatment with PEG 600, KOH, and \nAl for 2 hours at different temperatures.\nThe performance of this study was assessed in terms of the \ndestruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of PCBs. DRE \nvalue was expressed as percentage. Average DREs of PCBs \nwere determined by comparison of relative peak area corre­\nsponding to the starting PCB mixtures. The numbers and \nheight of PCB congeners in Figure 4B achieved from experi­\nmental condition at 50 oC were nearly identical to those of \nFigure 4A at 25 oC, except for disappearing only PCB no. \n195 and 208. At 50 oC, % average DRE of PCB congeners, \nas listed in Table 1, was 29.67%, while % average DRE at 25 \noC was 28.91%. The experimental results show that reaction \ntemperature of 50 oC is not still enough to remove PCBs \ndirectly in transformer oil.\nHowever, when increasing the reaction temperature to 100 \noC, the PCB compositions of Figure 4C obtained were no \nlonger similar to those of Figure 4A and 4B, and Figure 3 as \na starting composition of PCB mixtures. The % average \nDRE achieved at 100 oC reached 77.94%, showing complete \nremoval of PCB congeners containing mostly 7-9 chlorines \non two rings of biphenyl which appear later than PCB no. \n183. The trend suggests that Aroclor 1260 could be more \nrapidly removed, along with significantly reducing the \nconcentration of PCBs, than Aroclor 1242 in a PEG/KOH/\nFigure 5.

Such patterns obviously confirmed that the \nchemical reaction of PCBs and PEG under basic condition \ntakes place essentially through the successive elimination of \nhigher chlorinated PCBs preferentially.\nCertain non- and mono-ortho PCB congeners, which \npossess coplanar geometry, are responsible for their high \ntoxicity.23 Throughout the commercial PCB mixtures, the \ntoxic PCB congeners such as PCB no. 77 (3,3',4,4'-tetraCB), \n105 (2,3,3',4,4'-pentaCB), 118 (2,3',4,4',5-pentaCB), 123 \n(2',3,4,4',5-pentaCB) and 169 (3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexaCB) were \nidentified. The DRE of each toxic PCB congener was \nincreased with increasing the reaction temperature. How­\never, when compared Figure 4A, 4B, and 4C each other, it \nwas interesting that the peak height of PCB no 169 became \ntaller at temperature condition of 50 oC and then completely \ndisappeared at 100 oC.\nThe performance of PEG/PCB system in basic medium \nwas also evaluated with different reaction time. The follow­\ning parameters such as the rate of mixing, reaction temper­\nature, and amounts of reagents therefore remained constant\n\n524 Bull. Korean Chem.

(90, 101), PCB (65, 95), (PCB 41, 84), and \netc. consisting of Aroclor 1242, were found in treated trans­\nformer oil, together with a significant decrease in peak height \nof PCBs and the average DRE obtained was 99.46%, as \nlisted in Table 2. At 150 oC and 60 min, the numbers and \npeak height of residual PCBs in transformer oil were more \ndecreased than those of the conditions above-mentioned. \nThe average DRE reached 99.73%, and it showed that some \nPCB congeners such as PCB no. (90, 101), (41, 64), (49), \n(22, 51), and (20, 33, 53) disappeared preferentially.\nIn order to improve the destruction and removal efficiency \nof PCBs, the reaction time was further extended. As a result, \na little higher % DRE (99.93%) was achieved at conditions \nof 120 min and 150 oC compared to that in the case of 60 \nmin and 150 oC. All the remaining PCB peaks in treated \ntransformer oil were the following: PCB no. (5, 8), (15, 17, \n18), and (28, 31). The best results were attained under \nconditions of 240 min and 150 oC, where only a peak (PCB \nno. 5, 8) was found in treated transformer oil as a result of \nconsecutively dechlorinating reaction. Average DRE of PCBs, \nas shown in Table 2, was 99.99% or better. It was observed \nthat complete destruction of PCBs in transformer oil could \nbe achieved by conducting the reaction for a longer period of \ntime at higher temperature.\nIn this report, we have completed a laboratory evaluation \nof the chemical reaction of PCBs with PEG and KOH in \ntransformer oil. Several key points were made: (1) The reac­\ntion was carried out in transformer oil directly. In the case of \nPCB-laden transformer oil, from the practical view-point, \ndechlolinating PCBs directly in oil is a suitable disposal \nmethod. To the best of our knowledge, most of the dechlori­\nnating processes for transformer oil containing PCBs have \nimplemented in various organic solvents. Recently, nano­\nmetric sodium hydride (nano-NaH) and transition metal \ncatalysts have been directly used to dechlorinate PCBs in \ntransformer oil19; (2) The chemical reagents PEG and KOH \nused in this study are common and fairly inexpensive. Hence, \nthe cost of oil decontamination might be below any available \nalternative disposal costs; (3) Certain PCB congeners, PCB \nno. 77, 105, 118, 123 and 169, are approximate isostereomers \nof the most toxic 2,3,7,8-TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated \ndibenzo-p-dioxin) in their coplanar conformation. It is \napparent that such toxic PCB congeners are easily removed \nby PEG under basic condition; (4) The operation of reactor \nsystem is simple and safe, requiring no special precautions.\nRecovery of the treated transformer oil. After comple­\ntion of the experiments, the reactor content was drained into \na vessel and cooled to room temperature. The treated trans­\nformer oil was segregated from the contents by filtering, \nwashing with water, dehydrating under vacuum, and centri­\nfuging; this resulted in precipitation of PEG, KOH, Al, and \nreaction products. Such segregating steps described above con­\nstitute standard treatment of treated transformer oil before reuse.\nKeon Sang Ryoo et al.\nConclusion\nWe have developed a safe, inexpensive, and efficient \nchemical dechlorinating process for the disposal of PCBs \ndirectly in transformer oil. The numbers and peak height of \nresidual PCBs in treated oil were gradually decreased in \norder of Aroclor 1260, 1254, and 1242 with increasing the \nreaction temperature and time, which is the characteristic of \nconsecutive reaction. In PCBs/PEG/KOH system under \nexperimental conditions of 150 oC and 4 hr, the destruction \nand removal efficiency of PCBs including certain PCBs \n(PCB no. 77, 118, 105, 123 and 169), which are responsible \nfor their toxicity, was equivalent to or better than 99.99%. \nFurthermore, another interesting feature of the process is \nthat it permits high recovery of the treated oil through simple \nsegregating procedures.\nAcknowledgment.
