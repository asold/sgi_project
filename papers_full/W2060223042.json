    "abstract": "The continuous supply of electric power to customers is in close relation to the reliable operation of the distribution transformer. Generally speaking, the life of a transformer is equal to the life of the insulation system, which in turn depends on its mechanical strength and its electrical integrity [1]. The oilpaper insulation system of a transformer is subjected to several types of stress, such as electrical, thermal, environmental, and mechanical stress. The actions of each of the above stress factors or the synergy effects cause the aging of the insulating system. Thus, these stress factors are called aging factors [2]. © 2006 IEEE.",
