Nashwan, \nanashwan@hamad.qa\nAbstract\nThe rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and the emergence of large language models (LLMs), like\nGPT-4, create a unique opportunity to transform nursing care planning. In this editorial, we explore the\npotential applications of AI in the nursing process, with a focus on patient data assessment and\ninterpretation, communication with patients and families, identifying gaps in care plans, and ongoing\nprofessional development. We also examine the ethical concerns and challenges associated with AI\nintegration in healthcare, such as data privacy and security, fairness and bias, accountability and\nresponsibility, and the delicate balance between human-AI collaboration. To implement LLMs responsibly\nand effectively in nursing care planning, we recommend prioritizing robust data security measures,\ntransparent and unbiased algorithms, clear accountability guidelines, and human-AI collaboration. By\naddressing these issues, we can improve nursing care planning and ensure the best possible care for\npatients.\nCategories:\n Public Health, Other, Epidemiology/Public Health\nKeywords:\n human-ai collaboration, ethical considerations, nursing care planning, large language models, artificial\nintelligence\nEditorial\nNursing care planning has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century when pioneers like\nFlorence Nightingale emphasized the importance of personalized care and patient-centered practices \n[1]\n.\nHowever, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that nursing care planning gained prominence, as nurses\nrecognized the need for evidence-based and systematic approaches to patient care \n[2]\n. Nursing care planning\nremains an integral part of the nursing process, involving assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation,\nand evaluation \n[3]\n. With the help of advanced healthcare informatics and technology, nurses can now\nefficiently access, analyze, and utilize patient data like never before. This improved capability results in\nbetter patient outcomes and promotes a more dynamic and responsive approach to nursing practice.\nUtilizing these state-of-the-art tools and resources allows nursing professionals to navigate the complex\nand ever-changing healthcare landscape better, ultimately enhancing patient care's overall quality and\neffectiveness.\nThe healthcare industry has the potential to undergo a significant transformation with the integration of\nartificial intelligence (AI) in nursing care planning. Nursing professionals can utilize large language models\n(LLMs) like GPT-4 to interpret patient data, improve decision-making, and facilitate communication.\nHowever, the implementation of AI in nursing care planning raises ethical concerns and challenges that\nmust be addressed. In this editorial, we aim to briefly highlight the possible uses of LLMs in nursing care\nplanning. We also delve into the ethical concerns that come with their implementation and provide\nrecommendations on how to integrate them responsibly and effectively into nursing practice. Our ultimate\nobjective is to harness the potential of AI while preserving the crucial human element in patient care.\nNursing professionals can benefit greatly from AI applications \n[4]\n, and LLMs are not an exception. These\nmodels can speed up the assessment and interpretation of patient data, allowing for quick and accurate\nprocessing of critical information, such as medical history, diagnostic results, and ongoing observations \n[5]\n.\nThis information informs the development of care plans and ultimately improves patient outcomes \n[5]\n.\nAdditionally, LLMs can generate clear and easy-to-understand explanations of complex medical concepts,\npromoting effective communication between healthcare providers, patients, and their families. LLMs also\nassist nursing professionals in identifying gaps or deviations from established best practices, ensuring that\ncare plans are continuously refined and evidence-based. Lastly, LLMs can provide personalized learning\nmaterials that cater to individual nurses' needs and preferences, fostering ongoing professional growth and\nexpertise in the field. Figure \n1\n illustrates a synthesized representation of a hypothetical case where GPT-4\nplayed an instrumental role in assisting the formulation of a comprehensive nursing care plan for Mr. John\nAnderson, a 65-year-old patient with Congestive Heart Failure. The figure concisely depicts the collaborative\ninteraction between the healthcare professional, Nurse Caroline, and the AI tool, as well as the systematic\nsteps taken in data analysis, diagnosis formulation, goal setting, intervention implementation,\n1\n1\n \n Open Access\nEditorial\n \nDOI:\n 10.7759/cureus.40542\nHow to cite this article\nNashwan A J, Abujaber A A (June 16, 2023) Harnessing Large Language Models in Nursing Care Planning: Opportunities, Challenges, and Ethical\nConsiderations.

One of the primary concerns is data privacy and security since AI relies\non vast amounts of sensitive patient information. Therefore, robust security measures and data\nconfidentiality are crucial. It is also essential to develop transparent and unbiased algorithms to ensure that\nAI does not perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases in healthcare. This is important as it may lead to\nunequal treatment or outcomes for certain patient populations. The integration of AI in healthcare decision-\nmaking raises questions about accountability and responsibility, necessitating clear guidelines and\nregulations to address potential errors or adverse outcomes. Lastly, it is crucial to strike a balance between\nleveraging AI's capabilities and maintaining the essential human touch in patient care. AI should serve as a\ntool to augment, rather than replace, human expertise and compassion in nursing.\nIn order to use LLMs for nursing care planning in an ethical and responsible manner, several\nrecommendations have been put forward. Firstly, it is important to implement robust data privacy and\nsecurity measures to protect sensitive patient information by adhering to relevant regulations and industry\nbest practices. Secondly, developing unbiased AI algorithms that incorporate diverse data sets and\nperspectives during development and testing is crucial to ensure fairness and accuracy. Thirdly, clear\nguidelines and regulations on accountability and responsibility in AI-driven healthcare decision-making\nshould be established to maintain professional standards and address potential errors or adverse outcomes.\nFinally, human-AI collaboration should be prioritized by emphasizing the importance of the human touch in\npatient care and fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation among nursing professionals to\nensure the successful integration of AI in nursing practice.\nIncorporating LLMs into nursing care planning offers promising potential for enhancing the nursing process\nand improving patient outcomes. However, it is crucial to thoughtfully address the ethical concerns and\nchallenges that come with AI implementation. This editorial provides an overview of the application of AI in\nnursing care planning, finding the right balance between cutting-edge technology and the indispensable\nhuman element in patient care.\nAdditional Information\nDisclosures\nConflicts of interest:\n In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the\nfollowing: \nPayment/services info:\n All authors have declared that no financial support was received from\nany organization for the submitted work. \nFinancial relationships:\n All authors have declared that they have\nno financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might\nhave an interest in the submitted work. \nOther relationships:\n All authors have declared that there are no\nother relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\nReferences\n2023 Nashwan et al.
