  "abstract": "Abstract In view of the limitations of current deep learning models in segmenting dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images, specifically dealing with complex root morphological features, fuzzy boundaries between tooth roots and alveolar bone, and the need for costly annotation of dental CBCT images. We collected dental CBCT data from 200 patients and annotated 45 of them for network training, and proposed a CNN-Transformer Architecture UNet network, which combines the advantages of CNN and Transformer. The CNN component effectively extracts local features, while the Transformer captures long-range dependencies. Multiple spatial attention modules were included to enhance the network’s ability to extract and represent spatial information. Additionally, we introduced a novel Masked image modeling method to pre-train the CNN and Transformer modules simultaneously, mitigating limitations due to a smaller amount of labeled training data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved superior performance (DSC of 87.12%, IoU of 78.90%, HD95 of 0.525 mm, ASSD of 0.199 mm), and provides a more efficient and effective approach to automatically and accurately segment dental CBCT images, has real-world applicability in orthodontics and dental implants.",
