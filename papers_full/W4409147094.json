  "abstract": "Background: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance information processing and clinical reasoning in the healthcare industry but are hindered by inaccuracies and hallucinations. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique may address these problems by integrating external knowledge sources. Methods: We developed a RAG-based chatbot called Thyro-GenAI by integrating a database of textbooks and guidelines with LLM. Thyro-GenAI and three service LLMs: OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o, Perplexity AI’s ChatGPT-4o, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, were asked personalized clinical questions about thyroid disease. Three thyroid specialists assessed the quality of the generated responses and references without being blinded, which allowed them to interact with different chatbot interfaces. Results: Thyro-GenAI achieved the highest inverse-weighted mean rank for overall response quality. The overall inverse-weighted mean rankings for Thyro-GenAI, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude were 3.0, 2.3, 2.8, and 1.9, respectively. Thyro-GenAI also achieved the second-highest inverse-weighted mean rank for overall reference quality. The overall inverse-weighted mean rankings for Thyro-GenAI, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude were 3.1, 2.3, 3.2, and 1.8, respectively. Conclusions: Thyro-GenAI produced patient-specific clinical reasoning output based on a vector database, with fewer hallucinations and more reliability, compared to service LLMs. This emphasis on evidence-based responses ensures its safety and validity, addressing a critical limitation of existing LLMs. By integrating RAG with LLMs, it has the potential to support frontline clinical decision-making, especially helping first-line physicians by offering reliable decision support while managing thyroid disease patients.",
