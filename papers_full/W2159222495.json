A classic case in point is the persistent\ndifficulty that native speakers of Japanese face in distin-\nguishing the English liquids [r] and [l].\nIt is clear that Japanese natives exposed to English in\nadulthoodhave great difficultyidentifyingor discriminat-\ning stimuli forming minimalpairs that contrast[r] versus[l],\nsuch as road and load (Miyawaki et al., 1975), even after\nyears of exposure to English. There is, however, a growing\nbody of evidencethat some abilityto learn nonnativecon-\ntrasts remains into adulthood. Several groups have shown\nthat trainingcan lead to improvementin identification and\ndiscrimination of nonnative contrasts (Jamieson & Mo-\nrosan, 1986, 1989; Morosan & Jamieson, 1989; Pisoni,\nAslin, Perey, & Hennessy, 1982; Pruitt, 1995; Tees &\nWerker, 1984), including [r] versus [l] (Logan, Lively, &\nPisoni, 1991; Strange & Dittmann, 1984). Althoughthe ef-\nfects have often been short-livedand/or specific to the train-\ning stimuliused, there are some data that show broader and/\nor longer lasting improvementsin adults (Lively, Logan, &\nPisoni, 1993; Lively, Pisoni,Y amada, Tohkura, & Y amada,\n1994). Also, identification and production of [r] and [l] is\nbetter in Japanese who have lived in an English-speaking\nsociety for 20 years, as compared with Japanesewith only\n1 or 2 years of such experience (Flege, Takagi, & Mann,\n1996), although even Japanese with extensive exposure to\n89 Copyright 2002 Psychonomic Society , Inc.\nThe work reported in this article was supported by grants from the\nNational Science Foundation (LIS-9720348), the National Institute of\nMental Health (MH47566), and the J.

MCCLELLAND\nCenter for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nand Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nA Hebbian model of learning predicts that adults may be able to acquire a nonnative speech contrast\nif they are trained with stimuli that are exaggerated to make them perceptually distinct. To test these\nideas, we asked Japanese adults to identify contrasting [r]–[l] stimuli (e.g., rock–lock) in two training\nconditions. In the adaptive condition, the [r]–[l] contrast was exaggeratedat first and then adjusted to\nmaintain accurate identification. In the fixed condition, a fixed pair of stimuli were used that were dis-\ntinguishable by native English speakers but difficult for the Japanese learners to discriminate. To ex-\namine whether feedback contributes to learning, we ran separate groups with and without feedback in\nthe fixed and the adaptive conditions. Without feedback, 3 days of adaptive training produced sub-\nstantial improvements, but 3 days of fixed training produced no benefit relative to control, consistent\nwith the Hebbian account. With feedback, both fixed and adaptive training led to robust improvements,\nand the benefit of training transferred to a second continuum (e.g., road–load). The results are con-\nsistent with Hebbian models that are augmented to be sensitive to feedback.\n90 M CCANDLISS, FIEZ, PROTOPAPAS, CONWAY , AND MCCLELLAND\nEnglish performed more poorly than native English\nspeakers. Other studies have shown that extensive labora-\ntory training can lead to substantial, generalizable im-\nprovement. In one study (Bradlow, Pisoni, Y amada, &\nTohkura, 1997), 45 h of training on a range of different\nminimal pair stimuli from five different speakers resulted\nin an average increase of 19% in the accuracy of forced-\nchoice identification of the correct [r] or [l] member of\neach minimal pair. Generalization was nearly as good as\nposttraining performance on the training materials, and\nthe benefits of training persisted for at least 6 months, af-\nfecting production as well as identificationof words con-\ntaining [r] and [l] (Bradlow , Akahane-Y amada, Pisoni, &\nTohkura, 1999). Overall, existing data certainly suggest\nthat the mechanisms of language perception are not com-\npletely fixed in adulthood;clearly, though, they seem rel-\natively inflexible, on the basis of comparisons of adult\nlanguage learners with younger learners or with adults\nlearning other skills. Understanding why speech percep-\ntion can be so resistant to change in adulthood may help\nus find ways to help second-language learners overcome\nthis resistance and may lead to new insights into the na-\nture of the mechanisms of learning and natural language\nacquisition.\nOur work explores the idea that one factor in these per-\nsistent learning difficulties may be a paradoxical charac-\nteristic of a domain-general learning mechanism, which\nmay work to maintain preestablished perceptualrepresen-\ntations in the face of exposure to new experiences.Specif-\nically, we will consider the hypothesisthat Hebbian synap-\ntic plasticity may tend to reinforce perceptual categories\nthat have been establishedearly in life, contributingto the\ndifficulty of new learning in adulthood.This Hebbian ap-\nproach leads to predictions concerning what kinds of re-\ntraining regimes might be used to produce effective reme-\ndiation, predictions that will be tested in the reported\nexperiments.\nA premise of the Hebbian account is the observationthat\nlanguageexperience has an influence on how we perceive\nacoustic information,affecting which stimuli we perceive\nas similar and which as different. For example, adult na-\ntive English speakers clearly distinguish [r] and [l], but\nnative Japanese speakers lose the ability to perceive this\ndistinction(Miyawaki et al., 1975). These effects begin to\noccur very early in life (Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens,\n& Lindblom, 1992; Werker & Tees, 1983, 1984). A range\nof mechanisms and metaphors have been introduced to\ncapture the role of experience in shaping the perception\nof speech, and several of these ideas have been used to ad-\ndress the difficulties second-language learners face in\nlearning nonnativelanguagecontrasts. One influentialac-\ncount suggests that experience with instances of a speech\nsound category are represented in the form of an abstract\ncognitive prototype and, furthermore, that this perceptual\nprototype acts as a perceptual magnet , influencing per-\nception of similar stimuli (Kuhl, 1991). Others have pro-\nposed that collections of representations of specific spo-\nken experiences, rather than abstract prototypes, could\nserve as the basis for a magnet-likeeffect (Lacerda, 1995).\nAnother account (Guenther & Gjaja, 1996)draws on con-\ncepts from neuroscience studies of perceptual systems to\nsuggest that language experiences directly influence or-\nganization of a topographic map for acoustic perception\nand shows how such experience-basedchanges in the per-\nceptual map can influence how nonnative speech stimuli\nare perceived.\nThe structure of the native phonologicalspace has been\ndemonstrated to greatly affect perception of nonnative\nspeech sounds,so that some of these soundsare perceived\nas (good or poor) exemplars of a native speech sound cat-\negory, whereas others are perceived as not belonging to\nany nativespeech category or even to the domain of speech.\nIn the perceptualassimilationmodel (P AM) developedby\nBest and colleagues(Best, 1995; Best, McRoberts, & Sit-\nhole,1988),nonnativesoundsthat are similar to soundsin\nthe learner’ s native language are assimilated to represen-\ntations of the characteristic articulatory programs used to\nproduce the related sounds from the learner’ s native lan-\nguage. The focus of the P AM is on predicting the diffi-\nculty of discriminating specific nonnative phonetic con-\ntrasts, and the model’ s predictions have been generally\nquite successful (Best, 1995; cf. Guion, Flege, Akahane-\nY amada, & Pruitt, 2000).\nBeyondstaticnonnativephoneticperceptionand contrast\ndiscrimination ability , the extent oflearning to discrimi-\nnate nonnative phonetic contrasts is a principal focus of\nthe speech-learningmodel (SLM; Flege, 1995). The SLM\npostulates that “the mechanisms and processes used in\nlearning the [native language]sound system . . . remain in-\ntact overthe life span” (Flege, 1995,p. 239) and that these\nmechanisms are continually at work in second-language\nlearning. On the basis of these principles,the SLM strives\nto predict long-term phonetic development for specific\nnonnativephoneticcontrasts. Several SLM hypothesesre-\nlate to a person’ s age of initial important use of the non-\nnative language and to the extent of reliance on the non-\nnativelanguageversuscontinueduse of the nativelanguage.\nPerceptual similarity between native and nonnative pho-\nnetic categories also plays an important role in the SLM.\nExperience with nonnative speech sounds can gradually\nlead to the formation of new phonetic categories accord-\ning to this model, but the rate at which this occurs will be\na functionof how stronglythe soundsin the new language\nare assimilated into the established phonetic category\nstructure. The strength of the assimilation is greater if the\nnative sounds are more strongly entrenched before expo-\nsure to the new language and is also greater when the\nsounds of the nonnative language are close in perceptual\nspace to existing sounds of the native language. In the\nSLM, experience still shapes the phonetic category land-\nscape at all ages, but greater entrenchment carries with it\ngreaterresistanceto change.At the extreme, category for-\nmation for a nonnative language sound may be blocked by\nthe mechanism of “equivalenceclassification”—that is, if\nTEACHING JAPANESE ADULTS THE [r]–[l] CONTRAST 91\nboth members of a nonnative contrastive pair are percep-\ntually equivalent with respect to the native phonetic cate-\ngories, new categories may never form.\nThe PAM and the SLM provide explanations for the\ngreat differences in the ease with which nonnative con-\ntrast pairs can be initially discriminated and ultimately\nlearned, depending on one’ s native language. However,\ngiven a particular nonnativephoneticcontrast, with its as-\nsociated perceptual difficulty and learnability, neither\nmodel proposes an actual mechanism through which ex-\nperience with nonnative sounds leads to change. Our own\nideas addressthis issue, buildingon the startingplace pro-\nvidedby these importantmodels. We take the explicitstep\nof suggesting (with Guenther & Gjaja, 1996) that the\nneural substrate of a phonetic percept may be a pattern of\nneural activity within some region or regions of the cere-\nbral cortex. Given this, we suggest that experience with a\nlanguagemay result in a situation in which a recurring cat-\negorical pattern of neural activity is elicited by a range of\nacousticallydistinctinputs—in some cases, failing to cap-\nture aspects of speech input that distinguish nonnative\nphonemes.\nWe are now in a position to see how Hebbian learning,\nwhen applied to the learning of perceptual categories in\nspeech,mightprovide a framework within which the mech-\nanisms that reinforce the tendencyto hear a range of stim-\nuli as being the same might impede the abilityto learn new\nperceptual distinctions in adulthood. The basic idea fol-\nlows quite directly from the essential assumption under-\nlying Hebb’ s proposal, which we paraphrase from Hebb\n(1949) as follows:When one neuron,A, participatesin fir-\ning another neuron, B, the strength of the effect of A on\nthe firing of B is increased . Such a learning rule should\ntend to strengthen whatever response a neural system\nmakes to an incoming stimulus. Applying this idea to\nspeech perception, when a pattern of neural activity at a\nperipheral level elicits a cortical pattern corresponding to\na percept, the strength of the connections from the pe-\nripheral neurons to the neurons constituting the percept,\nand among the neurons constituting the percept, is in-\ncreased. Thus, if it is true that, when a Japanese listener\nhears either an [r] or an [l], one and the same perceptual\nrepresentationis activated,Hebbian learning should work\nto maintain this tendency . Computersimulationsof a model\nillustratinghow this may occur have been presented (Mc-\nClelland, Thomas, McCandliss, & Fiez, 1999). Here, we\nconsider the consequences of these ideas for retraining\nlanguage perception.\nIf the Hebbian account is correct, it should be possible\nfor Japanese adults to learn the [r]–[l] distinction,if only\nwe can find contrasting [r]- and [l]-like stimuli that will\nelicit distinctperceptualrepresentations.In this case, Heb-\nbian learning would reinforce the tendencyof these inputs\nto elicit such distinct representations, potentially leading\nto rapid progress in perceptual learning. One way to do\nthis is to create [r] and [l] stimuli based on natural speech,\nin which the portion of the speech signalcorrespondingto\nthe [r] and the [l] phonemes and adjacent transitions has\nbeen acousticallyaltered to exaggerate the differences be-\ntween them. By using highly exaggerated stimuli that\nmost of our Japanese native subjects do hear as different,\nwe expect Hebbian learning to reinforce the resulting dis-\ntinct percepts. Assuming that the tendency to hear the ex-\naggerated stimuli as distinctgeneralizes to other, very sim-\nilar stimuli, it should then be possible to gradually reduce\nthe degree of exaggeration, establishing distinct percepts\nfor stimuli that are more and more similar until the ability\nto distinguishthem extendsintothe naturalrange. The Heb-\nbian account also leads us to predict that if we were to at-\ntempt to train Japanese adults with stimuli that they could\nnot initially discriminate,Hebbian learning would tend to\nmaintain the tendency to perceive the stimuli as similar,\nand no learning should occur. Predictions similar to the\nones just outlined can be derived from many of the other\nmodels discussed above,on the basis of the idea that stim-\nuli that are stronglyassimilated to existing perceptual rep-\nresentations will be difficult to distinguish and this diffi-\nculty will impede acquisition.\nA further predictionarises from the fact that perceptual\nlearning under our Hebbian account does not depend on\nfeedback about the accuracy of one’ s perceptions.Indeed,\nan appealing aspect of a Hebbian account is that it pro-\nvides a basis for understanding how language representa-\ntions may be affected by experience very early in life, when\nthere may be no explicit task or intent to learn (Saffran,\nAslin, & Newport, 1996) but the child is simply hearing\nambient speech in its environment. This form of learning\nmay play a role during the perinatal period, during which\nthe child is establishing perceptual representations con-\nsistent with the native languageenvironment(Kuhl, 1993;\nKuhl & Iverson, 1995). In any case, the Hebbian account\npredicts that the use of stimuli that exaggerate the contrast\nbetween [r] and [l] will allow nonnativespeakers to learn\nto discriminate these stimuli, even in the absence of any\nfeedback. This prediction appears to be contrary to a tacit\nassumptionof previous researchers who have investigated\nthe ability to learn novel speech categories, even though\nthe matter has not been systematicallyinvestigated(Logan\n& Pruitt, 1995). To our knowledge,all previous studies of\nlearning nonnative contrasts have provided subjects with\nfeedback during at least some part of the training proce-\ndure. Thus, it is of considerable interest to determine what\ncan be learned in the absence of feedback. For this reason,\na crucial aspect of the design of our experiment is that we\nexamined conditions in which subjects received no feed-\nback during training. Again, we note that this prediction\nmay also be consistent with other approaches. We would\nnote, however, that our explicit consideration of the ap-\nplicabilityof the Hebbian learning rule brings the issue of\nlearning without feedback into focus.\nTo address these issues, we used two contrasting train-\ning conditionswith two groups of Japanese adult subjects\nwhose initial ability to discriminate minimal pairs begin-\nning with [r] or [l] was very poor, relativeto English speak-\n92 M CCANDLISS, FIEZ, PROTOPAPAS, CONWAY , AND MCCLELLAND\ners. In these conditions,the two groupsof subjectsreceived\nno feedback on the accuracy of their responses. We exam-\nined whether the subjects in each conditioncould learn to\nrespond differentially to the members of these pairs. The\ntwo contrasted conditionsare called the adaptive and the\nfixed training conditions. In the adaptive condition, sub-\njects were trained with initially exaggerated stimuli (see\nFigure 1) that were equidistant from the point at which\nperception of our native speaker group crossed over from\n[l] to [r]. Then, the stimuli were adjusted throughout the\ncourse of learning, in an effort to ensure that the subject\nreceived perceptually distinguishablestimuli throughout.\nOn each training trial, the subject responded with a key-\npress to identify the first phoneme of the word as an [r] or\nan [l]. Success on eight stimuli in a row resulted in re-\nplacement of one of the training stimuli with a slightlyless\nexaggerated stimulus, moving one small step inward\nalong the [r]–[l] continuum. A single incorrect response\nresulted in replacing one of the stimuli with the item one\nstep further from the crossover point. Adjustments were\nbalancedto keep the stimulias nearly equidistantfrom the\ncrossover point as possible, stopping at the endpoints in-\ndicated in the figure. In the fixed condition, a second\ngroup of subjects received the same number of training\ntrials and had the same task of attempting to identify the\nstimuli. However, the stimuli were a fixed pair of contrast-\ning speech tokens (also indicated in Figure 1) that were re-\nliably identified by English speakers but that the Japanese\nsubjects could not discriminate with an accuracy greater\nthan 70%.\nOur adaptive training procedure is similar to the proce-\ndure used by Jamieson and Morosan (1986) and Morosan\nand Jamieson (1989) to train adult francophones on the\nEnglish [\nD]–[u] contrast, although these investigators\nused feedback throughout training and provided no con-\ntrast to any other training condition. Other investigators\n(Merzenich et al., 1996; Tallal et al., 1996) have used ex-\naggerated stimuli and adaptive training in their protocol\nfor remediating language-processing deficits in children\nwith specific language impairment, and the reported suc-\ncess of their interventionprovided part of the initial moti-\nvation of our own efforts. They found a greater benefitfor\ntheir experimental group over a control group that re-\nceivedtrainingwith nonexaggeratedstimuli.Like Jamieson\nand Morosan, they used feedback in many of their train-\ning conditions.Also, it should be noted that their interven-\ntions were rather broad-ranging, in that they involved\ntraining on discrimination of rapid auditory transitions,\ntraining on discrimination of a wide range of speech con-\ntrasts, and extensive training on tasks requiring compre-\nFigure 1.

Large empty\ncircles represent the anchor stimuli resynthesized from the recorded base stimuli (see the Method section).\nData points between the anchor stimuli are responses to stimuli interpolated between these anchors, and\ndata points in the peripheral regions represent responses to extrapolated speech stimuli. Stimuli used for\nthe fixed training condition are indicated with large filled circles. Triangles point to the positions of the ini-\ntial stimuli used in the adaptive training condition.\n\nTEACHING JAPANESE ADULTS THE [r]–[l] CONTRAST 93\nhension of meaningful connected speech. Thus, further\nevaluationof the effects of using exaggerated stimuli and\nan adaptive training regime in a study focused on speech\nidentification seems warranted.\nIt should be noted that the acoustic exaggeration we\nused was different in an important way from that used in\nprevious studies. Instead of increasing the salience of a\ngiven acoustic difference by making the critical stimulus\nregion louder or longer or making it stand out by remov-\ning its acoustic context (cf. Pruitt, Kawahara, Akahane-\nY amada, & Kubo, 1998), our method was designed to di-\nrectly increase the magnitude of the natural distinction\nbetween English [r] and [l]. Specifically , we enhancednat-\nurally occurring differences between tokens of [r] and [l]\nuttered in identical contexts (see the Method section).\nIn order to assess the effects of training, it was neces-\nsary to provide both a pre- and a posttraining test. We as-\nsessed both identificationof stimuli as tokens of [r] or [l]\nand discrimination of pairs of stimuli, using a same–\ndifferent (AX) discriminationtask (see the Method section\nfor details). No feedback was given during the test, but it\nis possible (and indeed, predicted by our Hebbian account,\nif some of the stimuli used are distinct enough) that the\npretest itself might have led to some improvement in per-\nformance. To control for such effects, an additionalgroup\nof subjects received the pre- and posttest without any\ntraining in between. The subjects in this group received\nthe pretest battery and then returned, after a 3-day delay,\nto take the posttest.\nWith the above aspects of the experiment in view, we\nwill review the predictions arising from our Hebbian ac-\ncount. Insofar as the stimuli used in the adaptive condi-\ntion are perceived as distinct, and under the assumption\nthat what is learned about a particular stimulus tends to\ngeneralize to very similar stimuli, the Hebbian approach\nwould lead us to predict that subjects would succeed in\nlearning the [r]–[l] distinction in the adaptive condition.\nAlthough no feedback is given during training or testing,\nnone should be necessary for learning, according to the\nHebbian account.This should result in improvementsboth\nin identification and in discrimination of [r] versus [l]\nstimuli after training.On the other hand, in the fixed con-\ndition, insofar as the subjects initially perceive the stimuli\nused in this condition as the same, we would predict that\nHebbian learning will, if anything,reinforce the tendency\nto hear them as the same, thereby preventing progress in\nlearning the [r]–[l] distinction, leading to the prediction\nthat there will be little or no improvement in identifica-\ntion or discrimination after training.\nA further prediction that arises from an unelaborated\nversion of the Hebbian account is that learning should be\nthe same with feedback as without it. If it is only the\nneural response that is elicited immediately by an input\nthat drives learning, we would still expect subjects in the\nadaptive condition to learn and subjects in the fixed con-\nditionto fail to learn, whetheror not theyare givenfeedback\non the accuracy of their responses. However, given the\nadaptivesignificanceof sensitivityto outcomes,not to men-\ntion the hugeliteratureon the role of positiveand negative\nreinforcement in learning, it would be surprising if feed-\nback played no role, and thus there may be reasons to sus-\npect that this unelaboratedversion of the Hebbian account\nwould turn out to be incorrect.However, there is relatively\nlittle data comparing learning with versus without feed-\nback, and thus a test of the hypothesis should lead to use-\nful information that may constrain the further elaboration\nof an adequate theory .\nTo assess the role of feedback,two additionalgroups of\nsubjects were run, using the same conditions described\nabove for the adaptive and the fixed training conditions\nwithout feedback, but this time with visual feedback pro-\nvided immediately after each identificationresponse dur-\ning the trainingphase of the experiment.In all otherways,\nthe trainingand testing of the subjectsin the two feedback\ngroups were the same as they were for the subjects in the\ncorresponding no-feedback conditions.\nAn important issue, with both practical and theoretical\nimplications, is the extent to which what is learned about\none minimal pair of stimuli exemplifying the [r]–[l] con-\ntrast in one specific phonologicalcontext (e.g., rock–lock)\ngeneralizes to other stimuli exemplifying the same con-\ntrast. This issue has been an important focus of a consid-\nerable body of prior research (Bradlow et al.,1999; Brad-\nlow et al., 1997; Lively et al., 1993; Lively et al., 1994). As\na small step toward addressing this issue as it arises within\nthe context of the present study, we trained each of our\nsubjects on one of two continua (rock–lock or road–load)\nand tested pre- and posttest performance not only on the\ntrained continuum,but also on the untrained,transfer con-\ntinuum, with each continuumused equallyoften for train-\ning and transfer within each group. It should be clear that\nthis test of generalizationis a limited one. The stimuli are\nspoken by the same individual, so generalization across\nspeakers is not assessed. Also, the contrast is in word-initial,\npre-vocalicpositionin both cases, so generalizationto other\npositions within the word is not assessed. Nevertheless, it\nis important to know whether the effects of training gen-\neralize even to this limited extentand, if so, what training\nconditionsfoster generalization.\nMETHOD\nStimulus Materials\nTwo synthetic speech continua were generated, one ranging from\nrockto lock, the other ranging fromroad to load. The stimuli for each\ncontinuum were based on recorded tokens of the two words spoken\nby a male native English speaker, sampled at 11.025 kHz with 16-\nbit quantization. Care was taken in selecting the base tokens so that\nthe pairs were acoustically matched in amplitude, fundamental fre-\nquency, and formant frequencies over their vowel portions, so that\ncross-splicings would be undetectable. The base stimuli were time\naligned on the basis of the formant transitions from the consonant to\nthe vowel. For each stimulus, an onset portion was defined as in-\ncluding the steady-state portion of the initial consonant and the tran-\nsitions, and a body portion was defined as including the acoustically\nmatched vowel–consonant portion of the syllable. The waveforms of\n94 M CCANDLISS, FIEZ, PROTOPAPAS, CONWAY , AND MCCLELLAND\nthe base stimuli were subjected to 14-pole linear predictive coding\n(LPC) analysis on 27.21-msec Hamming-windowed speech frames\nevery 9.07 msec, and the LPC coefficients were used to derive log\narea ratio coefficients of an equivalent vocal tract model (Rabiner &\nSchafer, 1978, p. 444). Estimates of the pitch tracks of the base stim-\nuli were derived using an auto-correlation algorithm and then man-\nually corrected and adjusted to match between the two base stimuli\nused for each continuum.\nA series of speech sounds ranging from [r] to [l] was generated\nfor each continuum, using vocal tract model coefficient values de-\ntermined by weighted averaging of coefficient values from the base\nstimuli, using the equationv(x) 5 v(l)+ x * [v(r) 2 v(l)], wherev(r)\nstands for the coefficients from the [ r] base and v(l) stands for the\ncoefficients at the corresponding time point from the [l] base, with\nx ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 in steps of 0.05. The stimuli constructed\nwith values ofv(l) equal to 0.0 or 1.0 (circled in Figure 1) are called\nanchor stimuli. Exaggerated stimuli were created by extrapolating\noutside the range of the two base stimuli by using the same formula\nwith values of x from 20.60 to 20.05 for exaggerated [l]-like\nsounds and from 1.05 to 1.60 for exaggerated [r]-like sounds. In\nevery case, only the onset portions of the stimuli were combined for\nthe interpolation or extrapolation; the body coefficients were always\ntaken from the [r] base stimulus.\nThe resulting vocal tract model coefficient sets were converted to\nLPC coefficients, and all the stimuli were synthesized by direct ap-\nplication of the recursive LPC filter equations with pitch-synchronous\ninterpolation of parameters throughout.\nTwelve University of Pittsburgh undergraduates whose first lan-\nguage was English were used to determine native identification func-\ntions for both continua. Stimuli from a given continuum were randomly\nordered within separate blocks. For each continuum, each subject\nheard 8 presentations of 23 stimuli constructed as above, with val-\nues of x ranging from 20.6 to 1.6 in steps of 0.10, and was asked to\nindicate whether each began with [r] or [l] (stimuli were constructed\nat 0.05 intervals; however, we obtainednormative data only at 0.1 in-\ntervals). The subjects heard an additional 20 presentations each of\nthe 11 stimuli from 0.0 to 1.0. Some of the extreme stimuli sounded\nunnatural to most listeners. Typically, the onsets would be dispro-\nportionately loud, or the stimuli would be described as having\n“weird metallic overtones.” This may be inevitable given the need to\ncreate marked exaggerations. What is important is that the resulting\ngroup identification functions showed that each continuum could be\ndivided into three regions: one in which all the stimuli were reliably\n( p> 90%) identified as beginning with [l], one in which all the stim-\nuli were reliably identified (p > 90%) as beginning with [r], and one\nover which the stimuli showed a sigmoidal transition from reliable\nidentification as [l] to reliable identification as [r]. For each contin-\nuum, a pair of stimuli were chosen to be the fixed training stimuli.\nThos\ne were the most similar pair of stimuli with the property that one\nwas reliably identified by the native English subjects as [r] and the\nother was reliably identified by the native English subjects as [l]\n(Figure 1).\nSubjects\nForty adult Japanese subjects residing in or near Pittsburgh were\nused overall, 8 in each of the four training conditions and 8 in the\ncontrol condition. Every subject met the following criteria: He or\nshe (1) had been born in Japan and had lived there at least until 18\nyears of age and (2) had performed at or below 70% accuracy in dis-\ncriminating the fixed training stimuli on at least one of the two con-\ntinua during the same–different judgment task in the pretest. The\nsubjects were pseudorandomly assigned to the different conditions,\nwithin the constraints that pretest performance had to be less than\n70% on the continuum to be used in training and overall pretest per-\nformance of all of the training groups and of the control group should\nbe roughly equivalent.\nTraining and Testing Procedures\nBefore and after training (or for control subjects, before and after\na 3-day test–retest delay interval), each subject was given a test battery\nto assess ability to identify and discriminate stimuli from each of the\ntwo continua. Each test was administered separately for each of the\ntwo continua, with the rock–lock continuum always tested before\nroad–load. The identification task, always administered first in the\nbattery, required the subject to indicate, by pressing one of two but-\ntons, whether a word began with [r] or [l], without feedback. Before\nthe test on each continuum, the subjects were giventhree labeled in-\nstances of each of the two anchor stimuli. For each continuum, the\nsubject received 132 trials in a random order, consisting of 12 instances\nof the anchor stimuli and 12 instances of the interpolated stimuli\nspaced 0.1 units apart along the continuum. Next came the discrim-\nination test, which required the subjects to indicate whether a pair of\nstimuli were the same or different. Two variants of the discrimina-\ntion task were used. In the first variant, the subjects received 48 tri-\nals that used only the two anchor stimuli. Each AX pair consisted of\nboth [r] anchors, both [l] anchors, or one [r] and one [l] anchor. This\nvariant proved relatively easy for all the subjects, and performance\non this variant was not further analyzed. In the second variant, called\nthe expand test, eight stimulus pairs from each continuum were used,\nwith the members of each pair centered around the midpoint of the\ntransition from [l] to [r] in English speakers (0.35 for load–road,\n0.45 for lock–rock) and spanned separations ranging from 0.1 (most\ndifficult) to 1.5 (least difficult) in equal intervals, with a separation\nof 1.0 corresponding to the separation between the anchor stimuli on\neach continuum. For each continuum, each subject received 192 tri-\nals in random order, consisting of 24 trials based on each pair. In half\nof the trials, the two different members were used as stimuli, so that\nthe correct response was different; otherwise, one of the two stimuli\nwas presented twice, so that the correct response wassame. For each\ncontinuum, the fixed training stimuli served as one of the eight pairs,\nand performance on these stimuli was used as the basis for subject se-\nlection, as indicated above. All of the above tests were administered\nboth in the pretest and in the posttest. One additional discrimination test\nwas administered in the posttest only. This test, called theslide test,\nmade use of stimuli with a separation of 0.3, centered at 0.15, 0.25,\n0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, and 0.85 on each continuum. As with the\nexpand test, half of the stimulus pairs weresame pairs, and the other\nhalf weredifferent. A total of 128 trials, consisting of 16 trials with each\npair, was administered in random order for each continuum.\nEach subject in the study took home a portable computer to com-\nplete three training sessions on separate days. Each session took ap-\nproximately 20 min to complete. Within each training session, the\nsubjects were presented with 480 training trials, in which one of two\nsynthesized speech tokens (an [r] token or an [l] token) was selected\nat random, subject to the constraint that each group of 20 trials con-\ntained an equal number of [r] and [l] stimuli. The subjects indicated\nwhether the word began with [r] or [l] by pressing one of two but-\ntons. Each response was simply recorded by the computer in the no-\nfeedback conditions. In the feedback conditions, correct responses\nwere followed immediately by a row of three green check marks,\nwhereas er\nrors were followed by a row of three redx characters. In\nthe fixed training condition, the same 2 fixed training stimuli were\nused in all training trials (0.1 vs. 0.6 for load–road, and 0.2 vs. 0.7\nfor lock–rock). For the adaptive training condition, a set of 38 stim-\nulus pairs was created for each continuum. The pairs were con-\nstructed around the midpoint between the fixed training stimuli, and\nthe distance between the members of each stimulus pair ranged from\n0.1 (Level 0, hardest) to 1.95 (Level 37, easiest). The pairs were con-\nstructed by starting with the Level 0 pair, then alternating between\ndecreasing the x value of the [l]-side stimulus and increasing the x\nvalue of the [r]-side stimulus by 0.05. All the subjects in the adap-\ntive condition initially began training at Level 30 ( 20.45 vs. 1.15\nfor the road–load continuum and 20.35 vs. 1.25 for the rock–lock\nTEACHING JAPANESE ADULTS THE [r]–[l] CONTRAST 95\ncontinuum; see Figure 1). Whenever a subject made an error, the\nstimuli were switched to the next easier pair. Whenever a subject\nmade eight consecutive correct responses, the stimuli were switched\nto the next harder pair. At the beginning of each training session and\nagain after every block of 20 training stimuli, there were 2 probe tri-\nals, 1 with each of the 2 fixed training stimuli for the continuum in\nuse for the given subject, for a total of 50 probe trials per session.\nPerformance on the probe stimuli was not considered in adjusting\nthe training stimuli, but the subjects in the feedback conditions did\nreceive feedback on their responses to these stimuli.\nAfter completion of the posttest, as described above, 4 of the sub-\njects in each training group (2 trained with rock–lock and 2 trained\nwith road–load) were assigned to continue in the identical training\ncondition for an additional three sessions. After the additional train-\ning, these subjects received an additional test, called the final\nposttest, identical to the test previously administered at the end of the\nfirst 3 days of training.\nRESULTS\nWe will beginby consideringthe effects of trainingwith-\nout feedback,focusingon the key contrastbetweenthe adap-\ntive and the fixed training conditions.We then will consider\nwhether the results were the same when feedback was used.\nEffects of Training Without Feedback\nIn accordance with the predictions of the Hebbian ac-\ncount,the subjectsin the adaptivetrainingconditiondemon-\nstrated substantialgains in identifyingstimuli on the contin-\nuum used in training (Figure 2, upper left), even without\nfeedback. The pretraining identificationfunction was fairly\nflat, indicatingpoor identification,consistentwith the poor\ninitialdiscriminationof these stimuli,which was a condition\nof the subjects’inclusionin the study .After training in the\nadaptivecondition,the groupidentificationfunctiontookon\na sigmoid shape. Stimuli on the [l] end of the acousticcon-\ntinuum were reliably identified as beginningwith [l], and\nthere was a cleartransitionleadingto a region overwhich the\nstimuli were reliably identified as beginning with [r]. As-\nsessment of the statistical significance of training effects\nwas based on the difference between the slopes of best-\nfitting logisticregression functions applied to each subject’ s\npre- and posttrainingidentificationdata,\n1 using one-tailed\ntests unless otherwise indicated.The slope differences were\nsignificantlygreaterthan0 in the adaptivecondition[ t(7) 5\n4.90, p< .001], and every subject in this conditionshowed\nan increase in the slope. An improvementfrom the pretest\nto the posttest was also exhibited by the control group,\nwhich received no trainingbetween the pre- and the posttest\n[t(7) 5 2.88, p 5 .012]\n2 (Figure 3, top). Therefore, it be-\ncame important to contrast the slope difference found in the\ncontrol group with the value obtainedin the adaptivegroup.\nImportantly , the adaptivegroupshowed greaterchangefrom\nthe pre- to the posttest than did the control group, as indi-\ncated by a larger slope difference for adaptive subjects than\nfor control subjects [t(14) 53.10, p 5 .004].\nEven though the adaptive training conditiondid lead to\nthe emergence of fairly sharp identificationfunctions,these\nFigure 2. Mean categorization functions (with standard error bars) for two groups of Japanese subjects\n(n 5 8) before and after three 20-min training sessions in the adaptive condition (left) or the fixed condi-\ntion (right) without feedback. Pre- and posttest performance is shown on the continuum used in training\n(upper panels)and on the other continuum used to assess transfer (bottom panels).\n\n96 M CCANDLISS, FIEZ, PROTOPAPAS, CONWAY , AND MCCLELLAND\nfunctions were shifted relative to those of native speakers.\nFor the native speakers, we calculated the crossoverpoint\nfor each continuum and obtained a mean value of 0.391\n(SD 5 0.064). For the Japanese subjects in the adaptive\ncondition,the mean locus of the crossoverpointwas 0.586\n(SD 5 0.141). The difference was highly significant\n[t(29) 55.390, p< .001]. Thus, the adaptivesubjects had\nlearned to distinguish the [l] and the [r] categories, but\ntheir boundary appeared to be in a different place than that\nof native English speakers.\nFigure 4 provides examples of individualsubjects’pat-\nternsof progress duringtrainingin the adaptivetrainingcon-\ndition.The separation of the stimuli at each point in train-\ning is indicated,and a separation of 1.0 correspondsto the\nseparation of the natural speech tokens (the anchor stim-\nuli in Figure 1). Even though stimuli were initially exag-\ngerated, nearly all the subjects made some errors at first,\ncausing the training algorithm to present even more exag-\ngerated stimuli, until the limit of our constructedset of ex-\naggeratedstimuli was reached.After working with the most\nexaggeratedstimuli for a brief period, some subjects, such\nas the one shown at the top of the figure, showed rapid\nprogress within the first training session and continuedto\nprogress to the point where they were reliably labeling\nstimuli well within the range of the actual spoken items.\nOther subjects—for example, the one whose data are\nshown in the middle of the figure—exhibited slower and/\nor more erratic progress. We also had 3 subjects(such as the\none shown at the bottomof the figure) who did not progress\nbeyond the most exaggerated stimuli within the three\ntraining sessions. T wo of these subjects showed improve-\nment, as measured by percentage of correct identifications\nof the most extreme stimuli,and the 3rd apparentlymapped\nthe stimuli to the wrong responses during training but ex-\nhibited differentiation of the stimuli in his responses (i.e.,\nhis accuracy was farless than chance). All 3 of these sub-\njects showed clear improvementin the posttest. These sub-\njects all undertook three further sessions of training after\nthe posttest, and all 3 progressed to less exaggerated stim-\nuli during these additional training sessions (the subject\nwho had the stimuli mapped to the wrong responses\nremapped them to the correct responses in the second 3\ndays of training). Thus,even the subjects with the poorest\ninitial ability to respond differentially to [r] and [l] stim-\nuli made progress in the adaptive training condition.\nWe turn now to the group of subjects who received train-\ning with the fixed stimuli, where the Hebbian account pre-\ndicts there should be no effect of training,given that these\nstimuli are initiallydifficult for our Japanese adult subjects\nto discriminate. As was predicted, this group showed a\nsmaller slope difference between the pre- and the posttest\nfor the stimuli used in training than was found for the\nadaptive group [t(14) 5 2.01, p 5 .032; Figure 2, upper\nright]. Althoughthis group did exhibita slight improvement\nfrom the pretest to the posttest [t(7) 5 2.31, p 5 .021], this\neffect was not reliably different from the improvement\nseen in the control group [t(14) 5 0.67, p 5 .256].\nEffects of training on discrimination. According to the\nHebbian hypothesis, our adaptive training regime, using\nstimuli that subjects tend to perceive as different, not only\nshould increase the ability to apply correct labels to stim-\nuli, but also shouldenhancediscriminationbetweenthem.\nSuch a training effect should not be obtainedif subjectsare\ntrained in the fixed condition,using stimulithey tend to per-\nceive as the same. Here, we will consider evidence bear-\ning on these predictionsfrom the expand and the slide tests.\nIn the expand test, we obtained clear evidence that train-\ning improved discrimination in the adaptive condition\n(Figure 5, top left) but little sign of a training effect in the\nfixed condition (Figure 5, top right). An analysis of vari-\nance performed on the pre- versus posttest data from the\nadaptive condition produced a main effect of test [pretest\nvs. posttest, F(1,7) 5 45.835, p< .001], as well as a main\neffect of the stimulus separation variable [ F(7,49) 5\n26.147, p< .001]. Although a pretest–posttest difference\nFigure 3.

Bottom: mean discrimination performance graphed\nagainst the separation of the discriminative stimuli (with stan-\ndard error bars) for the same subjects under the same conditions.\nData are collapsed over the two continua, both of which were\ntested in the pretest and the posttest.\n\nTEACHING JAPANESE ADULTS THE [r]–[l] CONTRAST 97\ndoes not appear for the smallest separations, the interac-\ntion of pre- versus posttest with separation was not sig-\nnificant [ F(7,49) 5 1.603, p 5 .157]. A corresponding\nanalysis on the data from the fixed condition produced\nonly a main effect of separation [ F(7,49) 5 34.143, p<\n.001] and no evidenceof a pretest–posttest difference. In-\nterestingly , the control condition(Figure 3, bottom panel)\nproduced a slight but clear improvement from the first to\nthe second test [F(1,7) 5 9.697, p 5 .017], along with a\nmain effect of separation [ F(7,49) 5 36.274, p< .001].\nAlthough the magnitude of the pre- to posttest improve-\nment did not differ reliably between the fixed and the con-\ntrol conditions, the finding of a significant pre- versus\nposttest effect in the control condition and no such effect\nafter fixed training hintsat the possibilitythat fixed train-\ning may have tended to reverse a slight improvement in\ndiscrimination owing to the experience with the pretest.\nIn the slide test, if training is effective in inducing a per-\nceptual distinction between [r] and [l] stimuli, we would\nexpect to find an accuracy increase for stimuli that strad-\ndle the crossover point in the posttraining identification\nfunctions.There was evidenceof such an effect in the adap-\nFigure 4.

Separation was increased by 0.05 after each incorrect response and decreased by the same amount\nafter each run of eight consecutive correct responses. See the Method section for details. Note that al-\nthough Subject 56 did not progress beyond the most extreme separation level, there was some e vidence\nof learning, since this subject progressed from an accuracy level of 76% on Day 1 to 82% on Day 3, a re-\nliable increase ( p\n5 .011).\n\n98 M CCANDLISS, FIEZ, PROTOPAPAS, CONWAY , AND MCCLELLAND\ntive condition, but no evidence of a training effect in the\nfixed condition.The slide test was not administeredduring\nthe pretest, so statistical testing focused on posttest per-\nformance, comparing performance of the subjects with ei-\nther adaptive or fixed training with the control subjects.\nAn analysis of variance on the adaptivetrainingversus con-\ntrol data revealed a main effect of training [adaptive vs.\ncontrol, F(1,14) 5 4.740, p 5 .047] and a main effect of\nposition [ F(7,98) 5 8.756, p< .001] but no interaction\n[F(7,98) 5 1.397, p 5 .215]. Even though the interaction\nwas not significant,post hoc one-tailed t tests were carried\nout to determineat which pointsthe discriminationcurves\ndiffered between the adaptive and the control conditions.\nThe differences were reliable at midpoint positions 0.45\n( p 5 .026) and 0.55 ( p 5 .002) and approached reliabil-\nity at 0.65 ( p 5 .053). The positions of the reliable or\nnear-reliable differences (0.45–0.65) correspondedto that\nportion of the [r]–[l] continuum near the crossover point\n(M 5 0.586, SD 50.141, as was reported above) for [l]\nversus [r] identification responses in the posttest identifi-\ncation data for these subjects (Figure 2, top left). In con-\ntrast to these findings, an anal ysis comparing fixed train-\ning versus control yielded only a main effect of position\n[F(7,98) 5 5.795, p< .001], and there was no significant\ndifference between the fixed and the control performance\nat any point (of the eight one-tailed p values, the smallest\nwas .233). In summary, adaptive training led to reliable\nimprovements in discrimination at intermediate points\nalong the [r]–[l] continuum, but not elsewhere, and fixed\ntraining produced no evidence of such an improvement.\nGeneralizationof the effects of training to the trans-\nfer continuum. Because the subjects were tested on a sec-\nond continuum not used in training, we were able to con-\nsider whether there was any evidence of transfer.\nConsidering first the identification results, data for the\ntransfer continuumfor the subjectsfrom both the adaptive\nand the fixed training conditions are shown in the lower\npanels of Figure 2. An analysis of variance indicated a\nslightimprovementfrom the pre- to the posttest[F(1,14) 5\n7.685, p 5 .015], but the size of the improvement did not\ndiffer between the two groups [ F(1,14) 5 2.483, p 5\n.137],and the subjectswho received trainingdid not show\na greater improvement than that of the control subjects\n[t(22) 5 0.676, p 5 .253].

Without further elaboration, then, a Hebbian\naccount would predict that the effects of adaptiveand fixed\ntrainingwould be the same with and without feedback. We\nbegin our consideration of this matter by examining the\nidentification performance of the subjects who received\nfeedback in the adaptiveand nonadaptivetraining regimes.\nAs can be seen in Figure 6 (top panels), both the fixed and\nthe adaptive group showed a clear increase in the slope of\ntheir identification functions from the pretest to the\nposttest [t(7) 5 2.48, p 5 0.21 for the adaptivegroup and\nt(7) 5 3.41, p 5 .006 for the fixed training group], and\nboth groups showed larger gains than did the no-training\ncontrol group [ t(14) 5 1.94, p 5 .036 for adaptive vs.\ncontrol and t(14) 5 2.70, p 5 .009 for fixed vs. control].\nThere was no significantdifference in the gains shown by\nthe two feedback groups [ t(14) 52 0.17, p > .5]. Fur-\nthermore, a direct comparison of the fixed training group\ntrained with feedback versus the fixed/no-feedback group\nindicated a reliably larger gain from training with feed-\nback than from training without it [t(14) 5 2.24, p 5 .021].\nThis finding clearly contradicts the prediction of the Heb-\nbian approach that feedback should not make any dif fer-\nence. There was no significantdifference, however, in the\ngain shown by the two adaptive groups [ t(14) 5 0.677,\np 5 .255]. Once again, the boundary between categories\nexhibitedby the two feedback groups (0.623, SD 5 0.051\nfor the adaptivegroupand 0.589, SD 5 0.087 for the fixed\ngroup) differed from the boundary seen in native English\nspeakers [0.391, SD 5 0.064, as was previously noted;\nt(29) 5 9.211, p< .001 for the adaptive group vs. native\nspeakers and t(29) 5 6.868, p< .001 for the fixed group\nvs. native speakers].\nEffects of training on discrimination. In line with the\nidentificationdata, trainingwith feedback led to cleargains\nin discrimination between [r] and [l] stimuli, for both the\nfixed and the adaptive training regime (Figure 7). Consid-\nering first the performance in the expand test, an analysis\nof variance performed on the pre- vs. posttest data from\nthe adaptive condition produced a main effect of training\n[posttest vs. pretest, F(1,7) 5 7.835, p 5.026], as well as\na main effect of the stimulusseparationvariable[F(7,49) 5\n58.214, p< .001], and there was a trend toward a reliable\ninteraction [F(7,49) 5 2.032, p 5 .070]. A corresponding\nanalysis of the data from the fixed condition produced a\nmain effect of separation [F(7,49) 5 34.143, p< .001] and\nFigure 6. Mean categorization functions (with standard error bars) for two groups of Japanese subjects\n(n 5 8) before and after three 20-min training sessions in the adaptive condition (left) or the fixed condi-\ntion (right) with feedback.

An analysis of variance on the adaptive train-\ning versus control data revealed a main effect of training\n[adaptive vs. control, F(1,14) 5 4.719, p 5 .048] and a\nmain effect of position [F(7,98) 5 8.713, p< .001], with\na trend toward an interaction [F(7,98) 5 1.910, p 5 .076].\nA corresponding analysis comparing fixed training versus\ncontrolyieldeda main effect of training [F(1,14) 5 5.097,\np 5 .040], a main effect of position [ F(7,98) 5 12.538,\np< .001], and a highly reliable interaction [ F(7,98) 5\n5.451, p< .001]. The peak in the discrimination function\nlanded at 0.55 for the adaptive condition and at 0.65 for\nthe fixed condition, in both cases falling near the\ncrossover point in the identificationfunctions (M 5 0.589,\nSD 5 0.087 for the adaptive group andM 5 0.623, SD 5\n0.064 for the fixed group). Such a pattern indicates that\nthe feedback subjects were able to establish distinct per-\nceptualcategoriescorrespondingto [r] and [l], albeit with\na different placement of the boundary between the cate-\ngories than we found in native speakers.\nGeneralization after training with feedback .I nt h e\nidentification data for the transfer continuum (Figure 6,\nbottom), there was a large overall improvement from the\npre- to the posttest [ F(1,14) 5 19.042, p< .001] and no\ndifference in the size of the improvement for the subjects\nreceiving fixed versus adaptivetraining [F(1,14) 5 0.475,\np 5 .502]. A one-tailedt test supportedthe hypothesisthat\nthe improvement shown by the two groups of feedback\nsubjects combined was significantly greater than the pre-\nto posttest improvement exhibited by the control subjects\n[t(1,22) 5 1.95, p 5 .032]. As with the trained continuum,\nthe crossover points of the identification functions were\nhigher for our Japanese subjects than they were for native\nspeakers [M 5 0.621, SD 5 0.110 for the adaptive train-\ning group andM 5 0.621, SD 5 0.077 for the fixed group,\nboth significantly different from native speakers, t(29) 5\n7.284, p< .001 and t(29) 58.480, p< .001,respectively].\nThere was also some slight evidenceof transfer in the dis-\ncrimination data after fixed training (Figure 8). In the ex-\npand test, there was a main effect of training in an analy-\nsis of variance carried out on discrimination performance\nin the fixed training condition[F(1,7) 5 7.373, p 5 .030].\nIn the slide test, there was a trend after fixed training to-\nward increased discriminationfor stimuli bracketing 0.45,\nFigure 7.

There was no sign of a statisticallyreliable trans-\nfer effect after adaptive training in the expand test, and al-\nthoughthere were some signs of improvementin the slide\ntest, the effect was not statistically reliable.\nProgress in the Different Training Conditions\nThe evidence presented thus far is quite clear in estab-\nlishingthat the availabilityof feedback can have a dramatic\neffect on learning, at least when subjects are trained with\nfixed stimuli that are initially difficult for them to discrim-\ninate. To provide further evidencerelevant to this issue, we\ncompared the performances of all four groups on the\nprobe trials that employedthe fixed training stimuli. Group\naverage performance on these probe trials as a function of\ntraining (as reflected in successive sets of 10 test trials\ncovering successive groups of 100 training trials) are\nshown in Figure 9 for all four groups. Note that the sub-\njects in the two feedbackgroupsreceived feedback on these\nprobe trials, whereas the subjects in the two no-feedback\ngroups did not receive feedback. Note further that for the\nsubjects in the two fixed training groups, such trials were\nin no way different from the ongoing training trials. For\nthe subjects in the two adaptive groups, such trials could\ndiffer in that the probe stimulimight not be the same as the\ntraining stimuli in use at that point in training.\nIt is evidentfrom the data in this figure that the subjects\nreceiving fixed training with feedback showed very rapid\ngains and the best performance overall, whereas the sub-\njects in the fixed-training/no-feedback group showed lit-\ntle improvement. The subjects in the two adaptive condi-\ntions produced intermediateresults.

In a follow-up two-way analysis of vari-\nance focusing on the two fixed training conditions, there\nwas a main effect of feedback [ F(1,14) 5 11.273, p 5\n.005] and session [F(2,28) 5 7.014, p 5 .003]. The interac-\ntionwas not significant[F(2,28)5 1.157,p 5 .329]. In con-\ntrast, in a parallelanalysisfocusingon the two adaptivecon-\nFigure 8.

The fixed–feedback\nsubjects were 59% correct in identifying these stimuli in\nthe pretest, identicalto the overall mean of the four groups,\nand an analysis of variance revealed no reliable initial dif-\nferences among the groups. We also examined discrimina-\ntion as measured in the expand task and found that the\nmean discriminationaccuracy of the fixed–feedbackgroup\nwas 67% correct, just below the overall mean of 68% cor-\nrect over all four training groups. For the actual fixed\ntraining stimuli, which constituted one of the expand test\npairs, the fixed–feedback group achieved an accuracy of\n54% correct, one percentage point above the mean of 53%\ncorrect for this pair over all four groups. An overall analy-\nsis of variance on the expand pretest results revealed no re-\nliable effect of group and no interaction of group with the\ndegree of separation of the members of the expand test\npair. Overall, it appears that the subjects in the fixed–\nfeedback group were not distinguishable from the other\ngroups before the beginning of training. Thus, their ad-\nvantage on the first set of probe trials seems most likely to\nreflect the onset of an advantage for fixed training with\nfeedback within the first 100 trials of the experiment.\nEffects of Further Training\nThe effects of 3 additionaldays of training were assessed\nby considering the performance of the 4 subjects, in each\nexperimental condition, who received a second round of\n3 days of trainingunderidenticaltrainingconditions.A com-\nparison of the performances of this subset of subjects on\nthe 3-day posttest versus the final posttest is shown for\neach of the four training conditions in Figure 10. For all\ngroups, the 3-day posttest identification functions were\nquite similar to the posttest identification functions shown\npreviously (see Figures 2 and 6), and an analysis of vari-\nance performed on the 3-day posttest data (with the slope\nof the best-fitting logistic regression function as the de-\npendent variable) revealed no main effects or interactions\ninvolving a factor that distinguished those who received\ncontinued training and those who did not. Thus, it appears\nthat each subgroup that was given further training was rep-\nresentative of the larger group from which it was derived.\nBecause of the small number of subjects in each sub-\ngroup, statistical comparisons between the groups are too\nweak to provide useful information, and there is no con-\ntrol availablefor assessing the extent to which any further\nimprovementsshown by these subjects can be attributed to\nthe effects of the 3-day posttest, rather than to the effects\nof the additionaltraining per se. Nevertheless, the data may\nbe worth examiningfor signs that effects of training with-\nout feedback that were absentafter 3 days of training might\nbegin to appear with additional training experience. Be-\nfore turning to these matters, wenote that in the feedback\nconditions (bottom panels), further training had only a\nsmall effect on the identificationfunctionsover and above\nthe effects already produced by the first 3 days of training.\nThe results in Figure 10 suggest that a second 3 days of\ntraining may have led to some improvement in identifica-\ntion performance of at least some of the subjects in the\nfixed–no-feedback condition. Indeed, 3 of the 4 subjects\nin this group showed a slope increase from the 3-day\nposttest to the final test (the remaining subject produced\na flat identification function and stayed at chance across\nall 6 days of training). The results cannot unequivocallybe\ntaken as evidenceof an effect of the training procedure per\nse in this condition,because there is no control for the ef-\nfects of the 3-day posttest on performance on the final test.\nHowever, the fact that this group showed no improvement\non the transfer continuum does provide some reason to\nsuspect that the improvement seen on the trained contin-\nuum was not due solely to the effects of the 3-day posttest.\nWith so few subjects, statistical confirmation of this dif-\nference is lacking, so once again we must stress that the\ndata do not unequivocally indicate that there was a real\ntraining effect. At the same time, given the prediction that\nfixed training without feedback should produce no bene-\nfit, it seems important to acknowledgethe possibilitythat\nextended training without feedback may produce a bene-\nficial effect at least for some subjects.\nThe results in Figure 10 also providesome indicationthat\nwith three extra training sessions, adaptive training with-\nFigure 9.

Again, firm conclusions\nare not possible,owing to the absence of a controlfor the ef-\nfects of the 3-day posttest, but the data are at least sugges-\ntive that a total of 6 days of adaptivetraining without feed-\nback can produce a transfer effect.\nThe discrimination data were somewhat noisier than\nthe identification data, and there were no clear indications\nthat further training led to further improvements in dis-\ncrimination.\nDISCUSSION\nOur experiments were designedto test predictionsaris-\ning from a Hebbian account of the mechanisms underly-\ning the acquisitionand stabilizationof speech perception.\nAccording to the Hebbian account,the acquisitionof one’ s\nnative language can lead to the formation of a strong ten-\ndency to treat certain nonnative stimuli as the same. This\ntendencymay be self-reinforcing,leadingto its maintenance\neven when it is counterproductive,perhaps accounting in\npart for the difficulty Japanese adults have in acquiring\nthe English contrast between [r] and [l]. The basis for this\nis the idea that the mechanisms of learning may tend to\nreinforce whatever reaction the brain has to a particular\nstimulus.Two predictionsgenerated from the Hebbianac-\ncount were borne out in the no-feedback conditions of our\nexperiment.\nFirst, the Hebbian account predicts that subjects who re-\nceive exposure to stimuli they perceive as the same should\nfail to benefit from training, even with hundreds of trials\nof exposure. In accord with this prediction, the group re-\nceiving training without feedback, with fixed stimuli that\nwere difficult for them to discriminate,showed no evidence\nof learning after 3 days of training,once the slightgain at-\ntributable to exposure to the pretest was taken into ac-\ncount. Second, the Hebbian account predicts that subjects\nwho receive exposure to stimuli that theycan discriminate\nshould benefit from that exposure, even if they receive no\nfeedback on their accuracy in identifyingthese stimuli. In\nsupport of this, we found that the group receiving adaptive\ntraining,without feedback, in which initially exaggerated\nstimuli were used showed considerablegains in both iden-\ntification and discrimination, when compared with a no-\ntraining control and when compared with the group re-\nceiving fixed training with difficult stimuli.\nThe findings are consistent with the idea that the self-\nreinforcing nature of Hebbian learning might play a role in\ndetermininghow experienceshapes and maintainsthe per-\nceptual categorization of speech. Further support is pro-\nvided by simulations(McClellandet al., 1999; Thomas &\nMcClelland, 1997) using a Hebbian learning rule within\na network based on Kohonen’ s self-organizingmap archi-\ntecture (Kohonen, 1982). The network embodies assump-\ntions similar to those of Kuhl’ s native language magnet\nmodel(Iverson & Kuhl, 1995;Kuhl, 1993)and Flege’ s SLM\n(Flege, 1995), and a network model similar to ours in\nsome ways haspreviouslybeen used to simulatelanguage-\nspecific perceptual magnet effects (Guenther & Gjaja,\n1996).In oursimulations,“English”networkswere exposed\nfrom their initialization to an English-like training envi-\nronment, including two patterns analogous to [r] and [l],\nwhereas “Japanese” networks were exposed instead to a\nJapanese-like environment that included just one pattern\nbetween the [r] and the [l] analogues. The English net-\nworks developed distinct representations for the [r] and\nthe [l] analogues, whereas the Japanese networks devel-\noped a single representation to which they mapped both\nthe [r] and the [l] inputs. We found that this representation\npersisted indefinitelyin the Japanese networks if they were\nswitched overto the English-liketraining environment,il-\nlustrating how Hebbian learning can maintain a single\nrepresentation for two different inputs, once that repre-\nsentation has been established. However, as with our sub-\njects, the Japanese networks could be remediated by using\nexaggerated training stimuli to produce distinct represen-\ntations for the [r] and the [l] analogues. Once elicited,\nthese distinct representations were strengthened by the op-\neration of the learning mechanism, producing rapid\nchange in perception, similar to what we have seen in our\nexperiment.\nAs was previously noted, the data provided some sug-\ngestion of a beneficial effect of a second set of 3 days of\nfixed training without feedback in 3 of the 4 subjects who\ncontinuedtraining beyond the first 3 days. Such a finding\nruns counter to the Hebbian account as we have stated it\nthus far, but the predictionof absolutelyno learningin the\nno-feedback/f ixed-trainingconditiondepends on the idea\nthat the representationselicitedby the two alternativestim-\nuli are absolutelyidentical.If they tend to be even slightly\ndifferent (e.g., if they involvethe activationof largely , but\nnot completely , overlappingpopulationsof neurons), Heb-\nbian learning may strengthen the connections supporting\nthe nonoverlapping aspects of the representations pro-\nmoting gradual differentiation. Just such a gradual differ-\nentiation effect may underlie the improvement seen in\nJapanese adults who have been exposed to English as\nadults for extended periods (Flege et al., 1996). We have\nseen in our modeling work (McClelland et al., 1999) that\nthis can lead to a gradual process of differentiation.In the\nmodel, such differentiation is facilitated when the only\nitems being processed are the two overlapping but not\nidentical inputs. We will return to this point below when\nwe consider the differences between naturalistic learning\nconditionsand the conditionsof our experiments.\nAlthough two predictions of the Hebbian account were\nsupported by our experiment,it is clear from the data from\nthe feedbackconditionsthat the Hebbian accountis, at best,\nincomplete.In contrastto the fixed training conditionwith-\nout feedback, fixed training with feedback produced very\nrobust learning. Indeed, the subjects in this condition\nshowed learning as good as and, by some measures, slightly\nbetter than the subjects who received adaptivetraining with\nfeedback. The findingthat learning was so effective in the\nTEACHING JAPANESE ADULTS THE [r]–[l] CONTRAST 105\nfixed training condition with feedback may be somewhat\nsurprising, given the apparent benefits of an adaptive\ntraining regime in the studies reported in Merzenich et al.\n(1996) and Tallal et al. (1996). It should be noted, how-\never, that there are very large differences between our\nstudy and theirs, and we would not want to suggest that the\nuse of feedback would always eliminate an advantage for\nadaptive training, relative to fixed training. In particular,\nour subjectswere all highlymotivatedadultswho may have\nbeen able to tolerate more frustration during early stages of\nfixed training than the language-impairedchildren used in\nMerzenich et al.’ s and Tallal et al.’ s studies.\nIn any case, our findingthat feedback does make a very\nlarge difference, at least in the fixed training conditionsof\nour experiment, makes it clear that Hebb’ s idea about the\nbasis of changes in the strengths of connections between\nneurons does not provide a full account of the factors that\ninfluence perceptual learning. One response to this situa-\ntion might be to call into question the Hebbian approach\nand to consider whether it should be abandoned in favor\nof other approaches. Within the domain of connectionistor\nneural models, one alternative approach to accountingfor\nour findings could be constructed on the basis of error-\ndriven, instead of Hebbian, learning (Rescorla & Wagner,\n1972; Rosenblatt, 1962; Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams,\n1986).Althoughwe certainlycannotrule such approaches\nout, we nevertheless believe that the Hebbian approach\nhas considerable merit. It provides a mechanism that can\nbe used to allow a system to organize in response to expe-\nrience, even when no feedback is available. This type of\nlearning appears to us to be highly relevant to the initial\nshaping and stabilizationof the neural mechanisms of per-\nception in other modalities, including vision (Linsker,\n1986a, 1986b, 1986c; Miller, Keller, & Stryker, 1989), as\nwell as for the formation of speech categoriesin the absence\nof feedback or category labels, as was discussed above.\nWe therefore favor proposals in which Hebbian learning\nplays a role, and either is combined with error-correcting\nlearning methods (O’Reilly , 1996, 1998) or is modulated\nby outcome information, as in reinforcement learning\n(Barto, 1994). A challenge for a model based on these\nideas will be to explain why fixed training with feedback\ncan lead to learning that is at least as good as or betterthan\nadaptive training under some conditions. This is a matter\nwe intend to consider in ongoing modeling studies.\nOur research has been motivated by the Hebbian ac-\ncount of learning we have discussed throughout this arti-\ncle, but we do not wish to suggest that our findingsprovide\nunique support for a Hebbian approach to understanding\nthe acquisitionof a new phonologicaldistinctionin adult-\nhood. Quite apart from this approach, there are other ideas\nand considerations that may be relevant to understanding\nthe perceptuallearningprocess and the role of feedback in\nour experiments. For example, it might be suggested that\nboth exaggerationand feedback facilitate learning by call-\ning a subject’ s attentionto the cuesthat distinguishthe train-\ning stimuli. This suggestion provides one way of offering\na unifiedaccountof ouridentificationfindings,since both\nexaggerationand feedback would be operatingto produce\nthe same effect. One can easily see how exaggerationcould\nhelp orient attention, since exaggeration would make the\ndifferencesbetweenthe stimulihighlysalient.Waysin which\nfeedback can operate in directingattentionto distinguish-\ning cues have been exploredby several investigators.For ex-\nample, Kruschke (1992) has introduced mechanisms that\nallow the explicit adjustment,on the basis of feedback, of\nattention weights assigned to particular stimulus dimen-\nsions. A second idea is that feedback may allow subjectsto\nassociate the correct category label to the f ixed training\nstimuli. Sawusch and Gagnon (1995) have suggested that\nlabels associated with representations of training stimuli\nmay allow the subject to generate an internal referent for\neach of the two categories, with which the current input\ncan be compared for purposes of identification. This idea\ncan provide the basis for a unified account of the identifi-\ncation results as well, in that one might suggest that the ef-\nfect of exaggeration is to increase the likelihood that the\nsubject will be able to generate consistentlabelseven in the\nabsence of feedback. We have not elaborated upon either\nof these accounts,since we are not specifically advocating\neither one, and we emphasize that these ideas are farfrom\nexhaustiveand may not be mutually exclusive.We present\nthem primarily as examples indicating that there may be\nmore than one way to account for the findings we have\nreported.\nThree days of training without feedback did not appear\nto produce transfer of training between the continua used\nin ourexperiments,but evidenceof transfer began to emerge\nafter 6 days of adaptive training. Furthermore, training\nwith feedback produced clear evidence of transfer, even\nafter 3 days. In the fixed trainingconditionwith feedback,\nthere was clearevidencethat transfer occurred in both iden-\ntification and discrimination. This evidence of transfer is\nimportantin ruling out the possibilitythat what the subjects\nlearned was merely some idiosyncraticproperty of the par-\nticular stimuli used in training. We emphasize, how ever,\nthat our findings cannot be taken as evidencethat what our\nsubjects have learned is a very general phonological dis-\ncrimination that would apply to all instances of [r] and [l]\nspoken in all contexts by all speakers. Previous investiga-\ntions (Bradlow et al., 1999; Bradlow et al., 1997; Lively\net al., 1993; Lively et al., 1994)do suggest that training can\nlead to broad generalization,but only if the training is cor-\nrespondingly broad. Morosan and Jamieson (1989) re-\nported generalizationof the benefits of training with syn-\nthetic stimuli on a word-initial [\nD]–[u] distinction to\nnatural tokens of word-initial [D]–[u ] contrasts produced\nby several speakers in a range of vowel contexts, but the\neffect of training did not generalize to medial or final posi-\ntions. It seems likely that the exact extent of generalization\nwill vary with the particular contrast used.\nWith these points in mind, we can considerthe question\nof whether our findings actuallyreflect the effects of train-\ning on the mechanisms that adult speakers ordinarily use\n106 M CCANDLISS, FIEZ, PROTOPAPAS, CONWAY, AND MCCLELLAND\nfor the processing of speech. The fact that the training\ntended to generalizefrom one continuumto anotheris con-\nsistent with this, and the fact that generalizationwas some-\nwhat less than perfect is not unexpected, given the previ-\nous findings just cited. One further point relevant to this\nissue is the observation that, at least with feedback, train-\ning appears to produce evidenceof categoricalperception,\na phenomenon that has sometimes been described as spe-\ncial to the mechanisms of spoken language processing\n(Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, & Studdert-Kenedy,\n1967). Evidence for categorical perception is providedby\nthe fact that when training was successful (i.e., in the\nadaptive/no-feedback condition and in both conditions\nwith feedback),the identificationfunctions became fairly\nsteep and sigmoidal in shape and by the fact that training\nproducedan increase in discriminationaroundthe crossover\npoint of the posttraining identification functions. How-\never, even with this evidence, it is possible to adopt an ap-\nproach like that advocatedbySawusch andGagnon (1995),\nin which perceptual category formation (as evidencedby a\nsteep identificationfunction, enhanced discriminationat a\ncategory boundary , and generalization)can arise with com-\nplexauditorystimulithat are not perceivedas speech.Thus,\nwe cannot rule out the possibility that the categories our\nsubjects learned were auditory , rather thanstrictly phono-\nlogical. Furthermore, even if they were phonological, it\nwould be difficult to know whether the effects of training\nreflected reorganization of the same perceptual mecha-\nnisms as those used in the perceptionof a native language\nor whether, instead, they reflected the recruitment of ad-\nditionalneural hardware that had not previouslybeen used\nfor speech discrimination but that exhibited properties\nsimilar to those exhibited by the established speech per-\nception machinery. Functional brain imaging studies of\nsecond-language learners may provide some evidence\nbearing on these issues, and some of the members of our\ngroup are pursuing such investigations.\nThere is at least one way in which the perceptual cate-\ngories acquired by our Japanese subjects differed from the\n[r]–[l] categories of native English speakers. The Japan-\nese subjects placed the boundary between their two cate-\ngories farther toward the [r] end of the continuum than did\nour native English speakingsubjects; in other words, they\ntended to place intermediate stimuli in the same category\nwith English [l], rather than English [r]. One interpreta-\ntion of these findings arises in the context of evidence in\nother studiesthat English [r] and [l] may not be equidistant\nfrom the closest Japanese phoneme (an apical-alveolar\ntap; Guion et al., 2000). Some findings (Guion et al.,\n2000, Experiment 2; Takagi, 1993; but see Guion et al.,\n2000, Experiment 1) suggest that the Japanese sound may\nbe more similar to English [l] than it is to English [r]. In\nthis context, one possibility is that our subjects learned a\nnew category for English [r], while continuing to hear\nmembers of the English [l] category as exemplars of their\nexistingJapanese category. The fact that the boundary was\nshifted toward the [r] end of the continuum, even though\nthe training stimuli were symmetrically placed around the\nEnglish crossoverpoint,would be consistentwith the pos-\nsibility that their preexisting category continued to exert a\nrelatively strong attractor or magnet-like effect, assimilat-\ning some of the intermediate stimuli. Only stimuli with\nstrong [r]-like content could escape the attractor and be\nreliably heard as members of the newly emerging percep-\ntual category .\nThe substantial learning in just three 20-min sessions\nseen in three of our trainingconditionsunderscoresthe point\nthat adult language learners maintain considerable plas-\nticity in their ability to learn perceptual speech contrasts.\nThis rapid learning contrasts with the very slow improve-\nment shown by adult Japanese second-language learners\nreceiving the [r] and [l] stimuli in spoken English (Flege\net al., 1996). There are two obvious factors that may con-\ntribute to the difference between our experimental condi-\ntions and naturalistic situations. First, in some of our con-\nditions, we made use of highlyexaggeratedcontrasts, and\neven the natural tokens used to construct our stimulus con-\ntinua may have been somewhat exaggerated or, at least,\nvery clear, as compared with natural tokens encountered\nin dailyexperiencewith running speech.Althoughmothers\ndo exaggerate speech to infants in ways that might facili-\ntate the initial establishment of phonetic categories (Kuhl\net al., 1997), it seems unlikely that exaggeration is regu-\nlarly provided in naturalistic speech to adults. Second, in\nsome of our conditions,we provided feedback,and it is un-\nlikely that feedback is often available in naturalistic con-\nditions. Indeed, in training without either exaggerationor\nfeedback, we find little or no sign of learning over the first\nthree training sessions. These two factors alone may be\nenough to account for the difficulty that second-language\nlearners face in acquiring the [r]–[l] contrast under natu-\nralistic conditions. However, there isanother characteris-\ntic of our experiment that may have contributed to the\nrapid learning that we observed in most of the conditions\nand even to the eventualemergence of a slight learning ef-\nfect in the fixed/no-feedback condition.This characteristic\nis the use of a single contrasting stimulus pair, such asrock\nand lock, spoken by a single individual. In our modeling\nwork (McClelland et al., 1999), we have found that when\nwe exposeournetworks to a single pair of stimuli,their rep-\nresentations eventually separate, even if initially they are\nhighlyoverlapping.This separation does not occur for such\npairs if the set of trainingstimuli includesseveral additional\nstimuli. This difference in the response of the model in\nthese two situationsreflectsthe fact that the competingstim-\nuli divide up the units available for representing speech\nsounds into clusters. When there are many stimuli compet-\ning for units, stimuli that are highly overlappingare forced\ninto the same cluster, but when there are only two stimuli,\nthey will eventuallydivide up the space between them even\nif they are highly overlapping. Slight differences in their\nrepresentationseventuallybecome amplified,leadingto the\ngradual emergence of distinct representations.\nThe focusing of experience on a single contrastingstim-\nulus pair may also be part of the explanation for the differ-\nences between our findings and those of Lively et al.\nTEACHING JAPANESE ADULTS THE [r]–[l] CONTRAST 107\n(1993; Lively et al., 1994)and Bradlow et al.(1999; Brad-\nlow et al., 1997). These studies used fixed stimuli with\nfeedback—conditions that led to very rapid learning in\nour experiment— but they employed a large number of\ndifferent minimal pairs all mixed togetherin their training\nset. Although their approach did lead to robust general-\nization,it also led to learning that was rather slow and still\nincomplete even after 45 h of training. The contrast be-\ntween our findings and theirs raises two possibilities that\nmay be worth examiningin future investigations.The first\nis that the diversity of the [r]–[l] contrast, as it is exhibited\nin different contextsand with different speakers, may con-\ntribute to the difficulty second-language learners have in\nacquiring this contrast from natural experience. The sec-\nond is that focusing training on a single contrast and/or a\nsingle speaker at a time may lead to faster and/or asymp-\ntoticallybetter learning.Some initialsuccess has been ob-\ntained with such an approach (Protopapas & Calhoun, in\npress; cf. Pruitt, 1995), but the matter deserves additional\ninvestigation.\nREFERENCES\nBarto, A. G.(1994). Reinforcement learning control. Current Opinion\nin Neurobiology, 4, 888-893.\nBest, C. [T.](1995).

Slope estimates were constrained to values less than or equal to 4.0\nbecause the slope estimation procedure is oversensitive at the high end.\n2. Note that in all statistical tests involving the control group, results\nhave been collapsed over the two continua, since the distinction between\ntrained and transfer is meaningless in this case.\n3. For this analysis, it was necessary to estimate the Day 3 perfor-\nmance of 2 subjects in the fixed/no-feedback condition, since their data\nwere lost owing to a recording error. The estimated data were constrained\nto preserve the mean and standard deviation of the Day 3 data exhibited\nby the rest of the fixed/no-feedback subjects.\n(Manuscript received August 30, 2001;\nrevision accepted for publication April 9, 2002.)"
