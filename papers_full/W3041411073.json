Interestingly, in crustaceans, many biological or economic traits exist that\nare signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between males and females, such as growth rate and body size (Sagi\net al., 1986; Browdy, 1998; Yu et al., 2017). Therefore, having an all-male or all-female culture of\naquatic animals plays an important role in increasing yield and improving quality based on sexual\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\nfphys-11-00631 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:33 # 2\nCai et al. Tra2 Regulates Sexual Dimorphic Expression\ncontrol technology. For instance, all-male Macrobrachium\nrosenbergii can be generated successfully through manipulation\nof the insulin-like androgenic gland (Sagi et al., 1990; Lezer et al.,\n2015), which would enable the total worldwide farmed volume to\nreach more than 200,000 tons. However, studies on the regulatory\nmechanism of sex determination in crustaceans are still limited\nat present, which impedes the development of sex-controlled\nbreeding techniques.\nThe molecular mechanism of sex determination and\ndiﬀerentiation in crustaceans is highly complex and currently\nremains poorly understood, which is likely due to the rapid\nevolution of genes involved in this process (Zhang and Qiu,\n2010). To date, many sex-related genes in crustaceans have been\nreported. For example, a body of evidence demonstrates that the\ninsulin-like androgenic gland hormone gene ( IAG) is the key\nfactor that drives male sexual diﬀerentiation in crustacean species\n(Sagi et al., 1990; Shi et al., 2019). In addition, the expression\nof Dmrt genes is aﬀected by silencing the IAG gene, suggesting\na possible role in the sex-diﬀerentiation processes (Amterat\nAbu Abayed et al., 2019). Several female sexual diﬀerentiation\ngenes, foxl2, fem1, and cfsh, have also been investigated in\ndiﬀerent crustacean species (Ma et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2018;\nJiang et al., 2020).\nThe redclaw crayﬁsh, Cherax quadricarinatus,is native to the\ntropical regions of northern Australia and southern New Guinea\n(Ventura et al., 2018). After being introduced into China in\nthe 1990s, it was favored by domestic breeding enterprises and\nconsumers. Like other crustaceans, the redclaw crayﬁsh exhibited\nsexual dimorphism in growth traits, with males growing faster\nand bigger than females at harvest (Zheng et al., 2019). In\naddition, the female redclaw crayﬁsh holds fewer eggs than\nother shrimps, which is one of the major factors aﬀecting\nthe development of the industry. The above status indicates\nthat developing monosex breeding for producing all-female or\nmale oﬀspring can meet the requirements of actual production.\nTherefore, a better understanding of the sex determination and\ndiﬀerentiation mechanisms of C. quadricarinatusto achieve sex-\ncontrolled breeding is urgently required.\nGenetic studies have shown that crustaceans are evolutionarily\nclosely related to insects in evolution (Budd and Telford, 2009),\nand the “ Sxl-tra/tra2-dsx” cascade signaling pathway has been\nshown to play an important role in sex development inDrosophila\nmelanogaster (Inoue et al., 1990; Penalva and Sanchez, 2003).\nTo date, Tra-2 gene has been cloned and analyzed in several\ncrustacean species, including Penaeus monodon (Leelatanawit\net al., 2009), Fenneropenaeus chinensis(Li et al., 2012), Daphnia\npulex (Chen et al., 2014), Eriocheir sinensis (Luo et al., 2017),\nand Macrobrachium nipponense (Wang et al., 2019). Although\nthe nucleotide sequences of Tra2 genes are similar to that\nof D. melanogaster , their alternative splicing patterns and\nexpression speciﬁcity are quite diﬀerent. These studies suggest\nthat crustaceans regulate the sex diﬀerentiation mechanism\ndiﬀerently than insects, which is dependent on alternative\nsplicing of pre-mRNA in a series of genes involved in the sex\ndetermination pathway.\nIn the present study, three mature tra2 mRNA splice variants\nwere identiﬁed from C. quadricarinatus, which were designated\nas CqTra-2A, CqTra-2B, and CqTra-2C. The nucleotide and\namino acid characterization of the three tra2 homologs are\nreported. Their expression distribution in various tissues and at\nvarious embryonic stages and diﬀerent juvenile developmental\nperiods were analyzed. Moreover, the eﬀect of CqTra2 gene\nsilencing via RNA interference (RNAi) on the expression ofCqdsx\nwas investigated. These results will be helpful for understanding\nthe progress of the sex regulation mechanisms of crustaceans.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAnimals and Samples Collection\nThe redclaw crayﬁsh used in this experiment were taken from the\nBalilidian breeding base of the Zhejiang Institute of Freshwater\nFisheries (Huzhou, Zhejiang Province). The average body weight\nand body length were 60 ±0.5 g and 14.5 ±0.2 cm, respectively.\nTissues, including the heart (Hea), hepatopancreas (Hep), ovary\n(Ov), testis (Te), muscle (Mu), intestine (In), and gill (Gi),\nwere dissected from three males and three females. Embryos\nat diﬀerent developmental stages, including fertilized eggs (I),\ncleavage and blastula (II), gastrula (III), nauplius (IV), eye\npigments forming (V), and prehatching (VI), were collected from\ngravid crayﬁsh. Description of the embryonic development of\nC. quadricarinatus was based on a previously published method\n(Meng et al., 2001). Juveniles that cultured in the pool of a\ngreenhouse were collected at diﬀerent body length stages. All\nthe samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and\ntransferred to −80◦C for nucleic acid extraction.\nRNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis\nTotal RNA were extracted from various tissues and embryonic\nsamples using Trizol Reagent (KangWei, Beijing) according to\nthe manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA quality was detected by\nelectrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, and the concentration\nwas measured by NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientiﬁc,\nUnited States). The isolated RNA was treated with RNase-\nfree DNase I (Promega, United States). Approximately 1 µg\nRNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the HiFiScript cDNA\nFirst-strand Synthesis Kit (KangWei, Beijing).\nFull-Length cDNA Identiﬁcation and\nPartial Genomic DNA Ampliﬁcation\nGenes encoding putative Tra2 proteins were screened from the\ntranscriptomes of C. quadricarinatus gonadal tissues that were\nconstructed in our lab (not published) by using F. chinensis\nTra2 sequences (accessions: JQ239126, JQ239127, and JQ239128)\nas a query. Three sequences were found to be similar to\nmembers of the tra2 homolog in F. chinensis. Additionally,\nthree pairs of gene-speciﬁc primers were designed to obtain the\nfull-length transcripts of three Cqtra2 homologs. PCRs using\nthe cDNA template from the ovary were performed under the\nfollowing conditions: one cycle of 95 ◦C for 5 min; 32 cycles\nincluding denaturation at 95 ◦C for 30 s, annealing at 56 ◦C for\n30 s, and extension at 72 ◦C for 90 s; one cycle of 72 ◦C for\n7 min.

The\nspeciﬁc primers were designed for three mature tra-2 isoforms\n(Table 1). qRT-PCR was performed on a LightCycler\nR⃝480 system\n(Roche, Switzerland) in a 10- µL reaction mix containing 1 µL\nof cDNA template, 0.5 µL of each primer (10 µM), 3 µL\nof water, and 5 µL of SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM (TaKaRa,\nChina). 18S-rRNA was used as the reference gene, and each\ntest was performed in triplicate. The melting curves were\nanalyzed after ampliﬁcation to identify the speciﬁc product\nin all PCRs. The threshold cycle (Ct) values via the 2 −11Ct\nmethod were calculated using the qRT software provided for\nthe LightCycler\nR⃝ 480 System (Tan et al., 2017). A histogram for\nfold comparison of diﬀerent samples was generated by inputting\nthe 2−11Ct values of diﬀerent samples into the GraphPad Prism\n5 program software (Roche, Switzerland). Statistical analyses\nwere performed by SPSS 19.0, and signiﬁcant diﬀerences were\ndetermined using a Pearson test.\nKnock-Down of Cqtra2 by\ndsRNA-Mediated RNA Interference\nFragments of CqTra-2 (350 bp) and EGFP (359 bp) containing\nT7 promoter were synthesized by the GenScript company and\nsubcloned into the vector pUC57.

As\nshown in Figure 1B, CqTra-2A contained exon A and exon C,\nand CqTra-2B contained exon A and exon B, while the three\nexons were absent from CqTra-2C.\nMultiple Alignment and Phylogenetic\nAnalysis\nThe multiple alignment of amino acid sequences by BLAST\nshowed that the identity of all homologs of CqTra2 was very high,\nand domain prediction using the online software GOR4 revealed\nthat they all possessed a highly conserved RNA recognition motif\n(RRM) that was shared with other Tra2 proteins ( Figure 2A ).\nBased on the clustalW algorithm alignment of 21 Tra-2 members\n(Table 2), the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-\njoining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA 5\nsoftware. The phylogenetic tree showed that the Tra2 protein\nwas highly conserved among shrimp and crab species, including\nC. quadricarinatus, M. rosenbergii, F. chinensis, E. sinensis, and\nM. nipponense. Curiously, D. pulex, part of the scientiﬁc class\nCrustacea, was classiﬁed into a single clade with Tra-2 sequences\nfrom Aedes aegyptithat belonged to insects (Figure 2B).\nTissue-Speciﬁc Distribution of Three\nCqTra2 Transcripts in Adult Crayﬁsh\nA quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to detect the\nexpression level of three diﬀerent splice variants of CqTra-2 in\nadult tissues. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that the three\nsplice isoforms were all highly expressed in the ovary and weakly\nexpressed in the testis, while low expression was observed in other\ntissues, including the hepatopancreas, muscle, gill, intestine, and\nheart (Figure 3). In the gonads, expression proﬁling of CqTra-2B\nand CqTra-2C showed sex diﬀerences with a higher expression\nlevel in the ovary than in the testis ( P < 0.05), but CqTra-2A\nmRNA abundance was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between female\nand male gonads ( P > 0.05). Additionally, CqTra-2 expression\ndid not signiﬁcantly diﬀer between adult male and female tissues\nof C. quadricarinatus.\nExpression Pattern in Different\nDevelopmental Stages of Embryos and\nJuveniles\nTo investigate the temporal expression pattern of the CqTra2\ngene during embryogenesis and juvenile development, we\nmeasured the relative expression level at various stages using\nRT-PCR. All CqTra2 transcripts were detected at a low\nlevel in fertilized eggs, at a high level in the cleavage and\nblastula stage, and at a peak in the prehatching stage. The\nmRNA expression level of CqTra-2B was obviously higher\nthan CqTra-2A and CqTra-2C at each stage of embryonic\ndevelopment ( Figure 4 ). Determining the initial stages of sex\ndiﬀerentiation is crucial to study sexual regulation mechanisms.\nThe expression levels of CqTra-2 at diﬀerent developmental\nstages of juveniles were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results\nshowed that the CqTra-2 expression level exhibited a peak\nwhen the body length of juveniles reached 3 cm ( Figure 5 ).\nInterestingly, CqTra-2B/C mRNA abundances were signiﬁcantly\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\nfphys-11-00631 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:33 # 7\nCai et al.

DNA\nfragments of CqTra2 and EGFP containing the T7 promoter\nwere directly synthesized and cloned into the vector for dsRNA\ntranscription in vitro. An RNAi assay was performed through\ninjection of CqTra2- and EGFP-dsRNA into the cephalothoraxes\nof the juveniles. The results showed that the transcription\nlevels of CqTra2 with the speciﬁc primers CqTra2-RT-F and\nCqTra2-RT-R by qRT-PCR was decreased by approximately 85%,\nindicating that dsRNA-mediated gene silencing was successful. In\ncrustaceans, doublesex and its homologous genes were important\nregulators of sexual diﬀerentiation. Here, we also observed\na signiﬁcant decrease in Cqdsx after knockdown of CqTra-2\n(Figure 6 ). Thus, it was determined that CqTra2 might be the\nupstream regulator of Cqdsx.\nDISCUSSION\nSexual dimorphism is a common phenomenon in decapod\naquaculture species (Sagi and Aﬂalo, 2005; Shi et al., 2019).\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms of sexual regulation\nin these species is attractive because a monosex culture can oﬀer\ngreat beneﬁts (Sagi et al., 1997; Ventura et al., 2012; Levy et al.,\n2016). Recently, with the development of sequencing technology,\nthe transcriptome and genome data of some crustacean species\nare also being explored by researchers. Although many sex-\nrelated genes have been reported, understanding of the genetic\nmechanisms involved in sexual regulation in crustaceans\nis still limited.\nIn this study, the full-length cDNA sequences of three CqTra-\n2 isoforms were obtained from the transcriptome library of\ngonadal tissues of C. quadricarinatus, which is a homolog\nof the sex diﬀerentiation protein Tra and is involved in\nthe sex determination pathway in D. melanogaster (Inoue\net al., 1990; Penalva and Sanchez, 2003; Sarno et al., 2010).\nEvidence has shown that alternative splicing plays a role\nin the tissue development and physiology of animals (Chen\nand Manley, 2009). Analysis of the partial gene organization\nstructure of C. quadricarinatus showed that CqTra-2 isoforms\noriginated from the same genomic locus and were generated\nby alternative splicing of the same pre-mRNA. The Tra2 gene\nhas diﬀerent splice variants in many arthropod species, such\nas D. melanogaster (Amrein et al., 1990), Bombyx mori (Niu\net al., 2005), F. chinensis (Li et al., 2012), and E. sinensis (Luo\net al., 2017). As shown in Figure 2A , the deduced amino acid\nsequences of CqTra-2A, CqTra-2B, and CqTra-2C contained\na conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), implying that the\nRRM domain in the CqTra-2 homolog might provide a structural\nbasis for its potential function as a splicing factor (Luo et al.,\n2017). Our phylogenetic tree revealed that CqTra2 clustered\nwith F. chinensis, M. rosenbergii, and M. nipponense CqTra2\nand separated from two other crustaceans, E. sinensis and\nP. monodon. This means that the CqTra2 protein was much closer\nto the Tra2 protein in F. chinensis and diverged from that in\nanother decapod, P. monodon, during evolution.\nTo explore the biological function of CqTra-2 in the redclaw\ncrayﬁsh, the gene expression proﬁles of the CqTra-2 splice\nvariants were analyzed. First, the tissue distribution revealed\nthat CqTra-2 displayed a sexually dimorphic expression pattern\nacross gonadal tissues. Unlike other species, the CqTra-2 mRNA\nabundance in non-gonadal tissues of C. quadricarinatus was\nextremely low, suggesting that the primary function of CqTra-2\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\nfphys-11-00631 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:33 # 8\nCai et al.

It should also be\nnoted that the three CqTra-2 transcripts had a higher expression\nlevel in the ovary than in the testis, which was consistent with\nthe expression proﬁle of Tra-2 in F. chinensis (Li et al., 2012).\nMoreover, CqTra-2 gene expression was detected from fertilized\nFIGURE 6 | Effects of CqTra2-dsRNA injection on gene expression levels in\ncephalothoraxes of C. quadricarinatus.

The zygote genome starts from\nthe tenth cell division in zebraﬁsh (Francisco, 2003), and we\ninferred that CqTra-2 might be a maternal gene based on its\nmRNA expression characteristics.\nTo date, the sex determination mechanisms in crustacean\nspecies are unknown. RNAi is commonly used as a tool to\ninvestigate the function of target genes in many species (Hasuwa\net al., 2002). Here, we employed RNAi-induced gene silencing to\nfurther explore the role of the CqTra-2 gene in sexual regulation\nof C. quadricarinatus. After injection with CqTra2 dsRNA, the\nexpression level of Cqdsx gene was downregulated. A previous\nstudy in F. chinensis indicated that the FcDsx gene might be\ninvolved in the shrimp sexual diﬀerentiation process (Li et al.,\n2018). Hence, together with the expression analysis and the\ninhibition expression of the CqTra2 gene, we inferred that\nCqTra2 played an important role in sex diﬀerentiation. Certainly,\nfurther studies are needed to determine: (1) the role of CqTra-\n2 in sex reversal or gonadal histology after RNAi treatment;\n(2) the interplay between CqTra2 and Cqdsx in the regulation\nmechanism of sex diﬀerentiation.\nIn conclusion, we isolated and characterized three\nalternatively spliced isoforms of CqTra-2 gene in\nC. quadricarinatus for the ﬁrst time. Subsequently, the primary\nfunctions of CqTra-2 were investigated using qRT-PCR and\nRNAi. The present data provide insights into the possible\nfunction of CqTra-2 gene in female sex diﬀerentiation in\nC. quadricarinatus . RNAi assay revealed that CqTra2 can\nregulate the expression of Cqdsx, indicating that CqTra2 might\nbe the upstream regulator of Cqdsx. Our results will help us to\nbetter study the sex determination mechanism in crustaceans.\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\nfphys-11-00631 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:33 # 9\nCai et al.
