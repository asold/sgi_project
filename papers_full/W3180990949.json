INTRODUCTION \nThe energy sector deals with electricity accounting for \naccurate settlements and monitoring the dynamic events for \npower quality assurance. The measuring instruments for phasor \nmeasurement [1], current conversion [2], [3] including current \ntransformers (CT), are used all over the world. The accuracy of \nmeasuring inst ruments is steadily increasing and researchers \ncontinue to find the approaches for minim ising the errors of \nequipment, in particular those of instrument transformers [4]. \nCTs have often an accuracy class of 0.2S or 0.5S according to \nthe IEC standard and contribute to the accuracy of electricity \naccounting [5]. Almost all Countries have calibration laboratories \nthat perform CT calibration, but not every laboratory is capable \nof calibrating a precision transformer with a measurement \nuncertainty of 50 μA/A, and less. For example, Europe's leading \nPTB (Germany) laboratory declared measurement uncertainty in \non-site calibrating the isolating CTs slightly less than 40 µA/A \n[6]. A sampling current ratio bridge for the calibration of CTs \nwas developed at VSL (Netherlands) laboratory. The expanded \nuncertainty, declared by the developer, does not exceed 5 µA/A \nin magnitude and 5 µrad in phase [7]. The researchers have also \noffered alternative approaches to determining the metrological \ncharacteristics of instrument transformers, such as the \napplication of a quasi -balance technique usin g the virtual \ninstrument [8], or low cost efficient digit iser [9], or a me thod \nbased on the low -voltage reciprocity principle  [10], or a \ncalculation of the errors based on the excitation table [11]. \n2. OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE \nA traditional technique of comparison with the reference CT \nusing means of comparing remains predominant in the practice \nof most laboratories. The means of comparing the currents of \nboth a working standard and a device under test (DUT) is an \nimportant component of the CT calibration system. The \ncontributions of such devices used by National Metrology \nInstitutes can be observed in the uncertainty budgets presented \nin the final Supplementary Comparison reports. In particular, the \nmeasurement uncertainties of means of comparing associated \nwith PTB and FGUP \"UNIIM\" (Russia) are approximately 0.5 \nABSTRACT \nThe manuscript presents a method for the metrological characteri sation of the commercial AC comparators used to calibrate current \ntransformers. The theoretical basis for simulating the difference between two almost identical currents has been outlined, as  well as \nthe mathematical m odels for both a ratio error and a phase displacement has been derived. The measurement setup, consisting of \nconventional measuring instruments, has been described with a detailed presentation of its parameters. The sources of uncerta inty \nhave been disting uished and analy sed with determining the current phase shift which led to a significant increase of relative \nmeasurement uncertainty. The simulation of measurement results was yielded in two ways: physically using a method presented a nd \nvirtually using a M onte Carlo method. The second method confirmed that evaluating the measurement uncertainty through derived \nsensitivity coefficients is correct enough. The simulation results in the range from 1 to 1200 parts per million for both rat io error and \nphase displ acement motivated the use of a comparator characteri sed through the proposed method for accurate measurement, \nespecially for very low errors. \n \nACTA IMEKO | www.imeko.org June 2021 | Volume 10 | Number 2 | 7 \npart per million (ppm) [12]. The lowest contribution of the PTB’s \nbridge has a level of several hundredths of µA/A [13]. However, \nsuch a level of measurement uncertainty is reached only by some \nNational Metrology Institutes, providing special conditions for \ncalibration. The measurement uncertainty associated with the \ncalibration of the current transformer bridge of GUM (Poland) \nis 5 µA/A in ratio error (RE) and 14.5 µrad in phase displacement \n(PD) [14].  \nSE \"Ukrmetrteststandard\", as a conformity assessment body, \ndeals with both calibration and certification of measuring \ninstruments, in particular CTs. Based on the available \ninformation, it can be argued that in today’s calibration activities, \nCT manufacturers, testing labs, ener gy companies, and other \nrelated enterprises remain using commercially available means of \ncomparing. When calibrating CTs with an accuracy class of 0.2S, \nthe contribution to the total measurement uncertainty, obtained \nvia the admissible tolerance, from the use of the measuring \nbridge can be more than 90  % of the contribution of all the \ninfluencing variables when determining the RE value of \n480 µA/A [15]. \nThe design features and factors that affect the accuracy of one \nof the commercial automatic test devices are described in a \ndeveloper article. In particular, it is stated that the accuracy of \nsuch a measuring instrument should not exceed 1 percent of the \nmeasurement resu lt [16]. According to the user's guide of the \nCA507 comparator produced in Ukraine, the minimum intrinsic \nuncertainty is 2 µA/A when measuring RE. The analogous figure \nfor PD measurement is 8.73 µrad.  \nThe system for calibrating an automatic transformer test set \nusing a current source with an operational amplifier was \ndeveloped at the CMI (Czech Republic)  [17]. T he method, \ndeveloped in TUBITAK UME (Turkey), intended for \ndetermining the errors of the CT test sets allows characteri sing \nthese tools with a total uncertainty of 10 ppm [18]. \nThe c reation of a convenient method for accurate \nmetrological characteri sation of comparison means for two \nalmost identical alternating currents is the main task of the \nresearch work. Evaluating the uncertainty of measurements \nduring its calibration using a derived mathematical model is also \nan objective of the paper.  \nTo characterise the contribution of the work and to determine \nthe place in the body of the instrumentation and measurement it \nshould be noted that the mathematical models for determining \nthe reference values of RE and PD allow check ing the accuracy \nof CT calibrati on unit (i.e., comparator of two approximately \nequal currents) in an alternative way using the suitable \nmeasurement setup. According to the obtained models, it is easy \nto calculate the contribution of each input quantity and to \nevaluate an expanded uncertainty both in determining RE and in \ndetermining PD. \n3. THEORETICAL BASIS \n3.1. Definition of current transformer errors \nAccording to world practice, it is customary to express the \nimperfection of a scale conversion of the CT using two \ncharacteristics: the current RE and the PD [19].  \nThe current RE (εI) following the IEC standard is the ratio of \nthe product of the І2 secondary current amplitude and the КТ \ntransformation ratio of CT to the amplitude of the І1 primary \ncurrent, i.e.: \n( )2 1 1ε =100IT K I I I  −\n. (1) \nWhen the current flows successively through the primary \nwindings of the DUT and reference transformer in th e primary \nmeasuring circuit during calibration, one can consider the \nequation \n( ) 1100=X S T X S K I I Iεε −   −\n, (2) \nwhere IX and IS are the secondary currents of DUT and \nworking standard, respectively. \nSince the error is usually obtained as a subtraction of the \nreference reading from the DUT reading and divided by the \nreference reading, the primary current should be expressed \nthrough the secondary current of a reference transformer. In this \ncase, it is possible to express the RE of the DUT through the \nratio of se condary currents. To do this, one should obtain the \nexpression of primary current І1 from equation (1) for the \nworking standard: \n( )1 1 100T S SI K I ε=  +\n. (3) \nAssuming the current RE of the reference transformer is zero \n(the case of an ideal transformer) , one can transform the \nexpression (2) to \n( )100 1=X X S IIε −\n. (4) \nFor further analysis, it is more convenient to express the RE \nin relative units ( µA/A); therefore, factor 100 will be removed \nfrom the expression (4). \nThe PD (Δ φ) between the φ2 initial phase of the sinusoidal \nsecondary current and the φ1 initial phase of the primary current \nis the second component of the current scaling characteristic: \n12φ φ φ = −\n. (5) \nWhen the same current flows in the primary cir cuit of both \nthe DUT and the working standard connected in series, the initial \nphase is the same for both devices, i.e.:  \n112 2 2 2=+X S X X S S X Sφ φ φ φ φ φ φ φ − − − = −\n. (6) \nIf the PD of the reference transformer is zero (for an ideal \ntransformer) then the PD between the prim ary and secondary \nDUT currents will be defined as the phase shift of the DUT \nsecondary current relative to the secondary current of the \nreference transformer. \n3.2. Simulation of current difference \nThe comparator produced in Ukraine is structured in such a \nway that its design has a measuring circuit where the current \nphasor is formed. This phasor is a result of subtracting two \ncurrents, i.e. DUT current and working standard current. This \nmeasuring circuit converts the specified current phasor and the \noutput current phasor of the reference transformer into voltage \ndrop during its passing through the certain measuring shunt. \nFurthermore, the measurement information is converted into \ndigital codes by the analog-to-digital converter to calculate the \nratio of the current difference phasor to the phasor of the \nreference transformer current.  \nIn the typical operation of a comparator, there is a \ncomparison of two currents. The current difference between two \ncurrents Id flows through the certain input circuit and the current \nIS of the reference transformer flows through the other \nmeasuring circuit. The DUT current IX is absent inside the device \nand the comparator indicates the value of the RE and PD.  \nLet us consider the case where the DUT current exceed s the \namplitude of the reference transformer current, as shown in \nFigure 1. The angle β is the angle between the phasors of Id and \n \nACTA IMEKO | www.imeko.org June 2021 | Volume 10 | Number 2 | 8 \nIS currents. To determine the char acteristics of the interrelation \nbetween the DUT current and reference transformer current, it \nis necessary to determine the unknown elements of the triangle \nin Figure 1. The AC segment is determined as: \ncC= osA dI β\n. (7) \nThe BC segment is determined as:  \nsC= inB dI β\n. (8) \nThe magnitude of the IX phasor is present in expression (4). \nSince this secondary current is not present in the circuit during \nsimulation, its value must be expressed using expressions (7) and \n(8) through the equation: \n( ) ( )\n2\n22 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2\n22\n2\n2\n= AC BC sin\n+ + sin\ncos\ncos cos\n+cos\nX S S d d\nS S d d d\nS S d d\nI I I I I\nI I I I I\nI I I I\nββ\nβ β β\nβ\n+ + = +  + \n= +      =\n+   \n. (9) \nSubstituting the expression (9) into equation (4), the following \nexpression can be obtained to determine RE: \n221 2 1= cosX d S d S I I I Iεβ +   + −\n. (10) \nIt should be mentioned that when considering the variant of \nthe interrelation of Id and IS phasors, in case of excess in the \namplitude of the current IS, the sign before 2 changes to the \nopposite in expression (10). \nRegarding the PD, it is determined from the ratio of the sides \nof the triangle in Figure 1: \n( ) ( )tan =BC +ACXS Iφ\n. (11) \nThe use of an inverse trigonometric function can define the \nexpression for PD determination: \n( )=atan sin cosX d S d I I Iφ β β   +  \n. (12) \nWhen considering the variant of the interrelation of Id and IS \nphasors, in case of excess in the amplitude of the current IS, no \nchange occurs in expression (12). Since in this case, it is necessary \nto consider a right-angled triangle with a known angle of (π - β). \n4. REALISATION OF METHOD \n4.1. Measurement setup description \nThe suggested technique allows calibrating the CT calibration \nunit by using the measuring scheme presented in Figure 2. Let us \nconsider the elements of the measuring scheme for determining \nthe relative current difference. A precision CT (T) should be used \nas a stable AC current scaling element to calibrate the AC \ncomparator. The secondary current is estimated to be sma ller \nthan a percent (or one-tenth of a percent) of the primary current. \nIt means that CT secondary current simulates current difference \nId between DUT and reference transformer. To simulate the low \ncurrent difference, it may be necessary to introduce another \nstable CT for cascading into the measurement scheme in  Figure \n2. Thus, it is possible to achieve simulated error values of about \n1 µA/A, and even less. \nThe elements of the measuring circuit are connected in such \na way that Id creates a voltage drop at the left P4834 resistance \ndecade box as well as at the right measuring shunt of the CA507 \ncomparator. A precision AC voltmeter is used to estimate the Id \nvalue through Ohm's law: \n=d RDB RDBI U R\n, (13) \nwhere URBD is a voltage drop caused by current Id that flows \nthrough the left P4834 resistance decade box; RRBD is a true value \nof the left P4834 resistance decade box. \nTo account for the branching of the current between the left \nP4834 resistance decade box and the precision voltmeter input \ncircuit, the value of Id was also adjusted by the entry of the KIM \nbranching factor. \nThe current flowing in the reference transformer circuit can \nbe estimated using the CA507 built -in ammeter with worse \nuncertainty. If there is a need to decrease the total measurement \nuncertainty in the calibration of the AC comparator, a precision \nammeter can be connected in series or the output voltage of the \nFluke A40 precision shunt (R1) can be measured with a precision \nAC voltmeter. The contribution of using the CA507 comparator \nbuilt-in ammeter to the combined standard uncertainty will be \nestimated below.  \nThe CA507 right measuring shunt is an integral part of the \ncalibrated comparator design and is used for extracting \ninformation on the difference between two input currents. The \nCT primary current flows through the CA507 internal ammeter, \nand also creates a voltage drop at both R1 current shunt and \nCA507 left shunt. The last shunt is used in the comparator design \nfor extracting information on the current IS of the reference \ntransformer. \nA dual-channel Clarke-Hess 6000A phase meter is needed to \ndetermine the angle β between the currents flowing through the \nFluke A40 current shunt and the left P4834 resistance decade \nbox. Both the right P4834 res istance decade box and the P5025 \ncapacitance box are connected in parallel to shift the angle β. It \nshould be noted that the phase-shifting unit is only needed when \nsimulating the PD, and may be absent during the simulation of \nthe RE. Instead , it is possib le to find the relation between the \ncapacitance and the resistance of the phase -shifting unit when \nthe angle β is close to zero. \n \nFigure 1. Interrelation between currents. \n \nFigure 2. The electrical scheme of AC comparator calibration.  \n\n \nACTA IMEKO | www.imeko.org June 2021 | Volume 10 | Number 2 | 9 \n4.2.  Measurement setup characteristics \nAccording to the measurement scheme presented in Figure 2, \na selection of the appropriate parameters of the circuit elements \nallowed us to simulate the RE and PD in the range of values from \n1 ppm to 1200  ppm. Table 1 summarises the estimates of the \ninput quantities for which the RE values were obtained. It should \nbe mentioned that the measurement setup allows  us to vary the \ninput quantities over a wide range and simulate a large number \nof RE values. Besides, the smallest measurement uncertainty can \nbe achieved by setting the angle β close to 0 ° or 180º, and the \nworst uncertainty will be if the angle β will be 90º. Table 2 \npresents the estimates of the input quantities for which the PD \nvalues were obtained. \nThe measurement setup allows us also to change the input \nquantities similarly to simulate the PD values. In this case, the \nsmallest relative uncertainty of measurements can be achieved by \nsetting the angle β close to 90 or 270º, and the worst uncertainty \nwill be when the angle β will be 0 or 180º. \nThe measurement uncertainty, which the set of measuring \ninstruments used can provide, is also a characteristic parameter \nof the measurement setup. Models (10) and (12) describe the \ndependence of simulated REs and PDs on variables whose \nuncertainty affects the total uncertainty of measurements of \nsimulated quantities. Table 3 presents the simplified uncertainty \nbudget for the RE of 32 µA/A and shows that the contribution \nof each input quantity for a given RE simulation point is \ncomparable to each other. \nTable 4 presents a simplified uncertainty budget for the \nsimulated PD of 241 µrad and shows that the contribution of \neach input quantity for a given PD simulation point is \ncomparable to each other, as well as the previous case. \n5. ANALYSIS OF MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY \n5.1. General points \nAccording to GUM 1995 [20], to determine the sensitivity \ncoefficients of the input quantities, one must take the first partial \nderivatives for each input quantity. A  detailed description of \nobtaining the sensitivity coefficients of the input quantities for \nthe mathematical model (10) is given in the previous work [21]. \nAs for th e model (12), the expressions for determining the \nsensitivity coefficients are given in [22].  \nTo verify the correctness of the expressions obtained, the MS \nExcel software was used to calculate the sensitivity coefficients \nc(xi) as the ratio of the increase of the transformed mathematical \nmodels with a substitution of current Id according to expression \n(13) to the small increase of each variable separately by the \ngeneral expression: \n( ) ( )i i iс x f x x= \n, (14) \nwhere Δ f(xi) is a small increase of the corresponding \nmathematical model; Δxi is a small increase in the chosen input \nquantity. \nThe values obtained by the expression (14) were equal to the \nvalues calculated by the derived analytical expressions. \nOne of the factors in a distortion of the results of sinusoidal \ncurrent measurements is the shape of the curve. During the \nstudy, there were doubts about providing a sinusoidal curve in \nthe secondary winding of a current -scaling transformer T. That \nis because in simulating the tr ansformer errors, the secondary \nwinding of this transformer was loaded with resistance in the \nrange from 1 kΩ to 60 kΩ. To verify the curve of the sine wave \nat the terminals of the P4834 decade box, a voltage form was \nmonitored using an oscilloscope since the secondary current \nflowed through the resistance decade box. The observation result \nis presented in Figure 3 in a form of a photograph. \nIn Figure 3 it can be seen that the secondary current of the \ntransformer T (bottom left), which was more than 10 µA, flowed \nthrough the resistance decade box (top left). The comparator \ndisplay (top right) shows that the current in the transformer \nprimary winding was approximately 1  A. The resistance value \nwas 400 kΩ and the voltage at the terminals of the resistance \ndecade box was controlled by a digital oscilloscope (bottom \nTable 1.

The display of th e oscilloscope shows that the voltage \nform did not differ from the sine wave. \nThus, a load of several tens or hundreds of kΩ on the \nsecondary winding with a current of less than 0.1% of a rated \ncurrent did not distort the shape of the secondary current. There \nwas only an increase in the phase shift of the secondary current \nrelative to the primary and the change in the simulated \ncharacteristics.  \nIn a previous work, the P4834 decade box was characteri sed \nregarding the voltage phase shift at the terminals of this device \nrelative to the flowing current [23]. Both the dependence of the \nphase shift on the set resistance and the corresponding \nmeasurement uncertainty was determined. It was found that the \neffect of the phase shift relative to the measured value, especially \nfor the current phase shift of ab out 180º, was noticeable. This \nwas reflected in the fact that the ratio of expanded measurement \nuncertainty to the result of PD measurement increased markedly. \nIn contrast, with a phase shift between currents that differed \nfrom 180º by more than 10º no inc rease in relative uncertainty \nwas observed. \n5.2. Ratio error measurement uncertainty \nContinuing the analysis, one can distinguish certain \ncharacteristic points when the simulated errors acquire values for \nwhich the measurement uncertainty far exceeds the error itself. \nThis is due to the presence of a trigonometric component in both \nmathematical models. To find the characteristic points, the \ninterrelation between input quantities was selected in a such \nposition when the RE measurement result was 18 µA/A. A series \nof the RE values at fixed values of all input quantities except for \nthe current phase shift were modeled. The corresponding \nmeasurement uncertainty was also evaluated. The results of this \nsimulation are presented graphically in Figure 4. \nAccording to the model (10), Figure 4 shows that the RE (blue \ncurve) acquires minimum value when the current phase shift gets \nthe value of 90º. However, the absolute value of measurement \nuncertainty varies slightly over the whole range. The \ncorresponding relative uncertainty of the measurements (red \ncurve) in the current phase shift range from 0 ° to about 60º and \nfrom 120 ° to 180º remained at almost one level of about 2 \npercent despite the measured value in the simulation varied \nseveral dozen times. With a significant decrease in the simulated \nerror, the percentage ratio of the almost constant measurement \nuncertainty to the specified error increased significantly, going to \ninfinity at a point of 90º.  \n5.3. Phase displacement measurement uncertainty \nTo find the characteristic points in the PD simulation, the \ninterrelation between the input quantities was chosen in such a \nposition when the measurement result was 603 µrad. Several PD \nvalues were also simulated as well as the corresponding \nmeasurement uncertainty was estimated. The results of this \nsimulation are presented graphically in Figure 5. \nAccording to the model described by equation (12), Figure 5 \nshows that the PD (blue curve) acquired minimal value when a \ncurrent phase shift of 0 ° or 180º was achieved. However, the \nabsolute measurement uncertainty was almost the same since the \nmeasured quantities remained constant, only the pha se shift \nbetween currents changed. The intrinsic uncertainty of the phase \nmeter also remained almost constant, and the change of phase \nshift only affected the sensitivity coefficients. Since the \nmeasurand in the simulation varied 2-3 times in the current phase \n \nFigure 3. Observation of the shape of the voltage curve at the terminals of \nthe P4834 decade box. \n \nFigure 4.

Nevertheless, with a \nsignificant decrease in the simulated error, the percentage ratio \nof the almost constant measurement uncertainty to the specified \nerror increased significantly, going to infinity at points of 0 and \n180º. The phenomena analy sed above can be illustrated in a \nvector form as shown in Figure 6. \nOption a) of Figure 6 shows that at a current phase shift close \nto 90° or -90º when the small value of the difference between the \nІХ and ІS currents occurs, the whole error accounts for the PD \n(the amplitude of the ІХ and ІS currents will be the same). Instead, \noption b) illustrates the opposite case where PD is absent and \nthe whole current difference is related to the RE. Such points \noccur when the current phase shift is 0° or 180º. \n6. SIMULATING MEASUREMENT RESULTS \n6.1. Simulation using method proposed \nIn Table 5 and Table 6, the results of simulating the errors of \nCT, using the scheme depicted in Figure 2, are presented. \nAccording to the specification of the CA507 comparator, the \nintrinsic uncertainty when measuring RE is determined in \npercentage by the formula \n( )0.005 0.0002 0.0001REu =  + + \n. (15)  \nAs can be seen from expression (15), the minimum \nuncertainty value cannot be less than 2 µA/A.  \nAccording to the specification of the CA507 comparator, the \nintrinsic uncertainty in PD measurement is determined in \nminutes by the formula  \n( )0.005 0.03 0.7 15PDu =  + + \n. (16)  \nAs can be seen in expression (16), the minimum uncertainty \nvalue cannot be less than 8.73 µrad. In Table 6, the intrinsic \nuncertainty of CA507 is evaluated as 21.2 when measuring \n605 µrad, and it exceeds the uncertainty when measuring \n1132 µrad. One can see a clear upward trend in this characteristic \nwith increasing measured value in formula (16). However, the \ninterrelation between the RE and PD at the simulated \nmeasurement point led to an increase in intrinsic uncertainty due \nto the sufficiently strong effect of the amplitude component \nportion [24]. \nFigure 7 shows that the measurement uncertainty, evaluated \naccording to GUM 1995 [20] for measured REs less than \n100 µA/A, has a large margin regarding test uncertainty ratio. \nHowever, for the error above 200  µA/A, measurement \nuncertainty increases markedly under conditions without \nadditional measures such as stabil isation of the supply of the \nmeasuring circuit, determination of the voltmeter input \nimpedance, etc.  \nIn Figure 7, it could also be seen that the difference between \nthe comparator readout and the reference value increases with \nthe increase of the simulated error value. \n6.2. Simulation using Monte Carlo method \nTo verify the correctness of the measurement uncertainty \nevaluation for the method proposed we decided to apply the \nMonte Carlo method during the simulation of the measurement \nresults. The simulation was performed within the uncertainty of \neach input quantity (a case for RE of 32 ppm is presented in  \nTable 3, and for PD of 241 ppm in Table 4). The simulation was \nyielded using the  MS Excel software by generating the values \nwith RANDBETWEEN function within the specified \nuncertainty intervals of the input quantities of both the model \n(10) for RE and the model (12) for PD, the number of error value \nobservations was set to 30, and the number of the values \ngenerated was set to 10. The values of the simulation results, \nwhich differed as much as possible from values reported in Table \n5 and Table 6, are given in Table 7 for RE and in Table 8 for PD, \nas well as the average deviation. \nCompared with the data obtained using the method \nproposed, the results obtained by the Monte Carlo method have \na maximum deviation which did not exceed th e uncertainty \nlimitations specified above in Table 5 for RE and in Table 6 for \nPD. No simulated RE and PD values were obtained that  would \nexceed the limits of the measurement uncertainty evaluated. \nTable 5.

DISCUSSION \nOne of the tasks of the calibration laboratory is to provide \nmeasurement uncertainty in the reference values 4 times less than \nthat provided by the DUT. This paper proposes a method that \nallows achieving a measurement uncertainty of several tent hs of \nµA/A when calibrating a commercial CT calibration unit under \nordinary laboratory conditions. \nThe calibration procedure described in the paper [25] involves \nreaching the condition when the error current is in phase with \nthe standard current when determining the RE. To determine the \nPD, the shift of the error current by 90 degrees relative to the \ncurrent through the standard current measurement circuit must \nbe achieved. It should be noted that the proposed method allows \ncharacterising the commercial AC comparators without the \nrequirement of in -phase currents or a 90° angle shift due to \napplying the precision phase meter as stated in Section 4.1. As \ndescribed in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, the proposed procedure can be \napplied for determining the errors of AC comparators in a wide \nrange of changes in the current phase shift. \nIn the method described in [26] and [18], which has been \nmentioned in Section  2, an increment of simulated errors is \nlimited to the discreteness of the PC -controlled three -phase \npower source, and a step of changing the ratio of turns of the \nelectronically-compensated current comparator corresponds to \n0.5 %. The use of a phase-shifting unit allowed the simulation of \nCT errors of almost any value using the method proposed. Due \nto the use of laboratory CT as a source, it is possible to generate \nthe stable values of simulated errors, and cascading two such CTs \nallow us to simulate very small errors. \nIn Table 5 and Table 6 of Section  6.1, one can see that \nachieving the measurement uncertainty less than 1 ppm in \nsimulating the lowest error values is possible by the method \npresented. Moreover, the proposed analytical expressions make \nit easy to calculate b oth the magnitude of the reference values \nand the associated measurement uncertainty. The simulation \nresults by the Monte Carlo method, which are shown in Table 7 \nand Table 8, provide grounds to consider the evaluation of the \nmeasurement uncertainty to be correct. There are a large number \nof commercial c omparators, and the user could check the \naccuracy of such a device using conventional precision \nmeasuring instruments  through the proposed  method. The \nmeasurement setup was tested several times using CA507 \ncomparators. Also, the results can be extended to other types of \ncomparators of almost identical currents, such as AITTS (India) \nor HGQA-C (China), which were characteri sed by the method \nthat differs from the described one by the use of an oscilloscope \nfor determining the phase shift angle and  has somewhat worse \nmathematical processing [21]. \nHowever, some issues need to be addressed. The analysis of \nthe uncertainty budget (regarding Table 1 – Table 4 of Section \n4.2) gives grounds for claiming that the total uncertainty can be \nsignificantly reduced also in the simulation of CT errors of about \n1000 µA/A when additional measures are applied. The \nclarification of measurement uncertainty of a current (the use of \nprecision ammeter), branching factor (the rigorous estimation of \nthe input impedance of a voltmeter) can lead to a reduction of \nthe total uncertainty of measurements. \nThe relationship between the amplitude and angular \ncomponents of the simulated current difference has a great \ninfluence on the uncertainty estimation. The smaller the \namplitude portion the smaller the measurement uncertainty of \nthe a ngular component and vice versa. This is a direction for \nrefining the measurement results. \nThe application of advanced technologies of data acquisition \nby replacement of voltmeter, phase meter by high -speed sample \nmeasuring devices with the subsequent auto matic calculation of \nboth reference values of errors and uncertainty of measurements \nshould be also the direction of further improvement. \n8. CONCLUSIONS \nThe presented measurement setup can be applied to simulate \nthe errors of CTs in a wide range of values wit h a small step of \nchanging the simulated characteristics. \nThe mathematical models derived for the determination of \nRE and PD in simulating these characteristics made it possible \nto obtain reference values for the characterisation of the CT \ncalibration unit. \nThe measurement uncertainties evaluated in simulating the \nRE and PD allowed us to assume that the proposed method is \nadvisable to apply in verifying the calibration unit for the \nlaboratory CTs, especially in the range from 1 to 1000 µA/A \n(µrad). \nThe analysis of uncertainty sources allowed determining the \nvalue of the current phase shift between currents (0 °, 90°, 180°, \nand 270º) which leads to a rapid increase of the total relative \nmeasurement uncertainty. \nIn determining the RE, the formation of the ratio  of the \ncurrents, at which the PD goes to zero, allows minim ising the \ncontribution of the current phase shift. \nREFERENCES \n[1] P.
