    "abstract": "The construction sector is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions and a major consumer of non-renewable resources. Architectural design decisions play a critical role in a building’s carbon footprint, making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design.",
