  "abstract": "Academic integrity has been a constant issue for higher education, already heightened by the easy availability of essay mill and contract cheating services over the Internet. Jurisdictions across the world have passed a range of laws making it an offence to offer or advertise such services. Because of the nature of these services, which may make students agree to not submit work they create or support, some of these offences have been drafted extremely broadly, without intent or knowledge requirements. The consequence of this is that there sit on statute books a range of very wide offences covering the support of, partial or complete authoring of assignments or work.At the same time, AI systems have become part of public consciousness, particularly since the launch of chatGPT from OpenAI. These large language models have quickly become part of workflows in many areas, and are widely used by students. These have concerned higher education institutions as they highly resemble essay mills in their functioning and result.This paper attempts to unravel the intersection between essay mills, general purpose AI services, and emerging academic cheating law. We:. Analyse, in context, academic cheating legislation from jurisdictions including England and Wales, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, US States, and Austria in light of how it applies to both essay mills, AI-enhanced essay mills, and general purpose AI providers. (Chapter 2). Examine and document currently available services by new AI-enhanced essay mills, characterising them and examining the way they present themselves both on their own websites and apps, and in advertising on major social media platforms including Instagram and TikTok. These include systems which both write entire essays as well as those designed to reference AI-created work, provide outlines, and to deliberately ‘humanise’ text as to avoid nascent AI detectors. (Chapter 3). Outline the tensions between academic cheating legal regimes and both AI-enhanced essay mills and general purpose AI systems, which can allow students to cheat in much the same way. (Chapter 4). Provide recommendations to legislators and regulators about how to design regimes which both effectively limit AI powered contract cheating without, as some current jurisdictions without accidentally bringing bone fide general purpose AI systems into scope unnecessarily. (Chapter 5)We make some important findings.Firstly, there is already a significant market of AI-enhanced essay mills, many of which are developing features directly designed to frustrate education providers’ current attempts to detect and mitigate the academic integrity implications of AI generated work.Secondly, some jurisdictions have scoped their laws so widely, that it is hard to see how ‘general purpose’ large language models such as Open AI’s GPT-4 or Google’s Bard would not fall into their provisions, and thus be committing a criminal offence through their provision. This is particularly the case in England and Wales and in Australia.Thirdly, the boundaries between assistance and cheating are being directly blurred by essay mills utilizing AI tools. Most enforcement, given the nature of the academic cheating regimes, we suspect will result from private enforcement, rather than prosecutions. These regimes interact in important and until now unexplored ways with other legal regimes, such as the EU’s Digital Services Act, the UK’s proposed Online Safety Bill, and contractual governance mechanisms such as the terms of service of AI API providers, and the licensing terms of open source models.",

Large language models \nmeet contract cheating law\nNoëlle Gaumann and Michael Veale\nFaculty of Laws, University College London, London, United Kingdom\nABSTRACT  \nMany jurisdictions have passed very broadly drafted laws to tackle \nacademic integrity issues, criminalising the provision or \nadvertising of contract cheating or essay mills, such as the Skills \nand Post-16 Education Act 2022 in England and Wales. Recently, \nAI models such as chatGPT have ampliﬁed academic concerns. \nHere, we look at the intersection between these phenomena. We \nreview academic cheating laws, showing that several may apply \neven to general-purpose AI services like chatGPT, without \nknowledge and intent. We identify a range of illegal adverts for \nAI-enhanced essay mills, and illustrate how di-cult it is to draw \nthe line between writing an essay and supporting it, such as by \ngenerating bone ﬁde references. We also outline the consequences \nfor intermediaries hosting these ads or providing these services, \nwhich may be signiﬁcantly a1ected by these primarily symbolic \nlaws. We conclude with a series of recommendations for \npolicymakers, legislators, and education providers.\nKEYWORDS  \nContract cheating; essay \nmills; large language models; \nAI; academic integrity\nIntroduction\nProviding or advertising essay mills and contract cheating has been a criminal o1ence in \nEngland and Wales since the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022 (the Skills Act). This \nfollows similar legislation passed in multiple over the last two decades, amidst calls \nfrom organisations such as the Council of Europe for these very laws.\n1\nAlso in 2022, OpenAI released chatGPT , a large language model stimulating academic \nintegrity concerns. They were rapidly followed by other providers such as Google (Bard), \nAnthropic AI (Claude), and Meta (LLaMA). These technologies can provide varied assist -\nance to individuals completing assignments – from research and editing to substantial \nor complete authorship.\n2\nThe education sector has rushed to create policies and practices \nin the wake of this disruption.\nThese two events were not linked, but they interact.\n© 2024 The Author(s).

They typi -\ncally claim to o1er general educational support. Consequently legislative frameworks \nhave often cast o1ences widely to attempt to bring services within scope. This often \nhas led to few if any intent requirement, and additional o1ences relating to advertising.\nA wide net has di-cult to delimit edges. ‘General purpose’ AI language models do not \nmake claims to speciﬁc functionality but can be deployed in a wide variety of ways by end \nusers, including for the creation of assessment materials. Like essay mills, their providers \ntypically have commercial motivations. This leaves a distinction between the two di-cult \nto draw, and yet to be explored. In this paper, we explore this possibility of liability, and its \npractical consequences for AI providers and varied intermediaries, across multiple \njurisdictions.\nAfter a background on essay mill laws, and a review of legislation across jurisdictions, \nwe outline the emerging AI business model in light of these regimes. Analysing the ten -\nsions we ﬁnd, we conclude with directions for policymakers and thoughts on the future of \nthese two developing trends.\nBackground: contract cheating and essay mills\nContract cheating can be deﬁned as students submitting work for academic credit, for \nwhich a third party provided non-permitted assistance, typically for payment.\n3\nStudent \ncheat for many reasons, from academic pressure, a lack of capacity for full-time study \ndue to ﬁnancial needs,\n4\nor limited language skills and in6uential online advertising,\n5\nthreatening degree standards and the integrity of the higher education sector.\n6\nSuch \nﬁrms on occasion even blackmail and extort students with the threat of reporting their \nmisconduct.\n7\nTo seek to escape liability, essay mills often state in their terms and con -\nditions that work should only be used as a point of reference.\n8\nOpportunities within pro -\ngrammes for misconduct also grew following the growth of at-home examinations during \nand after Covid-19.\n9\nEmergence of contract cheating law\nEssay mills have long been of legislative concern. California addressed essay mills \nin its Education Code in 1976, and other states followed. Many of these laws are \n3\nThe Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, ‘Contracting to Cheat in Higher Education’ ( QAA , 20 September \n2022) < https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/guidance/contracting-to-cheat-in-higher-education-third-edition.pdf > 3.\n4\nQAA (n 3) 10–11.\n5\nHC Deb 10 February 2021, vol 689, col 350; Tracey Bretag and others, ‘Contract Cheating: A Survey of Australian Univer -\nsity Students’ (2019) 44 Studies in Higher Education 1837.\n6\nQAA (n 3) 9–10.\n7\nHC Deb 10 February 2021, vol 689, col 350; QAA (n 3) 9.

Other jurisdictions, \nsuch as Canada, have seen legislation proposals, as early as 50 years ago, which failed \nto materialise.\n11\nSome civil law countries, such as Austria, have also recently in 2021 \naddressed essay mills in their code of education, although as an administrative rather \nthan criminal o1ence. We look at this legislation below.\nAnalysis of legislation\nStarting with the early examples, we ﬁnd the United States of America . In the US, edu -\ncation is mostly a state matter. 17 out of 50 states address contract cheating as part of a \nlegal regime.\n12\nThese states are Massachusetts,\n13\nPennsylvania,\n14\nNevada,\n15\nNew Jersey,\n16\nColorado,\n17\nConnecticut,\n18\nMaryland,\n19\nOregon,\n20\nWashington,\n21\nVirginia,\n22\nTexas,\n23\nNew York,\n24\nFlorida,\n25\nCalifornia,\n26\nNorth Carolina,\n27\nIllinois,\n28\nand Maine.\n29\nAs examples, \nwe will look at California, Maryland and Florida. We draw on select components of the \nremaining laws later in the analysis where relevant.\nFrom 1976 onwards, the California Education Code prohibited any distribution, prep -\naration and selling of, as well as o1ering or causing to prepare, any written material for \ncompensation at higher education institutions.\n30\nThe person must have known or reason -\nably known that the material would be submitted for academic credit. If a person makes \nor disseminates any statement, regarding the above-mentioned acts, with the intent to \ninduce any other person to enter any obligation relating thereto, they will incur liability.\n31\nCourts may grant adequate relief.\n32\nThe o1ence in Maryland has a signiﬁcantly wider scope. Its base o1ence states that ‘[a] \nperson may not sell or o1er for sale any assistance in the preparation, research, or writing \n10\nDates where they passed can be found in the database maintained by Mary McCormick and Hunter Whaley, Term Paper \nMills: Statutes and Legislative Information (Florida State University College of Law Research Center, 2019) < https:// \nguides.law.fsu.edu/termpapermills/statutesandlegislativeinformation > accessed 2 September 2023.\n11\nSarah Elaine Eaton, ‘Contract Cheating in Canada: A Comprehensive Overview’ in Sarah Elaine Eaton and Julia Christen -\nsen Hughes (eds), Academic Integrity in Canada: An Enduring and Essential Challenge (Springer 2022).\n12\nPhilip M Newton and Christopher Lang, ‘Custom Essay Writers, Freelancers, and Other Paid Third Parties’ in Tracey \nBretag (ed), Handbook of Academic Integrity (Springer 2016); McCormick and Whaley (n 10).\n13\nMass.

This o1ence was ﬁrst \nstated as part of the now-repealed Education Act 1989, based on an amendment in \n2011.\n36\nThere are no substantive di1erences between the two versions. Yet in contrast \nto many other regimes studied there is a general intent requirement to give a student \nan unfair advantage, which has been criticised, including in the UK House of Lords \nwhere it formed the basis of an (unsuccessful) 2017 proposed law.\n37\nLiability in \nNew Zealand is limited to a maximum ﬁne of 10,000 NZD.\n38\nThe New Zealand Qualiﬁ -\ncations Authority (NZQA) has standard investigatory powers, such as entering pre -\nmises,\n39\nand can issue compliance notices,\n40\nbut has no direct prosecuting powers. \nThis o1ence has seemingly been applied only once in 2014.\n41\nProceedings were \ninitiated after the NZQA received allegations that a company, Ateama Limited, was \nselling assignments to Chinese students. The case was resolved through a court conﬁ -\nscation to seize the property of a contract cheating company for further \ninvestigation.\n42\nIn Ireland , the relevant legislation criminalising essay mills and contract cheating is the \nQualiﬁcations and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, s 43A. The \namendment was inserted in November 2019 by the Qualiﬁcations and Quality Assurance \n(Education and Training) (Amendment) Act 2019 (32/2019), s 15, S.I. No. 540 of 2019. It is \nbased on the New Zealand o1ence\n43\nbut di1erent in that it has a variation without an \nintent requirement, with di1ering penalties. In Ireland it is similarly illegal to advertise \nor publish an advertisement relating to any of the acts above. Intermediaries may be \nliable, subject to any liability shielding, e.g. awareness.\n44\nQuality and Qualiﬁcations \n33\nMd. Code, Education § 26-201(2).\n34\nFla. Stat.

New criminal o1ences were to provide or advertise an aca -\ndemic cheating service on a commercial basis.\n47\nThe penalty is 2 years imprisonment \nor 500 penalty units, or both.\n48\nImprisonment is only an available penalty if the arrange -\nment had a commercial purpose.\n49\nProof of provision to a speciﬁc student is not necess -\nary, limiting the evidential burden.\n50\nAdvertising academic cheating services is prohibited \nwith the same penalties.\n51\nThe Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) \nis responsible for administering the law. It can take out injunctions against overseas web -\nsites, pursue prosecutions and gather intelligence.\n52\nIn the 2018–2019 budget, the gov -\nernment provided one-o1 1.1 m AUD and 660,000 AUD in ongoing annual funding to \nrespond to cheating activity.\n53\nThe authors could ﬁnd no other jurisdiction where a dedi -\ncated budget was provided to combat academic cheating activity.\nThis regime has seen enforcement activity, primarily by blocking access to the websites \nattracting the most tra-c.\n54\nTEQSA monitors about 600 websites and blocked access from \nAustralia to 40 websites which commanded about half a million visits every month in \n2022. Even though the legislation was enacted in 2019, compliance action increased \nimmensely in 2022. TEQSA was able to block websites without court action because of \nprotocols negotiated with Australia’s major internet service providers (ISPs) through \ntheir representative association.\n55\nThis was signiﬁcantly more e1ective than relying on \ncourt orders. In October 2021, there was one injunction against an essay mill, likely in \nIndia.\n56\nThe injunction applies until 2026, is binding on many Australian ISPs and requires \nthem to block access to the domain names, internet protocol (IP) addresses or uniform \nresource locators (URLs).\n57\nTEQSA also exchanges information about contract cheating \nwith Ireland.\n58\n45\nAnna McKie, ‘Irish Law to Clamp Down on Essay Mills “Could Be Model for UK”’ ( Times Higher Education (THE) , \n9 August 2018) < https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/irish-law-clamp-down-essay-mills-could-be-model- \nuk > accessed 3 September 2023.\n46\nibid.\n47\nTertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act (Australia) 2011 s 5 (hereafter TEQSA Act).\n48\nA penalty unit describes a ﬁnancial penalty, with the units themselves set to increase with inﬂation.

GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nAustria introduced an o1ence for ‘ghostwriting’ in higher education in 2021 as an \namendment to the university law.\n59\nIt is an o1ence to produce a work for another \nperson, whether for a fee or without, or to make it available to another person if the pro -\nvider knows or can assume based on the circumstances that it will be used in part or in full \nfor any paper, exam or thesis (including artistic work). In e1ect, the o1ence contains a \nknowledge requirement with a low threshold. Fines can reach 25,000 EUR,\n60\nor 60,000 \nEUR and a maximum of four weeks imprisonment where there is intention of generating \nongoing income.\n61\nThe lower penalty is an administrative o1ence ( Verwaltungsübertre -\ntung ) rather than a criminal one, prosecuted by the local district administrative auth -\nority.\n62\nHowever, the scope of the o1ence excludes non-universities, even excluding \nuniversities of applied sciences ( Fachhochschulen ), private universities and teacher train -\ning colleges.\n63\nReported e1ectiveness appears low, with the same ghostwriter agencies \nappearing in 2023 in in Austrian Google search results,\n64\nalthough some providers refus -\ning clients with Austrian email addresses.\n65\nMost recently, in England and Wales , the provision and advertisement of \nrelevant services was criminalised under the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022 \n(the Skills Act). Liability is not on students\n66\nbut on entities commercially providing\n67\nrelevant services – completion of all or some of a student’s work such that it can no \nlonger be considered that student’s work.\n68\nThe jurisdictional scope is a little confusing \ndue to devolution of education but not criminal law – o1ences can be committed in \neither England or Wales but only in relation to students at English institutions.\n69\nThe \nprovisions were not initially in the Skills Bill, but added in the Lords as a concession \nafter debate, following the similar issue raised in a Private Member’s Bill by Lord Storey,\n70\n59\nUniversitätsgesetz 2002 (UG), Bundesgesetz über die Organisation der Universitäten und ihre Studien, BGBl I Nr 120/ \n2002, amended by BGBl I Nr 93/2021 (Austria) § 116a.\n60\nIbid § 116a(1).\n61\nIbid § 116a(4).\n62\nThe örtlich zuständige Bezirksverwaltungsbehörde ; ibid § 116a(7).\n63\nTheo Anders, ‘Schlupﬂoch für Ghostwriter: Faßmann will trotz Warnungen nichts ändern’ ( Der Standard , 23 March 2021) \n< https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000125235403/schlupﬂoch-fuer-ghostwriter-fassmann-will-trotz-warnungen- \nnichts-aendern > accessed 3 September 2023.\n64\nAschendor4 Medien, ‘Ist ein Ghostwriter-Verbot sinnvoll?’ ( Westfalen-Blatt , 6 March 2023) < https://www.westfalen- \nblatt.de/freizeit/ratgeber/ist-ein-ghostwriter-verbot-sinnvoll-2718027 > accessed 3 September 2023.\n65\n‘So umgehen Ghostwriter-Agenturen die UG-Novelle’ ( Kronen Zeitung , 29 September 2021) < https://www.krone.at/ \n2518166 > accessed 3 September 2023.\n66\nSkills Act, s 27(1)(6).

Some \n‘open-source’\n95\nmodels like Meta’s LLaMA 2\n96\nor BigScience’s BLOOM\n97\ncan be down -\nloaded and run on users’ own computers, with advances in both hardware and model \ndesign making this increasingly feasible,\n98\nand apps serving as easy to use ‘wrappers’ \naround the more technical challenges of doing this.\n99\nMost students are however currently likely to interact directly or indirectly through \ncloud application programming interfaces, or APIs.\n100\nModels are hosted on another \nservice, and apps or websites query that service. Students can directly create accounts \nto do this with models they download or pay the low-level providers directly for \n(making it similar to downloading them on their own device), but they are also likely \nto interact with these models through intermediaries. Model providers can serve \nmodels through cloud services include Amazon Bedrock, Google PaLM API, OpenAI Plat -\nform, Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, or Microsoft Azure AI.\nOther app providers can also build services – including essay writing services – on top \nof these services, tailoring them to speciﬁc customers and needs, and market these \ndirectly to students. The best-known direct consumer facing service is chatGPT from \nOpenAI, which queries its GPT-4 model, but other providers also provide versions of \nchatGPT both within the same website (including tailored for essay writing), and on \nother apps. AI essay writing services will typically consist of a high performance model \nfrom a major model provider, perhaps tweaked by the application user, hosted on a \nmajor cloud platform, being queried on-demand on the basis of student requests with \nparameters designed by the app provider to give desired results. Some of these apps \nmay even be extremely household – such as Microsoft’s intention to integrate GPT-4 \nand similar technologies into O-ce 365.\nFigure 1 illustrates some of the data 6ows between an individual (on the left) querying \na model, and an individual getting a response to their query (right), amidst the many \nactors in the AI ecosystem. When we talk of an ‘AI provider’, we might be talking about \nthe services that provide the mode, that ﬁnetune and deploy it, that provide an interface \nto it alongside multiple models and services, or a mixture of the above.\nThese supply chains are likely to be conﬁgured in varied ways in relation to services \nundermining academic integrity. Essay mills may themselves be AI providers, pretending \nto sell essays that are written by humans, but created with AI. Plugins and software \ndesigned to allow students to cheat on at-home exams proctored or invigilated using \n‘lockdown browsers’ or webcams may emerge (although e1ective methods which \ndefeat these techniques, such as running browsers within virtual machines, already \nexist).

To do so, we drew on both \nsearches in using conventional search engines and also the advertising archives \nrequired of large platforms by the EU Digital Services Act (DSA).\n101\nWhen queried \nwith terms such as ‘essay’, ‘university’, ‘coursework’, ‘thesis’ and ‘dissertation’, a wide \narray of providers are shown which could be then examined both on that platform \nand elsewhere.\nAI essay writing services\nSome ﬁrms operate similarly to existing contract cheating or essay mills, but claim to use \nAI. This may initially seem like a downside, but ﬁrms appear to use this to di1erentiate on \nspeed and price. EssayAid claims to write an essay ‘in 24 hours with the power of AI’. \nThere is scarce information on its website, although it advertises on TikTok and is regis -\ntered in the United Kingdom. Its domain name is registered by an English company, \nand therefore would likely be in breach of both the relevant service provision and adver -\ntising provisions of the Skills Act ( Figure 2 ).\nFigure 1.

EssayGenius ( Figure 3 ) o1ers an interface which \nallows individuals to enter a prompt and receive an essay in return, and to restructure \nand rephrase parts of the essay.\n102\nAITaskWizard is a similar service, advertising itself as ‘perfect for A-level and GCSE stu -\ndents’. It promises an ‘inbuild humanizer’ which ‘can be useful for avoiding plagiarism’. It \ncharges 3.99 USD/month for a premium plan. It does not have terms and conditions, a \nlocation, and it shields its WHOIS domain registration entry. However, it does advertise \nto the UK on TikTok, where it claims to be registered in the United Kingdom. The \nwebsite is simplistic and has several idiosyncratic features, suggesting that this is not a \ncorporate e1ort, but may be an individual simply placing a wrapper around a large \nﬁrm’s AI API and repurposing it with a user interface, and potentially some post- \nprocessing.\nWhile all aforementioned are websites, several apps also exist. This introduces a new \nintermediary, the app store, which plays a signiﬁcant role as a de facto contemporary \nregulator.\n103\nOne app is Friday: AI Essay Writing , produced by the Swiss company Sekterra GmbH. \nThis ﬁrm heavily advertises on TikTok ( Figure 4 ), mainly to indicate that its texts pass pla -\ngiarism detection that others do not. The adverts heavily use images of classrooms, \nassignments, and teachers detecting chatGPT -written scripts.\nPlagiarism camouEage services\nSome services advertise primarily that they help students rephrase texts in a way that will \nconfound detectors such as Turnitin , rather than ﬁrms which claim their AI-generated \ntexts are resistant to detection by default.\nQuilbot , a company owned by Course Hero (trading name of Learneo Inc., which also \nowns Cli1Notes), sells a service with which students can use to re-write AI-generated \ntexts. This service, it appears, assists students in avoiding plagiarism detectors – their \npremium version (100 USD a year) resells the services of CopyLeaks , which is a plagiarism \ndetector like Turnitin, allowing students to check whether their text would trigger a detec -\ntor or not. The service is based in Illinois, which has laws prohibiting essay mills,\n104\nand \nadvertises in the United Kingdom ( Figure 5 ).\nIt is worth noting that the advertising o1ence would appear to extend to Google and \nMeta, where liability may accrue when they are notiﬁed and if they refuse takedown. \nWhile Quillbot o1ers entire writing services, including services to rewrite and cite \nsources, the re-writing feature is worth considering. Neither English nor Illinois law expli -\ncitly contemplates services which attempt to fool attempts to detect plagiarism. However, \nunder English law, this service can be conceived as completing ‘part’ of an assignment in a \nway that ‘could not reasonably be considered’ to have been completed by the student, as \n102\nWe could not determine this ﬁrm’s location.\n103\nJoris van Hoboken and Ronan Ó Fathaigh, ‘Smartphone Platforms as Privacy Regulators’ (2021) 41 Computer Law & \nSecurity Review 105557; Josh Cowls and Jessica Morley, ‘App Store Governance: The Implications and Limitations of \nDuopolistic Dominance’ in Jakob Mökander and Marta Ziosi (eds), The 2021 Yearbook of the Digital Ethics Lab (Springer \n2022).\n104\nIllinois law creates an o4ence for an advertiser, preparer or seller to purposefully engage ‘in a course of conduct which \nhe reasonably should have known would result in the submission of such academic papers, substantially unchanged’ to \naccredited higher education institution in the state. 110 Ill.

This is important as educators often \nanecdotally believe that AI systems are incapable of detecting accurate references, allow -\ning real work to be distinguished from generated work.\nWords and Paper is an app that claims to integrate web searches to generate refer -\nenced essays that pass plagiarism checks. It speciﬁcally namechecks Quillbot, discussed \nabove, as being unable to do so to distinguish itself on TikTok. TikTok notes its registered \nlocation as the United Kingdom, although its privacy policy and terms and conditions on \nthe Apple App Store link to a shared Google Doc. It advertises itself as being able to gen -\nerate an outline, which users edit, and which it expands using AI-generated text. To that \nend, it appears to resemble systems like AutoGPT , which integrate the querying of large \nlanguage models with the introduction of new text as a result of the language model \nitself directing a Web search ( Figure 8 ).\n107\nScite ( Figure 9 ) sells a tool that claims to allow researchers to see more about the context in \nwhich certain work was cited. However, its ‘Assistant’ tool, similar to Words and Paper, claims \nto check a wide range of academic sources by generating search terms, then querying papers, \nand generating a reference list and in-essay citations to match. The ﬁrm advertises explicitly to \nstudents on Meta\n108\nand on Google,\n109\nalthough with no explicit mentions of essays.\nBrainstormGPT is a Singaporean company (Cyberspace Imagination Pte. Ltd.) which \no1ers meeting summarisation and reporting tools on its website. However, their adver -\ntisements tell a di1erent story ( Figure 10 ), claiming to ‘get an essay in 20 minutes’ and \nprovide ‘reliable sources’ and ‘fresh ideas’, providing ‘more than just essay structure’.\nFinally, Source.ly invites users to copy and paste work they have generated using AI \ntools into its system which will return a list of online references which they can use to \nFigure 8.

Some, such as Quillbot or EasyEssay, are a little \nmore subtle, o1ering plagiarism detection checks, and in the case of Quillbot, advertising \nto create outlines, write in a scholarly manner and write faster, but do not go so far as \nsaying they are designed to avoid such checks. However, they o1er the same service. \nOthers (e.g. Scite, BrainstormGPT) advertise to students, and showcase their capabilities \nat writing an ‘essay’, but seem to aim themselves at a research or enterprise market, \nand do not engage with the misuse of their tool, even though they design the system \nto reference in the style of an academic paper.\nHowever, it is worth noting that most of these tools appear to be wrappers around \nthe language models trained by others. It appears they pass or rephrase prompts, or \nuse chains of prompts to get di1erent results, but these are all techniques that \nusers can do with general purpose providers alone, particularly with the help of \nprompting guides and similar. As we will see below, given the intent requirements \nare loose in some jurisdictions’ laws, this raises a challenging question. If these tools \nshould be considered academic cheating service providers – then where is the line \nexactly drawn?\nTensions\nIt is likely that students will increasingly use AI for academic cheating rather than essay \nmills, because of the lack of risk for blackmailing as well as the free availability of many \nincreasingly sophisticated AI models. Commentators have argued that in the future \nessay mills may seek to di1erentiate themselves against AI, machine-written services, as \nstudents may only be willing to pay for higher quality services.\n111\nHowever, as we have \nseen, it also seems likely that essay mills incorporate AI services. Consequently, the two \nmay become more blurred than distinct. While essay mills may not become irrelevant, \ncheating employing AI models may become the predominant form of third-party \ncheating.\nWe will analyse the issues of addressing academic cheating using AI through current \nessay mill legislation, keeping in mind there remains an ongoing discussion about the \nextent to which AI should be classiﬁed as academic cheating. We, therefore, focus on \ntimes when the substantive use of AI has been expressly forbidden.\nThis section will contain a categorisation of the main tensions between AI systems and \nthe various legal regimes, indicating the relevant jurisdictions.\nThe main tensions which emerge are: \n(1) relevant services;\n(2) knowledge and intent;\n(3) commercial nature;\n(4) extraterritoriality;\n(5) intermediaries/advertising; and\n(6) enforcement.\n111\nThomas Williams, ‘Essay Mills “under Threat from Rise of ChatGPT”’ ( Times Higher Education (THE) , 2 March 2023) \n< https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/essay-mills-under-threat-rise-chatgpt > accessed 5 September 2023; \nThomas Lancaster, ‘Cheating with Artiﬁcial Intelligence – Addressing The Consequences’ < https://thomaslancaster. \nco.uk/blog/cheating-with-artiﬁcial-intelligence-addressing-the-consequences/ > accessed 5 September 2023.\nINFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW 293\nScope of relevant services\nWhat counts as a relevant service di1ers by instrument, which we examine here in context \nof the empirical work on the market presented above.\nStudents may use an AI model for high level tasks such as outlining or searching for \nresources. They might use the assignment prompt, potentially with ancillary information \nand documents, to write the essay to receive an outline for an assignment or to search \nfor source material, i.e. for high-level tasks. They may use an AI model to write the entire \nassignment by giving some input with desirable information (collated by the students \nthemselves) or even just the assignment prompt, letting the language model write every -\nthing. A student may co-write an essay with AI by continuously amending each output and \nthe student writing many elements themselves. An AI model may also be used merely to \nimprove the clarity of an assignment by cross-checking whether the essay accurately corre -\nsponds to the question. For the least substantive, and perhaop, they may improve phrasing, \ngrammar and style, much as spell-checkers built into word processors have long facilitated.\nAI systems may facilitate one or more of these use cases. Under what conditions, if any, \ncould this fall into the scope of the legislation outlined above? As we will see, this di1ers \nwidely.\nSupport or assignment production?\nEven high-level assistance may be a relevant service in some jurisdictions. We categorise \njurisdictions by their scope in this regard below, and summarise in Table 1 .\nPreparation, research or assistance . Maryland speciﬁcally prohibits sale of assistance in \n‘preparation, research, or writing’.\n112\nOregon widens this to ‘any assistance’.\n113\nMassachu -\nsetts includes in the concept of the work that could be submitted ‘research results’ or \n‘substantial material therefrom’.\n114\nAll of these imply an extremely wide scope; \nhowever, they are all tempered by having a knowledge requirement (discussed below). \nFlorida has a potentially wide scope, although parts of the provision seem internally con -\ntradictory. The o1ence itself states that the scope should be o1ering work that the seller \nor advertiser should have known was intended for submission without substantial altera -\ntion. However, exempt services do not include those which include ‘ the preparation, \nresearch or writing’ of work (emphasis added) – widening the scope from simply the \ncreation of ﬁnal or near-ﬁnal content.\n115\nPartial, or reasonably consider to be part of . A ‘part’ could be understood as a ‘part’ of a \ndocument, such as a chapter or section, or as a ‘part’ of a task (as Australia’s legislation \nexplicitly does). In assessment, the task being assessed is often the process not just the \nﬁnal piece alone – hence the restrictions on how writing can be produced, with the artifact \nserving to evidence the task. Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania explicitly include \noccurrences where a ‘substantial part’ of the assignment has been obtained. Ireland’s \nlegislation supports a similar construction, where a person is ‘undertaking in whole or \n112\nMd. Code, Education § 26-201(b) (current through 2022).\n113\nOr. Rev. Stat. § 165.114(2) (current through 2022).\n114\nMass. Gen. Laws ch 271, § 50 (current through 2022).\n115\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 877.17 (West current through 2022).\n294 N. GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nin part’ an assignment or other work. Austria’s legislation is narrower focussing on \n‘achievements’, although it is plausible a process might be part of this. However, as Aus -\ntrian legislation talks oof producing or making available an entire piece of work ( ein Werk ) \nfor another person, this may exclude more distant preparation support.\nBoth Australia and England and Wales relax the deﬁnition of ‘part’ further by adding a \ntest of reasonable perception, with England and Wales discussing where ‘all or part of an \nassignment on behalf of a student’ where an assignment in that way ‘could not reason -\nably be considered to have been completed personally’ by that student; and Australia the \nstricter requirement that the service can ‘reasonably be regarded as being, or forming a \nsubstantial part’ of that assessment ‘task’.\n116\nSubmittable, full assignments . Other legislation seems to rule out such high-level gui -\ndance or components. While California includes any ‘written material’, it must be able \nto be submitted as the assignment itself. Colorado, New York, Texas, Virginia and \nWashington have similar constructions. In New Zealand, the services are limited to \nthose where assignments are ‘completed’, ‘provided’ or ‘arranged’. The limit to, in \nvarying wording, the whole assignment can also be found in Maine, North Carolina and \nNevada. This does not rule out AI-created assignments but does narrow the scope to \nwhere systems produce ﬁnished or near-ﬁnished pieces, rather than used interactively \nand/or iteratively, such as ‘co-writing’ tools or outlines. Florida, if read restrictively \nwithout reference to the mentioned exemptions, and Illinois also require the creation \nof work not substantially altered. While judicial interpretation may choose to include com -\nponents of the work, these statutes appear more restrictive than others we examined.\nAvailability exemptions\nIn cases where the scope is wide, legislation often includes exemptions concerning \nthe availability of work. Exempting a mass-produced study guide is one obvious \nTable 1.

The structure of the o1ence is \nunusual, as not being generally published material is a condition of an example, rather \nthan a clear exception to the deﬁnition of service – however, it seems designed to \nnarrow the o1ence.\nConsidering paid-for AI models, the only relevant exemption is that it would be \n‘included in a publication’, which a private API response is not. Consequently, we turn \nto consider ‘free’ (potentially ad-supported or similar) systems.\nWhile a free AI system is ‘available generally’, the content it produces is not, as it \nwill typically di1er each time (even with the same prompt) due to its stochastic nature, \nregular updates, and di1erent starting ‘seeds’. While it could be argued that the \nmaterial was ‘available generally without payment’, in the sense that an individual \ndid obtain it, without exclusivity or payment, the Bill’s explanatory notes indicated \nthat ‘[t]he o1ering of a menu of available essays which must be paid for, for \nexample, would not be considered material published generally since it does not \ninclude other educational or training material’.\n117\nAI systems similarly lack such \nother material.\nFlorida clariﬁes the law does not stop ‘any person or educational institution from pro -\nviding [..] information [..] unless this service includes the preparation, research or writing \nof a report or paper as [outlined in the o1ence].’ This exemption is a little circular in \nnature, but the intention seems to be similar to the England and Wales exemption.\nCommercial nature\nEngland and Wales requires that relevant services be provided commercially. Florida’s \nlaw applies to ‘sellers’. This excludes free help from family members, and some might \nargue would exclude freely available AI language models like chatGPT , and only apply \nto paid versions. However, Internet law has long had to deal with ﬁrms that indirectly \nmake revenue from users, with EU and UK law’s deﬁnition of an information society \nservice as one ‘normally provided for remuneration’, but which has not limited the \nscope of intermediaries to exclude advertising-supported ﬁrms.\n118\n‘Open’ and ‘free’ AI \nlanguage models are similarly deeply enmeshed in technology giants’ business \nstrategies.\n119\nIreland’s, California and New Zealand’s laws lack the requirements for commercial \ncircumstances and would therefore apply to both paid-for and freely available \nAI models in all interpretations, while in Australia and Austria, sanctions can di1er.\n120\n117\nExplanatory Notes to the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill (as brought from the House of Lords on 26 October 2021, Bill \n176), para 159.\n118\nThe Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002, reg 2.\n119\nDavid Gray Widder, Sarah West and Meredith Whittaker, ‘Open (For Business): Big Tech, Concentrated Power, and the \nPolitical Economy of Open AI’ (17 August 2023) < https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4543807 > accessed 29 August 2023.\n120\nIn Australia, commercial purposes will lead to a criminal sanction of 2 years imprisonment or 500 penalty units, or both. \nOn the contrary, the same act without commercial purposes will lead to a civil penalty of 500 penalty units — currently \nup to 156,500 AUD.

GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nIn sum, constraints on the services being provided commercially do not seem to fully \nexclude free-to-access AI services in any jurisdiction examined, given their current \nbusiness models, and in any case continue to include paid-for AI services.\nExtraterritoriality\nAfter Australia and Ireland criminalised essay mills, many reportedly left or closed \ndown.\n121\nSome German-language mills reportedly refused Austrian emails, but this is tri -\nvially circumvented.\n122\nIn an informationalised world, local restrictions matter little if you \ncan obtain from an overseas service.\nRegimes di1er in their territorial extent and e1ect. Australian legislation includes speciﬁc \npowers to issue Web blocking injunctions (e.g. to local ISPs) in the context of academic cheat -\ning services while other jurisdictions have to rely on generic powers where they exist. Australia \nalso applies ‘category D’ extended geographic jurisdiction, meaning that this o1ence applies \nwhether or not the result of the conduct occurs in Australia.\n123\nIn contrast, in England and \nWales, o1ences must be committed in England and Wales in relation to English institutions,\n124\nwhile Ireland, New Zealand or Austria omit territorial discussion in their laws.\nMost AI model companies are located in the United States. It would be politically \ndi-cult to block general-purpose services, and such a block could be challenged on \ngrounds including freedom of expression or to conduct a business. It may also create \neconomic damage domestically for businesses that rely on such APIs. Regulatory co-oper -\nation, such as the choice of OpenAI to stop serving Italy following an order by the Italian \nData Protection authority, seems preferable for such issues, but requires regulatory lever -\nage.\n125\nHowever, for narrow, illegal businesses, such as many essay mills, such a block may \nbe able to be targeted with few externalities. Often however, such blocks are just whack- \na-moles, as ﬁrms can easily change both their domain names and their IP addresses.\nAdvertising\nSeveral jurisdictions analysed above include an o1ence criminalising the advertisement of \nrelevant academic cheating services, as deﬁned in their respective acts. Advertising o1ences \nin England and Wales, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand di1er slightly but broadly apply to \nthose advertising in connection with the in-scope services. Australia implemented an integ -\nrity unit to prosecute and make use of the federal injunction powers to block advertising, \nalso through the aforementioned Web blocking powers.\n126\nAustria’s law is scoped slightly \ndi1erently, and thus has less potential to apply to intermediaries.\n121\nAnna McKie, ‘Essay Mills Quit Australia as UK Falls behind but Covid a Threat’ ( Times Higher Education (THE) , 18 Novem -\nber 2020) < https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/essay-mills-quit-australia-uk-falls-behind-covid-threat > \naccessed 4 September 2023.\n122\n‘So umgehen Ghostwriter-Agenturen die UG-Novelle’ ( Kronen Zeitung , 29 September 2021) < https://www.krone.at/ \n2518166 > accessed 3 September 2023.\n123\nTEQSA Act 2011(Australia) s 12; Criminal Code Act 1995 (Australia) s 15.4.\n124\nHM Government, ‘Skills and Post-16 Education Bill: Policy Summary Notes’ (November 2021) 57–58.\n125\nPier Giorgio Chiara, ‘Italian DPA v.

Before the \npassing of the Skills Act 2022, the ASA investigated essay mill ads in 2019 for being mislead -\ning. Websites proclaimed that students could submit work as their own without risks, argu -\nably in breach of the CAP Code (Edition 12) 3.1 and 3.3.\n131\nSimilarly, in February 2023 the ASA \nchallenged whether an ad by BrilliantMinds, an essay mill, misled students by implying they \ncould submit an essay they had bought as their own.\n132\nAny ASA rulings have the result that \nthe ads may not appear again in the form complained against. Usually, no ﬁnes result and \nservices typically agree to amend the ads. No prosecutions against intermediaries were \npursued by the CPS under the Skills Act, though this may have been because the companies \nwere in Scotland and o1ering services to Scottish students.\n133\nConceptually, applying the rules on advertising with this legislation is complex. That is \nbecause the often broadly drafted nature of these o1ences makes the service provided \ncontingent on how it is being used, particularly because some jurisdictions, as discussed \nabove, loosen or remove intent requirements. Yet advertising is all about intent – describing \na service such that individuals wish to use or purchase it. This creates a di-cult legal \nquestion – should an advertiser who advertises for a general-purpose service be held liable \nfor it? Intuitively, the answer should be yes – these provisions were typically designed to \n127\nIn some cases, platforms may beneﬁt from liability shielding due to unawareness of hosting such adverts, even where \nthey have done so for remuneration.

VEALE\ncapture essay mills even if they were advertising (as they do, and as they contractually seek \nassurance of) services which were di1erent from the student’s intended use, such as practice \nessays, rather than submittable work.\nIn sum, if relevant services in such laws encompass general purpose AI systems, insofar \nas they do, they would seem to also prohibit advertising of such systems, regardless of \nhow they were advertised. This could present a challenge for commercial activity of \nthese ﬁrms, and the intermediaries involved in publicising them.\nEnforcement\nMost regimes are only directly enforceable by normal prosecuting bodies. Some of them \nallow direct referral by universities (e.g. Illinois), but this too is rare. Given the nature of the \no1ence, this will likely lead to questionable levels of enforcement, particularly without \ndedicated enforcement bodies with knowledge of the higher education sector. In \nEngland and Wales, the CPS has not engaged in enforcement action, although the ASA \nhas taken action against advertisements in the past. Of the few dedicated enforcement \nbodies, the Australian body, TEQSA appears the most active, with a dedicated yearly \nenforcement budget of 660,000 AUD.\n134\nFigure 13.

Other laws interact to create interesting enforcement path -\nways. In particular, the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) \nplace obligations on certain intermediary internet services designed for (typically) user-to- \nuser content sharing.\nModel providers can be intermediaries in a variety of ways. They might intermediate \nusers and search results, thus acting somewhat as a search engine does (and as both \nBing Chat and Google Bard do). Providers might host ﬁnetuned versions of their model \nwhich are illegal, such as ﬁnetuned versions designed for writing academic essays. For \nexample, OpenAI hosts ‘Academic Assistant Pro’ as one of their top custom GPT models.\n135\nTwo main categories of obligation are relevant for the interaction between essay mill \nlaw and platform law. The ﬁrst concerns direct obligations that relate to illegal content. \nThe two regimes di1er a little in this respect; the OSA has obligations to use proportionate \nmeasures to detect and remove ‘priority illegal content’ and provides a notice and take -\ndown regime for ‘illegal content’. However, it seems unlikely that the o1ences in the Skills \nAct will qualify as a model for consideration even as base-level illegal content, as the \no1ence does not have individual victim(s) or intended victim(s).\n136\nThe advertising \no1ence might be understood this way, as the ‘victim’ is the individual being advertised \nto. The DSA has a much wider concept of ‘illegal content’, and national law essay mill \nlaw such as the Irish law examined above would seem to fall within its remit.\n137\nThe DSA however has a somewhat lower set of obligations that relate to such content, \nand we will focus on these alone due to the scope of the OSA. It provides that platforms \nmust create a mechanism by which they can be notiﬁed of suspected illegal activity, \nwhich in turn, if conﬁrmed, would remove their liability shielding and mean that they \nmay become liable for hosting this content, where the o1ence allows. Unlike the OSA, \nintermediaries do not ﬁnd themselves directly liable under the DSA for failing to \nremove certain categories of content; their liability continues to 6ow from the underlying \nlaw that would make the content illegal. If they are unafraid of prosecution for hosting a \ngeneral-purpose AI system that may be illegal under the above regime, then they are unli -\nkely to remove it on these grounds due to the legal risk seeming acceptable. This is par -\nticularly the case given that general-purpose AI systems have not yet been targeted by \nthe regimes outlined above. It is also not particularly new, as the main innovation of \nthe DSA in this space is to require an e1ective way to provide notice to platforms in \norder to lead their liability shield to fail – notice and takedown regimes have been \naround for over two decades in the EU, and are the norm around the world.\n138\nBoth regimes contain provisions which in e1ect oblige (some) intermediaries to pro -\nportionately enforce their terms and conditions.\n139\nAI providers often use contractual \n135\nSeemingly made by the owners of https://awesomegpts.vip/ .\n136\nOnline Safety Bill, cl. 59(5)(b).\n137\nDigital Services Act, recital 18.\n138\nIt is worth noting that at least two of the regimes described above, in Florida and in California, would not have these \nproblems in relation to intermediaries hosting models. The US’s ‘Section 230’ intermediary liability regime would not \nprotect the deployers of AI services directly, it would protect intermediaries regardless of whether or not they received \nnotice. See generally Matt Perault, ‘Section 230 Won’t Protect ChatGPT’ (2023) 3 Journal of Free Speech Law 363.\n139\nDigital Services Act, art 14(4); Online Safety Bill (23 July 2023) HL Bill 164 (as amended on Report) cl. 73(3)). The Online \nSafety Bill only requires this of ‘category 1’ services; the DSA requires it regardless of size (i.e. not just for the Very Large \nOnline Platforms (VLOPs) or Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs).\n300 N. GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nterms to try and govern downstream use.\n140\nThis is a typical legal technique to manage \nsupply chain risk. OpenAI, the producer of chatGPT , state that it is disallowed to use its \nservices for illegal activity in its Usage Policies .\n141\nOther AI actors include model market -\nplaces (e.g. Hugging Face ), which store models uploaded by others and provide them \nas a service, or systems such as Google’s AutoML , which allows third parties to customise \nand tailor models.\n142\nModel marketplaces like Hugging Face are the main location for the \ndistribution of open source, powerful language models such as Meta’s LLAMA and \nEleuther’s GPT-J , and in turn, are clear examples of internet intermediaries. Marketplaces \nsuch as Hugging Face have content moderation policies, which also forbid the hosting of \nillegal content.\nTypically and historically, terms of service have been sporadically and inconsistently \nenforced. However, intermediaries can be held directly liable for failing to enforce terms \nproportionately, including terms which state that they forbid illegal content. Whether \nsuch liability is possible depends on the nature of the service and the scope of the \nOSA and DSA in relation to it. In these cases, intermediaries will have to interpret \nthe laws above. Platforms will neither have recourse to courts to aid their interpretation \nnor to challenge any interpretation made by ﬁrms, were they to make take-down \ndecisions. This illustrates how vague law with symbolic purposes may create unchal -\nlengeable and di-cult-to-clarify legal e1ects.\nWe have already seen how intermediaries such as ISPs, PayPal and Facebook have been \nand can be targeted in relation to essay mills and advertising them. It seems that interme -\ndiaries may, again, be a place where these skirmishes play out, particularly due to their \ncross-jurisdictional nature.\nEssay mills themselves using AI systems\nIn most cases, essay mills will allocate an individual employee who will write an original \npiece of work for the student in exchange for payment. As mentioned in the parliamen -\ntary debates by Lord Lucas, essay mills and contract cheating services also make use of \nAI.\n143\nIn that context, he referred to the use of AI to disguise what essay mills ‘are creating \nbased on existing sources’ to evade detection by cheating software. This practice is clear \nin our reviewed services.\nThe essay mill itself naturally falls within the listed laws. What about the AI service \nbeing utilised? It seems unlikely that the upstream AI providers themselves would be \nthe ﬁrst point of liability unless they were well-aware of the nature of the service \nbeing provided to the user. Given that the structure of such services is typically to \nremain ignorant of the detailed activities of their users, and to deal with them at \narms-length through automated systems, there does not appear to be a signiﬁcant \ncurrent legal risk for these services. However, such analysis may change in the \nfuture, if these provided systems become enmeshed in more and more criminal activity, \nand laws and attitudes change.\n140\nMichael Veale, Kira Matus and Robert Gorwa, ‘AI and Global Governance: Modalities, Rationales, Tensions’ (2023) 19 \nAnnual Review of Law and Social Science.\n141\nOpenAI, ‘Usage Policies’ (23 March 2023) < https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies > accessed 2 September 2023.\n142\nSee generally Gorwa and Veale (n 98).\n143\nHL Deb 19 July 2021 vol 814 col 61.\nINFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW 301\nKnowledge and intent\nAs indicated in the discussion in the House of Lords in 2017,\n144\nproving intent to provide \nan unfair advantage or any other intent or knowledge requirement is already di-cult for \nessay mills and contract cheating providers. A knowledge requirement makes it easier for \nessay mills to hide behind a contractual clause stating that provided services should never \nbe handed in as original academic work. A 2017 study analysing 26 websites o1ering such \nservices found these types of clauses or disclaimers present on all websites studied.\n145\nSuch clauses are similarly common in general-purpose AI providers’ contracts. For \nexample, OpenAI’s usage policy includes a prohibition against ‘[f]raudulent or deceptive \nactivity, including: [..] academic dishonesty’.\n146\nThese clauses are part of broader attempts \nto govern AI systems and APIs through contractual means.\n147\nWe found no AI essay mills \nwith such clauses.\nThough di-cult in practice, it may be possible to understand the intent of essay mills \nand contract cheating providers through investigative methods, disclosure of correspon -\ndence, and testimony from employees. In contrast, the business model of general- \npurpose AI providers is typically one that is distant from the user, with the primary inter -\naction being programmatic, through APIs. Unlike essay mills, language model providers \nare aiming in practice at a wide variety of users, with some likely to be using the \nsystem for illegitimate or illegal ends.\nConsequently, for general-purpose providers with contractual exemptions, under stan -\ndard factual conditions re6ecting the AI-as-a-service industry today, an intent element \npresent will likely shield them from liability.\nLegislation without knowledge or intent elements\nThe o1ence in England and Wales lacks an intent element, is purely a strict liability \no1ence and avoids any issues of proof around the o1ence.\n148\nThis means that if the rel -\nevant services element is satisﬁed AI services, including general-purpose AI services, \ncould likely fall within the Skills Act o1ence on academic cheating. In Australia, strict \nliability applies to the physical element of circumstance for the ﬁrst two o1ences out -\nlined, concerning the deﬁnition of academic cheating service.\n149\nProvision of work for \nstudents, in circumstances where the work forms or could reasonably be seen to form \na substantial part of an assessment task that students are required to personally under -\ntake, will lead to liability.\nBoth instruments make it di-cult to distinguish between general-purpose AI providers \nand AI services advertising as essay mills, due to the lack of intent requirement. Given that \nAI essay mills seen above typically are a loose wrapper around general-purpose AI APIs \nsuch as those in the algorithmic supply chain, this creates signiﬁcant problems for the \nlaw’s scope.\n144\nHL Deb 25 January 2017, vol 778 col. 776.\n145\nMichael J Draper, Victoria Ibezim and Philip M Newton, ‘Are Essay Mills Committing Fraud?

GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nThe Irish provisions have two sections on academic cheating, one with an intent \nelement and one without. The section without an intent element applies primarily to \nundertaking ‘an assignment or any other work’ or ‘sitting an examination’ in ‘the enrolled \nlearner’s stead’ or providing ‘answers for the examination’. ‘Undertaking’ an assignment \ncontrasts with the intent required o1ence of ‘providing or arranging the provision of \nan assignment’ – indicating that the target of the ﬁrst o1ence are people who are repla -\ncing individuals in actual examinations, and likely limiting the scope to exclude AI.\nLegislation with knowledge or intent elements\nSome legislation requires the provider to intend to give students an unfair advantage. \nThis will be di-cult to prove with AI providers. Both Ireland\n150\nand New Zealand\n151\nhave such intent elements in parts of their legislation – unsurprisingly, as the Irish Act \nwas modelled after the New Zealand legislation.\n152\nThis might be proven for essay \nmills promising students a ﬁrst, but it will be di-cult to prove with general-purpose AI \nproviders. However, it may be possible if they are speciﬁed resellers and advertise their \nservices as such. Nevertheless, the di-culties of proof contributed to the removal of \nthe intent requirement in England and Wales, as discussed.\nKnowledge requirements are easier for AI providers to meet in principle but still pose \nchallenges. Austrian law contains a knowledge element. It is required that you know or \ncan assume based on the circumstances that a piece of work will be used in part or in \nfull as a seminar, examination, or ﬁnal thesis (bachelor thesis, scientiﬁc or artistic work). \nThis is also the case for California and Florida, among other US states, including those \nwith the wide scopes described above such as Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon. \nHowever, AI providers receive prompts as inputs, and would presumably argue that \nthey have no way of knowing whether this was just a prompt to do genuine research \nin authorised ways, to produce practice essays to study or examine (for example, on pre -\nvious years’ questions), or illegitimately submit. Cost seems to play an indirect part here. It \nmay be reasonable to ‘assume based on the circumstances’, as Austrian law indicates, that \nan essay will be for submission where a student is paying a signiﬁcant sum for it. Where \nthat sum is small, because the activity is fully automated, it seems plausible that they are \njust doing so for research, information or knowledge.\nIn sum, so far England and Wales and Australia look to have constructions that are \namenable to application to general-purpose AI providers, based on scope and the lack \nof intent or knowledge elements. The section of Ireland’s o1ence without intent elements \nseems too speciﬁcally aimed at individuals fraudulently sitting exams. Austria and several \nUS states have a knowledge, rather than an intent, requirement, which could be met by AI \nproviders, but will likely prove di-cult.\nInterim conclusions\nAustralia’s and England and Wales’ legal regimes are most likely to apply to general \npurpose AI services which do not explicitly advertise as contract cheating or essay mill \n150\nQQA(ET) Act 2012 (Ireland) s 43A(3).\n151\nEducation and Training Act 2020 (New Zealand) s 393(1)(a).\n152\nDáil Deb 12 June 2019, vol 983 col 5.\nINFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW 303\nservices, because they have at least one in-scope o1ence with strict liability, without a \nknowledge or intent requirement. It becomes hard to distinguish between ﬁrms that \nadvertise as being able to write essays, and ﬁrms, such as OpenAI, Google and similar, \nthat provide services that in practice have the same or similar functionality, but do not \nadvertise in this way. This is made more challenging still as these regimes do not care \nwhether the use of their technologies in this way is contractually forbidden through \nterms of service. As a result, it is clearly arguable that general purpose AI providers \nseem incompatible with some jurisdictions’ contract cheating laws.\nIn the bulk of the jurisdictions, the rules would apply to services that seem to adver -\ntise to students, claim to be able to write essays, or similar, depending on the scope of \nthe assistance in the legal regime. Some providers simply look like high-tech essay mills, \nmaking it natural for them to fall under laws designed to target essay mills. But this is \ninteresting because some tools go beyond essay mills or contract cheating to provide \ntechnical tools and services, and the distinction between research, outlining, co- \nwriting and other functions is blurred. E1ectively, familiar tools like spelling or \ngrammar checkers expand to the substance of the work being undertaken. Drawing a \nline between form and substance is an ongoing task and remains unclear. Some \nregimes delegate that boundary management to the educational institutions, others \nto the legal system.\nOn top of this, enforcement regimes di1er. The majority of regimes only allow prose -\ncution by a normal prosecuting body such as a state attorney, or the CPS, although some \nregimes give some prosecution or investigative ability to regulators, or referral ability to \ninstitutions. The law in these areas may be understood as more symbolic than coming \nwith the rigorous expectation of enforcement. However, making something a criminal \no1ence interacts with other regimes, particularly online. In particular, it interacts with \n(1) the terms of service of general-purpose AI APIs; (2) the contractual licenses attached \nto ‘open-source’ models, such as the OpenRAIL licenses; and (3) obligations placed on \nplatforms under laws such as the OSA and DSA, among others. These may prove to be \nan impactful set of interactions, even without direct enforcement.\nDiscussion\nIn a wider context, we will brie6y discuss issues of attaching responsibility to tech com -\npanies more generally and o1er a possible explanation for doing so. We will brie6y \nexplore why intermediary liability and recommender systems failed to attract liability \nfor content on their platforms and compare why AI services’ liability for o1ering contract \ncheating on their platforms is di1erent to that factual scenario. This may change the \nassessment of liability under the legal regimes. With these considerations in mind, \nseveral amendments are suggested to existing legal regimes which could make contract \ncheating legislation more e1ective in addressing AI. Because of the di1erences between \nAI and essay mills, limitations remain.\nTakedown requests\nMany of the discussed AI essay mills and advertisements outlined are manifestly illegal in \nmany jurisdictions. Takedown requests can be made by any organisation under most \n304 N. GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nintermediary liability laws. We are unaware of any actors arranging takedown requests as \nthere are in areas like child abuse imagery, and as mentioned, few regimes contain reg -\nulators. As we have indicated, private enforcement and intermediation has underexplored \npotential to enforce these regimes.\nHigher education institutions and their representative bodies are candidates to take \nthis action, as are regulators. Takedown requests might be directed at advertising inter -\nmediaries, social media companies, payment processors, upstream AI providers or \nother online organisations. Higher education institutions could share funding to organise \nindividuals to monitor advertising archives and other services for essay mills, and report \nthese to prosecutors as well as issue take down requests. Reporting should be wide, \nincluding to payment service providers, who may be able to stop money-6ows, and to \nAI service providers.\nInternalisation of responsibility\nPolicy discussions around the responsibility of technology companies necessitate deter -\nmining what we base responsibility on, and what level of control, awareness and \nagency we link to liability. For long periods, intermediaries like search engines broadly \nescaped liability for activities which they may have had technical control to curtail or \nmonitor.\n153\nThat norm has been changing in recent years, both in the case law relating \nto existing bodies of law, as well as in new legislative proposals and statutes.\n154\nGeneral-purpose AI services may not qualify as intermediaries under existing regimes \nsuch as the DSA.\n155\nThey may not beneﬁt from immunities, but also will not be subject to \nnew proactive obligations, as other intermediaries have been. Despite this, scholars have \nnoted the importance of misuse monitoring obligations to the governance of AI-as-a- \nservice more generally.\n156\nTrends in law towards enforcing terms and conditions seem \nlike they will be of importance, especially as the governance of AI through private law, \nsuch as licensing and contractual obligations, is becoming a main pillar of global govern -\nance.\n157\nInsofar as essay mills operate illegally, they are likely in breach of standard API \nterms of service and model licensing.\nHowever, the e1ectiveness of this as a governance mechanism is questionable. \nAs essay mills already operate in the shadows, and operate illegally, they \nwill be di-cult to ﬁnd and drag to court for misuse of model IP out of step with the \nterms speciﬁed in the license – although their access to APIs may be more easily cut o1.\nJurisdictions should explore creating obligations for AI providers to enforce their terms \nand conditions, similar to obligations placed on intermediaries under the DSA and OSA. \n153\nSee generally Lilian Edwards, ‘“With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility?”: The Rise of Platform Liability’ in Lilian \nEdwards (ed), Law, Policy, and the Internet (Hart Publishing 2019); Uta Kohl, ‘Google: The Rise and Rise of Online Inter -\nmediaries in the Governance of the Internet and beyond (Part 2)’ (2013) 21 International Journal of Law and Information \nTechnology 187.\n154\nDaithí Mac Síthigh, ‘The Road to Responsibilities: New Attitudes Towards Internet Intermediaries’ (2020) 29 Information \n& Communications Technology Law 1.\n155\nPhilipp Hacker, Andreas Engel and Marco Mauer, ‘Regulating ChatGPT and Other Large Generative AI Models’, Proceed -\nings of the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (Association for Computing Machinery \n2023) < https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594067 > accessed 14 June 2023.\n156\nSeyyed Ahmad Javadi and others, ‘Monitoring Misuse for Accountable “Artiﬁcial Intelligence as a Service”’, Proceedings \nof the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (Association for Computing Machinery 2020) < https://doi.org/10. \n1145/3375627.3375873 > accessed 29 August 2022.\n157\nVeale and others (n 140).\nINFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW 305\nThis would create an avenue to cut o1 professionalised essay mills once services are \nnotiﬁed or investigated.\nClariﬁcation and enforcement\nThe blurred lines we have highlighted between legal and illegal services under academic \ncheating laws are unlikely to get much clariﬁcation from a court due to the limited number \nof prosecutions being brought. Determination of illegality in practice is likely to be left primar -\nily to platform companies to determine, with limited clarity and accountability. This is far from \nideal. It is even less ideal because such platforms themselves would not support a broad \nreading of a law which could capture AI services they themselves o,er . There is a signiﬁcant \nmoral hazard in allowing a platform to deﬁne the scope of regulation in practice, where \nthat regulation may if deﬁned broadly, encompass their own ﬁrms’ products.\nThere must be avenues for judicial clariﬁcation of these rules or further statutory elab -\noration by regulators. Amending the laws to give regulators explicit powers to both pro -\nsecute and provide guidelines on the changing and uncertain boundaries is the ﬁrst step. \nAustralia and New Zealand are the furthest ahead in this regard. England and Wales have \nno statutory body that can take on this role, and without the QAA only the O-ce for \nStudents is available to potentially, voluntarily, take up this role.\nJurisdictions should create or empower regulators, or as a second resort, empower \nhigher education institutions to refer cases to prosecutors. They should issue guidelines \non the interaction between essay mill law and AI to all relevant bodies. Finally, more reg -\nulators create the potential for an international regulatory forum, for coalescing around \nstandards, joint investigations across borders and shared enforcement and capacity on \ncross-border cases. This might be modelled after the European Data Protection Board \nor similar organisations.\nHow to earn a safe harbour?\nEssay mills and contract cheating are companies whose sole purpose is to facilitate aca -\ndemic cheating. The legislation addressing such services works because it targets services \nthat only fulﬁl that purpose. General-purpose AI providers are di1erent. They fulﬁl mul -\ntiple purposes and have not been designed to facilitate academic misconduct. It is there -\nfore questionable, whether it is desirable to criminalise the acts of a service that only \ninadvertently facilitates academic cheating. The strict liability approach of many jurisdic -\ntions, like Australia, is appropriate for purpose-speciﬁc essay mills and contract cheating. It \nis less so for AI services.\nIn many jurisdictions analysed in this policy paper, the legislation around essay mills \nand contract cheating is largely not enforced. The symbolic element of legal regimes \nwas successful because it targeted a speciﬁc industry and made a strong public policy \nstatement against such services. Liability of general-purpose AI services will not deter stu -\ndents from using AI for academic cheating, because AI services are unlikely to be treated \nas criminal entities like essay mills. If anything, governments are eager to court these enti -\nties, hoping – often with little evidence – for national investment and economic prosper -\nity related to facilitating their services.\n306 N. GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nHowever, drawing the line is di-cult. Adding intent or knowledge requirements allows \nbone ﬁde essay mills to 6ourish – hence their removal in recent laws, such as those in \nEngland and Wales. In those cases, it may be worth considering whether certain due dili -\ngence requirements on general-purpose AI services could exempt them from consider -\nation as essay mills, and the liability that may result. Essay mills would be unlikely to \ncooperate in this manner, and so this could e1ectively draw a line between the services. \nThis could include technologies and obligations such as the following:\nIntegration of watermarking\nWatermarking is a technique designed to place a di-cult-to-remove signal, such as a stat -\nistical pattern in the frequency of words, within generated content to indicate its artiﬁci -\nality. Good watermarks are easy to detect but di-cult to remove, and indeed may be \nneeded for ‘AI detection’ tools to function at all on text, given current failures and \nbiases (e.g. against non-native speakers) in this space.\n158\nWatermarks do not prevent all \nissues, particularly for cognitive oEoading, or were students to signiﬁcantly rephrase. \nWhile watermarking is welcome, care should be taken that it does not create proprietary \npower for detection companies like Turnitin or Copyleaks. Furthermore, as we have \nshown, detection tools are often even built into the latest array of AI-powered essay \nmills, so legislation may be required to ensure such tools are only provided to bone \nﬁde institutions.\nDetection and retention of essay querying\nWhile more hands-on, there may be a possibility for collaboration between AI providers, \neducational institutions, and plagiarism checkers. Providing examination questions \nsecurely to AI providers through a consortium may allow them to retain the result of \nqueries that relate to those questions on their servers for a certain limited time. Those \nmaterials could in turn be securely queried by educational institutions, running their sub -\nmitted assignments through them, and retrieving results if any similar content was \ndetected. Firms already retain data on queries for certain of their services. OpenAI \nretains query and response data to chatGPT , although claims not to retain data for the \nsame models queried professionally through its API, as essay mills relying on it will \nlikely use. Such arrangements will be intricate but may be worth exploring. Given that \nthe queries would remain on the AI ﬁrms’ servers, this would also frustrate students’ abil -\nities to run their text through commercial plagiarism detectors to understand usage. \nHowever, it may place a signiﬁcant infrastructural burden on AI providers, and this may \nrequire statutory intervention to incentivise.\nDue diligence and cooperation\nAI service providers could be obliged to provide practical assistance with enforcement. \nFor example, when an AI essay mill is discovered by a regulator, they may wish to \nenter an example question and put AI providers on notice to monitor their servers for \nthis question, so they can understand which model(s) are behind the intermediary, and \ninform them so they can disable the relevant account(s). This comes with potential \n158\nWeixin Liang and others, ‘GPT Detectors Are Biased against Non-Native English Writers’ (arXiv, 18 April 2023) < http:// \narxiv.org/abs/2304.02819 > accessed 6 July 2023.\nINFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW 307\ndata retention and protection challenges, but these do not seem insurmountable, particu -\nlarly if co-operation is sought with sectors facing related challenges.\nChallenges of open-source models\nA challenge with all these concerns relates to open-source models, many of which can \nalready generate text very capable of breaching academic integrity. The above provisions \nassume an AI essay mill is querying a service live, through an API, and can then be mon -\nitored and cut-o1. Where models are uploaded and run on local or third-party hardware, \nmonitoring becomes much more di-cult. While models can be run locally on users’ own \ncomputers, as it stands, the most powerful models require powerful graphical processing \nunits (GPUs) which are not economical to own for occasional use. While API providers can \nin principle monitor and intercept queries before they are transmitted to their models, \ngeneric cloud providers will ﬁnd it more di-cult and much more invasive and risky-to- \nsecurity to intercept such queries from within a virtual machine, as they will likely be \nencrypted in transit and e1ectively require the provider to compromise their clients’ \ncode. Detecting the systems used by apps or website will also be tricky, because students’ \ndevices might query them indirectly through apps or websites, masking the IP address of \nthe cloud hosting service. Because of this, more sophisticated essay mills may adopt the \nstrategy of hosting their own models to limit their potential to be shut down and/or inter -\nrupted. It further seems likely that if AI-facilitated crime is to increase, out-of-jurisdiction \ndatacentres and computational facilities will operate in countries with limited interest in \ncooperation, extradition or the execution of warrants, such as Russia.\nConcluding remarks\nLegal tensions around AI-facilitated academic cheating illustrate crucial insights into the \nintricacies of holding technology companies liable through legal frameworks not \nintended for novel technologies. This discussion is also part of a larger conversation \naround imposing liability on corporate actors. Academic integrity is crucial for successful \nhigher education institutions. AI – perhaps even more so than essay mills – throws into \ndoubt both our original conceptions of academic integrity and our ability to combat \nillegal services.\nEssay mills are increasingly turning to AI systems and selling tools directly to students. \nWhile these are likely covered by existing law, they also stress it, blurring the lines \nbetween digital support tools and the completion of an assignment further. Enforcement \nagainst essay mills using these tools will require cooperation with AI providers, and the \nlack of regulators or associated powers currently scuppers this. Instead, the wide crimina -\nlisation of essay mills risks delegating this law to private enforcement, including by AI pro -\nviders themselves, who are unlikely to deﬁne the scope of these laws widely to avoid \nbeing implicated themselves. The regulation speciﬁcally shaping the private enforcement \nof AI-as-a-service ﬁrms is likely to be needed to limit misuse in this sector and beyond. \nHowever, not all enforcement should be delegated – there remains an important role \nfor regulators here, yet few jurisdictions have named them or given them appropriate \npowers to enforce these laws.\n308 N. GAUMANN AND M. VEALE\nLegislation should be amended to give general-purpose AI systems safe harbour from \ncriminal consideration as an essay mill, insofar as they meet a series of criteria designed to \nlower their risk in this regard. We propose watermarking, regulatory co-operation, and \ntime-limited data retention and querying capacity based on queries provided by edu -\ncational institutions, as mechanisms to consider.\nIn sum, essay mill and contract cheating law is not a good way to regulate general- \npurpose AI systems, but as it stands, it is regulating them, at least in some jurisdictions, \nand on paper. Australia and England and Wales stand out most in this regard. Legislation \nin all jurisdictions needs updating to draw clearer boundaries, provide capacity for \nongoing navigation and negotiation and support real, rather than symbolic, enforcement. \nConsideration should be given to how to exempt general-purpose AI providers from these \nregimes while obliging them to cooperate and mitigate the damage to academic integrity \nthat their tools are facilitating. Safe harbours may be one way to achieve this.\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential con6ict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nFunding\nThis work is supported by the UKRI [grant number EP/V00784X/1] ( https://tas.ac.uk ) Trustworthy \nAutonomous Systems Hub, and the UCL ChangeMakers fund.\nINFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW 309",
