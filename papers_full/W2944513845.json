    "abstract": "Winding overheating is a common fault in a transformer. To detect the temperature, the most widely used method is a point-type measurement, but traditional measurement methods cannot obtain the whole temperature distribution in a transformer. Taking this into consideration, a new method with which to measure the temperature of transformer windings was proposed. Based on Raman scattering, a new fibre-optic composite winding model was developed. The feasibility of the model was verified by electrical as well as temperature, field simulation and power frequency resistance testing. To assess the practicality and accuracy of the new model, a distributed optical fibre temperature measurement platform was built, and a series of experiments were designed. According to the data collected, the temperature measurement error based on the method could be limited to 1 °C while the positioning accuracy error was within 1 m, which meant that the new approach can satisfy the requirements of transformer winding temperature measurement and locate hot spots in the winding.",
