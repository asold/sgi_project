BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12863-020-00941-4\nBackground\nIn the last few decades, the Mediterranean fruit flyCera-\ntitis capitata (Tephritidae, Medfly) has become a major\ninvasive agricultural pest worldwide, following its spread\nfrom Africa and its globalization [1]. For the local sup-\npression of this invasive species, alternatives to the use\nof pesticides are genetic control strategies. One of them\nis the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), which has been ap-\nplied successfully over the last six decades in various\ncountries [2].\nThe prerequisites of SIT include a method to mass\nrear the target species in a cost-effective way and a\nmethod to sterilize them with a low impact on their fit-\nness once released. As the released sterile females con-\ntribute to the fruit crop mechanical damage with the\novipositor and consequent infections, and the sterile\nmales tend to mate with the released females rather than\nwith the wild ones, it is highly preferable to develop a\nmethod of sexing and only release sterile males [3]. A\nnumber of strategies have been developed, including\ntransgenic approaches for sexing, which allow the mass\nrearing of the two sexes, and sorting the males at the ex-\npanded last generation before the release. These strains\ncan be based on the expression of a conditional female-\nlethal dominant gene [4] or on the transformation of\ngenotypic female individuals into males by manipulating\na gene involved in female sex determination [5]. Molecu-\nlar genetics studies on Medfly sex determination have\nbeen useful for this aim, uncovering a cascade of regula-\ntory genes widely conserved in the Tephritidae family\n(Fig. 1)[ 6–10]. This taxon includes many other invasive\nagricultural pests, such as species of theBactrocera and\nAnastrepha genera [11, 12]. This fundamental know-\nledge is not only interesting and valuable per se [13], but\nalso useful to develop novel sexing strategies necessary\nto improve the applicability of SIT. Evolutionary conser-\nvation of homologous genes and the use of transgenesis\nand/or CRISPR/Cas9 potentially will enable the\nrealization of additional versatile sexing methods that\ncan be applied in different species [8, 9, 14–16].\nThe sex determination of Medfly is based, as inDros-\nophila melanogaster, on sex-specific alternative splicing\nFig. 1Genetic pathway of sex determination inCeratitis capitata. Cctra and Ccdoublesex (Ccdsx) pre-mRNAs exon-intron structures and sex-\nspecific transcripts are shown. Female-specific and male-specificCctra exons are indicated as pink and dark blue boxes, respectively.Cctra female-\nspecific transcript on the left contains a 429 aa long ORF.Cctra male-specific exons introduce premature stop codons in male-specific longer\ntranscripts (orange vertical bars). CcTRA M1 and M2 male-specific isoforms contain truncated CcTRA ORFs represented by azul regions. In XX\nembryos, maternal CcTRA (orange circle) and CcTRA-2 (green circle) proteins promote female-specific splicing of newly transcribedCctra pre-\nmRNA, suppressing male-specific splicing by binding to TRA/TRA-2cis regulatory elements (red spots). Female-specificCctra mRNA encodes\nzygotic CcTRA (violet circle) that maintains (together with zygotic CcTRA-2; dark green circle) theCctra autoregulation induced by the maternal\ncontributions by a feedback loop. Both CcTRA and CcTRA-2 proteins promote also female-specific splicing of the downstreamCcdsx pre-mRNA,\nproducing mRNAs that include a female-specific exon (pink) and encode CcDSXF isoform inducing female sexual differentiation [6]. In XY\nembryos the Y-linkedMaleness-on-the-Y gene (MoY) induces male-specificCctra splicing and, hence, the collapse of the positive feedback loop\n[7]. By default, male-specific splicing ofCcdsx leads to male-specific splicing and CcDSM isoform inducing male sexual differentiation [6, 8]\nPrimo et al. BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150 Page 2 of 11\nof key regulatory genes, including transformer (tra),\ntransformer-2 (tra-2) and doublesex (dsx) orthologues\n(Fig. 1)[ 6, 7, 17–20]. Cctra is a sex determining genetic\nswitch, which is set to ON in XX embryos and to OFF\nin XY embryos during a narrow temporal window at 5–\n6 h from oviposition [8]. In contrast to Drosophila,i n\nXX Medfly embryos,Cctra and the auxiliaryCctransfor-\nmer-2 (Cctra-2) maternal mRNAs are also required to\nestablish a stable activation of Cctra by female-specific\nsplicing which relies on a positive feedback loop [6, 19].\nThe female-specific Cctra mRNA encodes a full-length\n429 aa protein arising from the translation of an evolu-\ntionarily conserved ORF contained in the first, fourth\nand fifth exons (Fig.1). In males, two longer alternative\nCctra RNA isoforms, containing all five exons, encode\nfor two truncated CcTRA proteins called CcTRA M1\n(59 aa) and CcTRA M2 (99 aa) (Fig.1). Embryonic tran-\nsient RNA interference targeting mRNAs of either genes\nled to XX males, which are fertile even in the absence of\nthe Y chromosome [6, 19]. As inDrosophila, Cctra and\nCctra-2 are required for the female-specific splicing of\nCcdoublesex (Ccdsx). The observation that some XX in-\ndividuals are transformed in gynandromorphs (showing\nmale-specific antennae and ovipositor or no antennae\nand male gonads) suggests that sex determination is\ncell-autonomous, as in Drosophila [6]. A TRA/TRA-2\nbinding element (13 nt long) is present in multiple copies\nin the Ccdsx female-specific exon, permitting a positive\nregulation by CcTRA/CcTRA-2, which leads to the use of\nthis exon inCcdsx transcripts of XX individuals, similarly\nto Drosophila [7, 18]. In contrast toDrosophila\n, multiple\ncopies of this splicing regulatory element are also present\nin Cctra locus, within and in proximity to the male-\nspecific exons. In this other novel case, these cis elements\nmediate, by CcTRA/CcTRA-2 binding, exon skipping in\nXX individuals leading to CcTRA-encoding female-\nspecific mRNAs [6]. In XY embryos, Maleness-on-the-Y\n(MoY) encodes a novel short protein, MOY, of still un-\nknown biochemical function, that leads, either directly or\nindirectly, to male-specific splicing ofCctra and exons in-\nclusion, at 5–6 h from oviposition [8]. The presence of\nmale-specific exons introducing stop codons in the 429 aa\nlong Cctra ORF leads to two major RNAs encoding trun-\ncated polypeptides (respectively 59 and 99 aa long) and\nhence considered to be non-functional [6].\nWe planned to experimentally confirm this deduction,\nby Cas9-induced mutations in theCctra, which would im-\npact both the male- and female-specific ORFs. Further-\nmore, the availability of an efficient single RNA to induce\nmutations in a female-determining gene would open the\nfuture possibility to develop a gene drive strategy aimed at\nmanipulating the sex ratio and hence the reproduction\nrate of this harmful species [4]. CRISPR/Cas9 has been\nused in the Medfly genome to target autosomal genes\nhaving two copies for each cell [16, 21, 22]. After targeting\nthe white eyeMedfly gene by injecting into early embryos\nin vitro pre-assembled and solubilized Cas9 ribonucleo-\nprotein complexes (RNPs), containing sgRNA, adults\nshowed partial mutant phenotypes caused by somatic mo-\nsaicism [16]. The most extreme mutant phenotype con-\nsisted of a fly mosaic with one of the two eyes fully\ncolorless. While biallelic mutations were observed only in\nsomatic clones of the fly, the germ line transmission rate\nwas very high, reaching 100% in one case. On the con-\ntrary, targeting a Medfly single copy gene, as the Y-linked\nMoY, in XY individuals by Cas9 ribonucleoproteins injec-\ntions, 70% of mutant G\n0 individuals showed intersexual\nphenotype and 30% were transformed into XY mutant G0\nfemales [8].\nWe reasoned that introducing loss-of-function frame-\nshift mutations in the first Cctra exon with CRISPR/\nCas9 would lead to mutant alleles coding for truncated\nCcTRA proteins. The expected truncations would affect\nnot only the 429 aa long female-specific ORF, but also\nthe carboxy-terminal ends of two male-specific 59 and\n99 aa ORFs. A masculinization of XX individuals by per-\nmanent loss-of-function mutations ofCctra altering also\nthe male-specific CcTRA polypeptides would support\nthe previous suggestion that these products are indeed\nnon-functional.\nSince inDrosophila traand tra-2 mutant alleles are re-\ncessive, we reasoned that also in the Medfly the presence\nin the same cell and in its clonal descendants of only\nmonoallelic indel (insertion/deletion) mutations inCctra\n(+/− heterozygous state) would be insufficient to\nmasculinize XX cells. Thus, in the somatic mutant\nclones of these XX individuals, the CcTRA protein\nexpressed from the wild-type allele would lead to\nfemale-specific splicing of Cctra pre-mRNAs from both\nwild-type and mutant alleles, leading to female sexual\nphenotype. Hence, only biallelic loss-of-function Cctra\nmutations (Fig. 2; Cctra\n1−/Cctra2−) in the same XX cell\nand its cellular descendants would lead to a male-\nspecific Cctra and the downstreamCcdsx RNAs, causing\na partial (mosaicism) or full (very early and high bi-\nallelic mutagenesis) masculinization of XX adults.\nResults\nCas9-RNP injections targetingCctra lead to fully\nmasculinized XX flies in the G0 progeny\nWith the aim of inducing indels leading to frameshift\nmutations in Cctra, we used Cas9 RNPs injections as a\ndelivery method. In particular, a CRISPR/Cas9Cctra tar-\nget site was chosen within the coding region of exon 1\non the antisense strand to design a single guide RNA,\nnamed sgtraEx1 (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A). The tar-\ngeted 20 bp long sequence is about 20 bp upstream of\nthe first donor splicing site and upstream to the female-\nPrimo et al. BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150 Page 3 of 11\nspecific long open reading frame encoding the CcTRA\nprotein (Additional file1: Fig. S1B). As described above,\nprevious literature data showed that Cas9 RNPs applied\nto Medfly embryos led to a relatively low somatic bialle-\nlic mutation rate overall but a high rate in the germ line\n[16]. Based on this study, we speculated to observe\nmasculinization of XX Cctra mutant individuals only at\nG\n1 after crossing G0 XY males and G0 XX females devel-\noped from Cas9-injected. However, the discrimination of\nrare Cctra1−/Cctra2− heteroallelic mutant XX males\namong the 50% of the G1 progeny being XY males would\nhave been tedious and challenging. We simplified their\nidentification by planning to detect them among a G1\nfemale-only XX progeny, obtained crossing XX males and\nfemales obtained from RNP-injected embryos (Fig. 2).\nAmong these G\n1 XX females, Cctra-1−/Cctra2− XX males\nwould be easily detected even if very few, with the respect\nof the majority of XX females carrying either none or only\none Cctra mutant allele (Fig.2).\nTo produce a larger number of XX males (Fig.2,s e t1 ) ,\nfrom Cas9-injected XX embryos, a mix of Cas9-sgtraEx1\nRNP andCctra dsRNA, to efficiently masculinize XX, was\ninjected into 370 XX embryos (Table1, set n. 1). The aim\nwas to obtain XX fertile males potentially carrying Cas9-\ninduced Cctra monoallelic mutations also in the germ line.\nHowever, no pupae and adult flies emerged from this set of\ninjections. When Cas9-sgtraEx1 RNP alone targetingCctra\nwere delivered into 400 XX embryos, few adults developed\n(3%; 12/400) (Table1, set n. 2). It is likely that the co-\npresence of dsRNA+Cas9/sgRNA molecules could have a\ncombined higher lethal effect for unclear reasons. Injections\nof dsRNA-Cctra alone resulted in 78 adults out of 200 XX\nembryos injected, with 73 XX being masculinized individ-\nuals and 5 being intersexes (Table1,s e tn .3 ) .As i m i l a rs u r -\nvival rate was obtained when we injected sgtraEx1 RNA\nmolecules but no effect (1μg/μL), at a 5 times higher con-\ncentration being more susceptible to RNA degradation (70\nfemales out of 160 injected embryos; Table1, set n. 4).\nAlthough upon Cas9-sgtraEx1 RNP injections we ob-\nserved a very limited survival rate, the XX adults dis-\nplayed some interesting features (Table 1, set n. 2).\nIndeed, the G\n0 progeny was composed not only of six\nunaffected females, as we expected (Fig.2 set 2), but also\nsix XX males. These findings are suggestive of an un-\nusually high rate of biallelic mutations. It is also worth\nnoting that no intersexes were observed, suggesting an\nall-or-none effect on Cctra female-specific function of\nthe Cas9 + sgtraEx1 injection.\nConsidering the apparently high efficiency of the ribo-\nnucleoprotein injections in set n. 2 (Table1) in mascu-\nlinizing 50% of the G\n0 XX individuals, we reasoned that\n1) also the XX females contained at least some somatic\nFig. 2Experimental design to produce G1 XX males bearing heteroallelic mutation ofCctra. Two sets of parallel Cas9-RNP injections to target\nCctra into XX embryos can lead to both G0 XX males and XX females. The G0 adults from the two sets can bear someCctra monoallelic\nindependent mutations (mosaicism) both in the soma and in the germ line. In set n. 1, the injection mix contains alsoCctra-dsRNA to induce full\nmasculinization of XX embryos (Pane et al., 2002). Hence, the G0 XX males from set n. 1 can be crossed with G0 XX females from set n. 2, to\nproduce a G1 XX progeny, expected to be composed mostly of XX females (carrying either none or monoallelic mutations) and of few G1 XX\nmales, carrying heteroallelic mutations ofCctra (Cctra1−/Cctra2−) inherited from the respective parents\nPrimo et al. BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150 Page 4 of 11\nclones bearing monoallelicCctra mutations, though with\nno phenotypic effect, and that 2) a high mutagenic rate\ncould also be present in the germ lines of these XX fe-\nmale adults as in the XX males. Assuming a 20–50%\ntransmission rate of mutant alleles for each G\n0 parent to\nthe next progeny as previously observed in the Medfly\n[16], the probability to observe a double mutant individ-\nual in the G1 progeny (Fig. 2) would be in a range of 4–\n25%. When we crossed among them the six XX males\nand six XX females from injection set n. 2 (Table1), all\n100 individuals of G1 were females, indicating that the\nsix XX masculinized fathers were fertile. However, the\nabsence of XX males in the G1 progeny indicated that, if\nany Cctra mutation was induced by Cas9 in the parental\ngerm lines (male and female ones), the transmission rate\nwas lower than 10% for each parent as the expected G1\nheteroallelic mutants frequency would be less than 1% of\nthe progeny (hence not detectable among a number of\n100 individuals).\nLack of indels in the targetedCctra region in most cDNA\nclones from XX G0 males and in all genomic DNA clones\nfrom G0 XX females\nThe six females and six XX males, which composed the\nG0 progeny of set n. 2, were analyzed respectively by\nRT-PCR and genomic PCR, to investigateCctra splicing\nand DNA sequence of the targeted site.\nThe six reverted XX G 0 males showed only male-\nspecific Cctra transcripts, as expected for adult flies hav-\ning a full fertile male phenotype (Fig.3). These data, to-\ngether with the absence of female-specificCctra mRNAs\nin all six males, suggested the presence of biallelic muta-\ntions in most, if not all, of the somatic cells of these XX\nG\n0 males. Shotgun plasmid cloning of the RT-PCR reac-\ntions from the six XX G0 males, followed by PCR colony\nscreening of 30 clones (five colonies A-E, for each of the\nsix XX males) led us to arbitrarily select 13 clones for se-\nquencing (two or three cDNA clones for each male)\n(Additional file 1: Figure S2 and Figure S3)(Add-\nitional file 2). The splicing isoforms detected in the six\nXX males corresponded mostly to the know M1 and M2\nCctra male-specific isoforms. Out of 13 cDNA clones\nfrom the six XX males, seven correspond to male-\nspecific Cctra isoform M1 (59 aa), two correspond to\nthe male-specific isoform M2 (99 aa), one to a new spli-\ncing male-specific isoform (Male 1D encoding a 44 aa\nlong protein isoform, named M3), one to the female-\nspecific isoform (429 aa) and one to an unspliced longer\nisoform (male 5C) (Additional file 1: Figure S3; Add-\nitional file 2)[ 6]. Very surprisingly, despite the observed\nCctra male-specific full shift, 11 cDNA clones showed\nTable 1XX-only embryonic injection sets\nInjection\nset\nCas9 delivery / [] sgRNA name / [] dsRNA name / [] XX\nembryos\nXX\nLarvae\nXX\nFemales\nXX\nMales\nXX\nintersexes\nCctra male-\nspecific in XX\n1 Cas9 Protein /\n1,8 μg/μL\nsgtraEx1 /\n200 ng/μL\ndsRNA-Cctra /\n0.5 μg/μL\n370 48 0 0 0 –\n2 Cas9 Protein /\n1,8 μg/μL\nsgtraEx1 /\n200 ng/μL\n– 400 60 6 6 0 yes in XX males\n3 –– dsRNA-Cctra /\n0.5 μg/μL\n200 83 0 73 5 –\n4 – sgtraEx1 /\n1 μg/μL\n– 160 75 70 0 0 no\n5 Plasmid-dCas9 /\n1 μg/μL\nsgtraEx1 /\n1 μg/μL\n– 290 37 7 0 3 yes\n6 Cas9 Protein /\n1,8 μg/μL\nsgtraEx1 /\n200 ng/μL\n– 40 –– – – yes\n7 Plasmid-Cas9 /\n1 μg/μL\nsgtraEx1 /\n1 μg/μL\n– 40 –– – – yes\n8 Plasmid-dCas9 /\n1 μg/μL\nsgtraEx1 /\n1 μg/μL\n– 40 –– – – yes\n9 buffer buffer buffer 40 –– – – no\n10 – sgtraEx1 /\n1 μg/μL\n– 40 –– – – no\n11 Cas9 Protein /\n1,8 μg/μL\n–– 40 –– – – no\n12 Plasmid-Cas9 /\n1 μg/μL\n–– 40 –– – – no\n13 Plasmid-dCas9 /\n1 μg/μL\n–– 40 –– – – no\nPrimo et al. BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150 Page 5 of 11\nonly wild-type sequences (Additional file 1: Figure S3).\nIn one XX male, we have found a cDNA showing a 16\nbp long deletion (cDNA 3E), in addition to a wild type\ncDNA clone (cDNA 3B) (Additional file1: Figure S1D).\nThe mutated cDNA encodes a 35 aa long CcTRA trun-\ncated protein. Another XX male contained two wild type\n(5B and 5D) cDNA clones and a mutated one lacking of\n5 bp (5C) (Additional file 1: Figure S1C). This cDNA\nMale 5C encoded a truncated CcTRA protein of only 42\naa (Additional file 1: Figure S1C). The male 5C cDNA\nfrom unspliced Cctra RNA seems to correspond to a\npreviously described RNA only present in adult females\n[6]. The female specificity of this unspliced product\ncould be due to the binding of female-specific CcTRA/\nCcTRA-2 complex to theCctra pre-mRNA required for\nthe autoregulation. Interestingly, theCctra unspliced iso-\nform we found in one XX male contains also the Cas9-\ninduced 5 bp deletion. We speculated that the 5 bp long\ndeleted region of Cctra could be involved in enhancing\nthe recognition of the 5′ donor site, which is only 20 bp\ndownstream to the deletion by the spliceosome. We\nhave found that these 5 bp are perfectly conserved in\nother Tephritidae tra orthologues, suggesting their re-\nquirement for properCctra male-specific default splicing\n(Additional file 1: Figure S1E). On the other hand, the\ncDNA 3E containing even a larger deletion (16 bp) of\nthe same Cctra region performed a male-specific spli-\ncing, indicating that this sequence (14 bp out of 20 bp\ntargeted sequence conserved in 5 distantly related\nTephritidae species; Additional file1: Figure S1E) is not\nstrictly required to perform this alternative splicing but\ncould be involved in performing the female-specific one.\nCollectively, these data showed intriguingly that the six\nXX males had a full switch from female-specific to male-\nspecific splicing ofCctra, even in the presence of a very\nlow (hence, mostly monoallelic) or even zero number of\nmutant Cctra alleles.\nAs the six XX females showed a normal female pheno-\ntype, female-specific Cctra splicing was expected to be\nfound, even if they were carrying monoallelicCctra muta-\ntions (Fig. 2). Hence, Cctra genomic DNA (rather than\nRNA or cDNA) was analyzed and eight plasmid clones\nshowed onlyCctra wild-type sequences (Additional file1:\nFigure S4; Additional file3). The lack ofCctra mutations\nin the DNA clones from all six G\n0 females and in most of\nthe cDNA from the six XX males is consistent with the\nabsence of XX mutant heteroallelic Cctra− 1/Cctra− 2\nmales we observed in their G1 progeny.\nEmbryos co-injections of dCas9 and sgtraEx1 lead to\npartially masculinized XX embryos and adult flies,\nindicating a long-lasting effect in the absence of\nmutations\nWe speculated that this Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex\nwas able to bind but not efficiently cut theCctra DNA\ntarget site. The dead Cas9 (dCas9) is a mutant Cas9\nwhich lacks of only the endonuclease activity and it can\nbe used to perform transient transcriptional repression,\nnamed CRISPR interference, or iCRISPR [23–25]. We\nco-injected the sgRNA sgtraEx1 (1μg/μl) with a plasmid\nbearing a dCas9 transgene under aDrosophila actin pro-\nmoter, expecting that dCas9 would be produced after\nFig. 3RT-PCR analysis of reverted XX males.(A) The six XX males from injection set n. 2 (Table1) showed only male-specificCctra transcripts\n(500 bp) and shorter less abundant splicing variants. No traces of female-specific transcripts were visible in the gel electrophoresis (160 bp)(B) RT-\nPCR with MoY-specific primers indirectly confirmed the absence of the Y chromosome in these six fully reverted XX males and its presence in XY\nflies (positive control)\nPrimo et al. BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150 Page 6 of 11\ntranscription and translation and would bind the avail-\nable sgRNA [24] (Table 1, set n. 5). A higher concentra-\ntion of sgRNA (1μg/μl; see mat. & meth.) was used in\nthe injected mix because we expected that these RNA\nmolecules being not pre-assembled with Cas9 before in-\njections, could have been more exposed to degradation.\nThis high concentration of sgRNA alone had no effect\non Cctra female-specific splicing in injected XX embryos\nand in developed XX adults (Table1, set n. 10; Fig.4,\nB). Three out of ten XX adult females showed malfor-\nmations of the gonadal apparatus, which suggested a\nmild masculinization effect (Additional file 1: Figure\nS5A). RT-PCR analysis of Cctra on RNA from these\nthree XX adult flies confirmed the presence of also\nmale-specific RNAs, indicating that the ovipositor mal-\nformations are likely the result of a partial\nmasculinization during development (Additional file 1:\nFigure S5B). These data indicated that the dCas9 can in-\nduce a partial masculinization of XX embryos and a\nstable shift toward male-specific splicing ofCctra likely\nin some somatic clones.\nWe investigated the sex-specific splicing pattern of\nCctra in XX-only embryos, injected at 1 h after egg laying,\nand developed for additional 14 h (set n. 6–13). Injections\nof Cas9 recombinant protein+sgtraEx1 RNP (set n. 6), or\nco-injections of sgtraEx1 with plasmids encoding either\nCas9 (driven by E1 early promoter [23]) or dCas9 (set n. 7\nand set n. 8) led to the appearance of additional male-\nspecific Cctra transcripts (Table1, Fig. 4A). Injections of\nonly buffer, sgtraEx1, Cas9 protein, Cas9-encoding and\ndCas9-encoding plasmids had no effect (Fig.4B). These\ndata suggest that, as Cas9, also dCas9 can induce male-\nspecific splicing ofCctra during the first hours of develop-\nment. Hence, no Cctra mutations are required for this\nsplicing change.\nDiscussion\nThe Cas9-sgtraEx1 RNPs injected into XX Medfly em-\nbryos led to a masculinization of 50% of XX individuals.\nAll six XX males showed by RT-PCR and cDNA sequen-\ncing analyses mostly male-specific Cctra isoforms, con-\ncordant with the observed male phenotype.\nUnexpectedly, no indel mutations were detected in\ncDNA fragments from the Cas9 targeted site in four out\nof six males. Two XX males showed a mix of wild type\nand mutated cDNA fragments, suggesting the presence\nof monoallelic mutations in some cellular regions. XX\nmales and XX females from injected embryos produced\naG\n1 consisting of only XX females, which indicated ab-\nsence of homozygous individuals for mutant Cctra al-\nleles. We concluded that very low mutation rate, if any,\nwas reached not only in the soma but also in the germ\nline of injected G\n0 individuals. In contrast, Meccariello\net al. [ 16], observed that mutant mosaic G 0 flies\nFig. 4Molecular partial masculinization of XX embryos by dCas9\ntargeting Cctra.

The XX embryos were\ninjected respectively with Cas9 protein+sgtraEx1 (first lane), with\nsgtraEx1 + Cas9-encoding plasmid (pIE1-Cas9; second lane) and with\ndCas9-encoding plasmid (pAct-dCas9) (third lane). Male-specific\nCctra transcripts were detected (500 bp cDNA fragment) in all three\nsamples of injected XX embryos, in addition to the female-specific\ntranscripts (160 bp cDNA fragment). RT-PCR analysis of the Y-linked\nMoY gene indirectly confirmed the absence of Y chromosome in all\n3 samples and in XX females, and its presence in a mixed XX/XY\nembryos sample and in adult XY flies (Panel 2).CcSOD positive\ncontrol is shown in panel 3.(B) Negative controls.

BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150 Page 7 of 11\nmutagenized by Cas9 in thewhite-eye gene transmitted\ngerm line mutations to the progeny at a very high rate\n(up to 100%). Hence, the Cas9-sgtraEx1 is likely very in-\nefficient in mediating Cas9 gene disruption but surpris-\ningly very efficient in masculinizing XX individuals.\nThese data suggested that the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein\npromoted masculinization by inducing male-specific\nCctra splicing in 50% of XX embryos which developed\ninto adults by a mechanism different than gene\ndisruption.\nWe reasoned that the sgRNA designed for the CRISPR\nexperiment and/or the Cctra targeted region structural\nfeatures posed limitations in the second step of the Cas9\naction, namely the endonuclease activity, but not in the\nfirst step, the binding to theCctra genetic locus. Indeed,\na two-state model for Cas9 binding and cleavage was re-\ncently proposed: a seed match triggers binding but only\nextensive pairing with target DNA leads to cleavage [26].\nTarget sequence mismatches can induce the Cas9-RNP\ncomplex to bind also off-target sites without DNA cleav-\nage, because the transition to the active conformation is\nprevented [26, 27]. Co-injections of sgtraEx1 and a plas-\nmid encoding dCas9 into XX embryos induced a partial\nshift of Cctra splicing toward male-specific pattern after\nfew hours of development and the development of XX\nfemales (three out of ten) with malformed ovipositor.\nThese females were found to be molecular intersexes, as\nthey showed both female-specific and male-specific\nCctra isoforms. Also, these malformed females showed a\nmix of male and female-specific Cctra transcripts and,\nhence, correspond to partially masculinized individuals\n(intersexes) [6]. Similar malformed ovipositors were ob-\nserved by Pane et al. [ 6] following embryonic RNA\nagainst Cctra. The lack of fully masculinized XX individ-\nuals in the progeny of ten individuals suggests a reduced\nefficiency of dCas9 in masculinizing XX individuals.\nHowever, this could be due to the different delivery\nmethods of Cas9 and dCas9. In the first case, purified re-\ncombinant Cas9 ready to act was injected, while in the\nsecond case a dCas9 encoding transgene was transcribed\nfrom a Drosophila actin promoter, after embryos injec-\ntions of a plasmid. Lower efficiency is to be expected in\nthe second delivery method, due to the transcription and\ntranslation steps required to express dCas9. The transi-\nent binding of Cas9 RNPs to the 5′ Cctra DNA region\ncould have reduced theCctra zygotic transcription dur-\ning the first hours of embryogenesis and, hence, the ac-\ncumulation of female specifically spliced Cctra mRNA,\npromoted by the maternalCctra contribution in XX em-\nbryos. This transient reduction of newly transcribed\nCctra female-specific mRNA and of the encoded CcTRA\nprotein in the XX embryos could have blocked the es-\ntablishment of Cctra female-specific autoregulation lead-\ning to a negative epigenetic effect onCctra. Similarly, a\ntransient depletion ofCctra mRNA by embryonic RNAi\nled to a collapse of its positive autoregulation and to ob-\ntain XX fertile males expressing male-specific Cctra\nRNAs [6].\nConclusions\nThe question if CcTRA male-specific ORFs are required\nfor male-specific Cctra splicing remains still open, as\nbiallelic Cctra mutant XX males were not obtained. The\nsecond question if the chosen sgtraEx1 guide RNA is\nsuitable for future gene drive strategy aimed to efficient\nmutagenesis by Cas9 had a conclusive and negative\nreply, as very low mutagenesis rate was observed. How-\never, these data support the hypothesis that the transient\nbinding of the Cas9-sgtraEx1 ribonucleoprotein complex\non the firstCctra exon during the first hours of embryo-\ngenesis led to a repression of the establishment of the\nCctra female-specific autoregulation in XX embryos\neven in the absence of induced mutations. Our study\nraises new general issues concerning the use of CRISPR/\nCas9 method. We serendipitously uncovered a novel\nproblem of unplanned stable changes in the expression\nof genes able to autoregulate, which calls for further in-\nvestigation. If a Cas9 + sgRNA binds to off target se-\nquences of autoregulating bistable genes, this event can\nprovoke long lasting epigenetic effects even in the ab-\nsence of DNA mutations.\nMethods\nRearing ofCeratitis capitata\nWild type (WT) and transgenic Medfly lines were main-\ntained under standard rearing conditions. The WT\nBenakeion strain, which has been reared in laboratories\nfor more than 20 years, was obtained from P. A. Mouri-\nkis 30 years ago (Benakeion Institute of Phytopathology,\nAthens, Greece). The strains were reared in standard la-\nboratory conditions at 25 °C, 70% relative humidity and\n12:12 h light–dark regimen. Adult flies were fed yeast/\nsucrose powder (1:2).\nRNP complex assembly and injections\nCas9 was expressed as his-tagged protein and purified\nfrom bacteria [16, 19]. sgRNA was designed using the\nCHOPCHOP online software [ 28]. The lack of SNPs\nwithin this 20 nt long sequence in three differentCerati-\ntis lines (Benakeion, used in this study, ISPRA [22] and\nFAM18 Ceratitis [8]) suggested that no Cas9-resistant\nCctra alleles would be already present in individuals of\nthese lab strains. Template for sgRNA in vitro transcrip-\ntion were generated by annealing two complementary\noligonucleotides (PAGE-purified, Life Technologies) as\npreviously described [ 16, 21], using the primers F-\nsgtraEx1 and Reverse-Crispr from Life Technologies\n(Additional file 4). sgRNA was synthesized according to\nPrimo et al. BMC Genetics2020, 21(Suppl 2):150 Page 8 of 11\ninstructions of the Megascript® T7 kit (Ambion) with\n1 μg of DNA template and a 5′ flanking T7 promoter.\nAfter RNA synthesis, the template was removed by incu-\nbating with TurboDNase® (Ambion) for 15 min at 37°.\nPrior to the injection, the RNP complex was prepared by\nmixing 1.8μg/μL of purified Cas9 protein with approxi-\nmately 200 ng/μL of sgtraEx1, containing 300 mM KCl\n[16]. The mix was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. A glass\nneedle was filled with the pre-loaded sgtraEx1-Cas9 mix\nand the injection was performed into the posterior end\nof embryos collected 45 min after egg laying as described\nfor RNA interference in Ceratitis capitata [6]. When\ninjecting sgRNA alone, a 5 times higher concentration\n(1 μg/μL) was used in the injected mix, because we ex-\npected that these RNA molecules, being not pre-\nassembled with Cas9 before injections, could have been\nmore exposed to degradation.\nRNAi and XX-only progeny production\nA Cctra cDNA 800 bp long fragment was PCR amplified\nusing RNA from female adults ofC. capitata and longer\n164+/900- primers, introducing a T7 promoter sequence\nat each extremity. In vitro transcription ofCctra dsRNA\nwas performed using the Ambion MEGAscript® RNAi\nkit T7 RNA polymerase, following manufacturer instruc-\ntions. Embryonic RNAi (0.5μg/μL dsRNA solution) was\nused to repressCctra in XX/XY embryos and to produce\nmale only progeny. Single males from this progeny were\ncrossed with three females in small cages and the crosses\nhaving XX males were identify by Y-specific PCR (Y-spe-\ncific primers) [8] on a small sample of laid embryos.\ndCas9 encoding plasmid and injections\nPlasmid expressing dCas9 under the control of theDros-\nophila melanogaster actin promoter was kindly provided\nto GS by Lenny Rabinow (Perrimon’s lab, Harvard, USA)\n[23]. A mix containing 1μg/μL of pAct-dCas9 plasmid\nand 1 μg/μL of sgtraEx1 transcribed in vitro into the\nposterior end of embryos. We used 5 times higher con-\ncentration of sgRNA because we expected that these\nsmall RNA molecules being not pre-assembled with\nCas9 before injections, could have been more exposed to\ndegradation.\nRNA extraction and RT-PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from pools of embryos, in-\ntersexes, male and female adults using TRIzol® Re-\nagent (Invitrogen®) following manufacturer\ninstructions. Oligo-dT-primed cDNA was prepared\nfrom DNAse-treated total RNA using EuroScript® m-\nMLV reverse transcriptase (Euroclone®). RT-PCR ex-\npression analysis was performed with the following\nprimers: Cctra 164+/320-, CcSOD+/CcSOD- and\nCcMoY A+/CcMoY A- (Additional file 4). For XX\nmalformed females obtained from XX only embryos\nwith dCas9 and sgtraEx1 Cctra RT-PCR was per-\nformed using Cctra 164+/900- primers pair, annealing\non the same exon as Cctra 320- primer (Additional\nfile 4). Gel electrophoresis diagnostic amplicon run\nwas performed using Marker III (Lambda genomic\nDNA digested with EcoRI/HindIII) or 100 bp ladder\nfrom Thermo Scientific®.\nDNA extraction and molecular analysis\nDNA extraction was performed, with minor modifica-\ntions, according to the protocol of Holmes and Bonner\net al. [29]. Adult XX female flies G\n0 were placed in a 1.5\nml tube and manually crushed with a pestle in 200 ml\nHolmes Bonner buffer (Urea 7 M, 281 Tris-HCl 100 mM\npH 8.0, EDTA 10 mM pH 8.0, NaCl 350 mM, SDS 2%).\nSubsequently, DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform\nextraction, followed by chloroform extraction and etha-\nnol precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in 30 μl\nwater containing RNase A.\ncDNA and gDNA cloning and sequencing\nPCR cDNA fragments from XX adult males were cloned\ninto pGEM-T Easy Promega® vector according manufac-\nturer instruction. PCR colony screening was carried out\nusing 164+ and 320- primers. Positive colonies were\nused to extract plasmid DNA which was sequenced\nusing Applied Biosystem® Big Dye v 3.1.

PP performed PCR, cloning and sequencing analyses of the 6 XX\nmales and 6 XX females from of injection set n. 2 (Table1). PP and GSO\nperformed injection set n. 5 and RT-PCR of the 3 XX malformed females. PP\nand GV performed injection set n. 6– 9 and GV performed RT-PCR analyses\non the 15 h-old injected embryos. PP performed the cross of G\n0 males and\nfemales from set n. 2 and visually screened the G1 progeny. AM, PP, AG, MGI,\nGDC, GSO and GV maintained the Medfly strains, preparing larval and adult\nfood, performing crosses and collecting embryos.
