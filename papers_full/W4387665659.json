While data‑driven methods are commonly utilized for selecting candidate genes, \nknowledge‑driven methods must contend with the challenge of efficiently sifting through extensive volumes of bio‑\nmedical information. This work aimed to assess the utility of large language models (LLMs) for knowledge‑driven \ngene prioritization and selection.\nMethods In this proof of concept, we focused on 11 blood transcriptional modules associated with an Erythroid cells \nsignature. We evaluated four leading LLMs across multiple tasks. Next, we established a workflow leveraging LLMs. The \nsteps consisted of: (1) Selecting one of the 11 modules; (2) Identifying functional convergences among constituent \ngenes using the LLMs; (3) Scoring candidate genes across six criteria capturing the gene’s biological and clinical rel‑\nevance; (4) Prioritizing candidate genes and summarizing justifications; (5) Fact‑checking justifications and identifying \nsupporting references; (6) Selecting a top candidate gene based on validated scoring justifications; and (7) Factoring \nin transcriptome profiling data to finalize the selection of the top candidate gene.\nResults Of the four LLMs evaluated, OpenAI’s GPT‑4 and Anthropic’s Claude demonstrated the best performance \nand were chosen for the implementation of the candidate gene prioritization and selection workflow. This workflow \nwas run in parallel for each of the 11 erythroid cell modules by participants in a data mining workshop. Module M9.2 \nserved as an illustrative use case. The 30 candidate genes forming this module were assessed, and the top five scoring \ngenes were identified as BCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1, and FECH. Researchers carefully fact‑checked the summarized \nscoring justifications, after which the LLMs were prompted to select a top candidate based on this information. GPT‑4 \ninitially chose BCL2L1, while Claude selected ALAS2. When transcriptional profiling data from three reference datasets \nwere provided for additional context, GPT‑4 revised its initial choice to ALAS2, whereas Claude reaffirmed its original \nselection for this module.\nConclusions Taken together, our findings highlight the ability of LLMs to prioritize candidate genes with mini‑\nmal human intervention. This suggests the potential of this technology to boost productivity, especially for tasks \nthat require leveraging extensive biomedical knowledge.\nKeywords Transcriptomics, Erythroid cells, Feature selection, Large language models, Generative artificial intelligence\n†Mohammed Toufiq and Darawan Rinchai contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence:\nDamien Chaussabel\ndamien.chaussabel@jax.org\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 33Toufiq et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \nBackground\nSystems-scale profiling technologies are unbiased, simul -\ntaneously measuring all analytes in a biological system. \nTranscriptomics, for instance, uses RNA-sequencing to \nsimultaneously quantify tens of thousands of RNA species \n[1, 2]. The introduction of such capabilities over two dec -\nades ago was transformational and resulted in significant \nadvances across a wide range of medical fields [3, 4], nota-\nbly in oncology for risk stratification [5, 6] and in autoim-\nmunity to elucidate the pathogenesis of diseases like SLE \n[7, 8]. However, while systems/omics profiling offers tre -\nmendous advantages, there is also a need to identify rel -\nevant analyte panels and design targeted profiling assays.\nTargeted transcriptional profiling assays enable precise, \nquantitative assessments of the abundance of panels com-\nprising tens to hundreds of transcripts [9, 10]. Owing to \ntheir simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and rapid turnaround \ntimes, these assays carry substantial potential for both \nresearch and clinical endeavors. In research scenarios, \ntargeted assays firstly provide the advantage of enabling \nthe processing of large number of samples. This can be \ncritical in studies conducted with large patient cohorts, \nespecially when incorporating a longitudinal component \n[11–13]. Secondly, these streamlined targeted profiling \nassays could also prove more suitable in resource-con -\nstrained research environments, such as in developing \ncountries. Finally, from a translational perspective, tar -\ngeted assays can assist in discovering biomarkers, evalu -\nating drug responses, and monitoring treatments, while \noffering a path towards development and validation of \nnovel diagnostic modalities.\nThe critical task of selecting relevant candidate genes \nfor inclusion in targeted assays can be guided by both \nprior knowledge and analysis of existing omics data. \nAs demonstrated in our previous work, we leveraged a \ncombination of data- and knowledge-driven strategies \nto develop a targeted transcriptional panel for monitor -\ning immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection [14]. \nThis selection process relied on the well-established \nBloodGen3 fixed blood transcriptome repertoire, which \nwe employed as a framework for data-driven identifica -\ntion of candidate gene pools  [17]. By leveraging refer -\nence blood transcriptome datasets from SARS-CoV-2 \ninfected subjects, 23 distinct sets of modules compris -\ning co-expressed genes were identified. To finalize the \nselection of the gene panel from these pools of candi -\ndates, which included 3176 transcripts in total, we used \na knowledge-driven approach. Utilizing functional pro -\nfiling tools, knowledge bases, and expert curation, we \nwere able to prioritize three \"themed\" panels of 23 genes \neach, which were categorized based on their relevance to \nSARS-CoV-2 biology, immunological relevance, or thera-\npeutic relevance.\nEmploying knowledge-driven in addition to data-driven \napproaches, as we have done as part of this prior work, is \nvaluable since it can enhance the interpretability of assay \nresults and provide insights into mechanisms of action and \npotential therapeutic pathways. However, as was also the \ncase in our study, the pools of candidates obtained through \nsystems-scale profiling approaches may include thou -\nsands of genes, representing a large volume of associated \nliterature, making the curation process potentially lengthy \nand possibly lacking in depth. And while resources such \nas gene ontologies and curated pathways can help, they \noften provide only superficial information about the genes \nand may lack context. Recently introduced large language \nmodels (LLMs) hold significant potential for improving \nthe utilization of collective biomedical knowledge, and this \ninnovative approach may offer a more efficient means of \nassimilating and synthesizing the extensive, context-rich \ninformation necessary for effective gene curation and anal-\nysis. Thus, we decided here to explore the use of genera -\ntive LLMs to assist with prioritizing pools of co-expressed \ngenes that form modules of potential clinical and biologi-\ncal relevance—with the development of a generic immune \nprofiling Targeted Fingerprinting Assay (ImmP-TFA) \nas our ultimate goal. We compared the performance of \nGPT-3.5, GPT-4 (from OpenAI), Bard (from Google), and \nClaude (from Anthropic) across various tasks and created \na standardized workflow inclusive of validation checks. We \napplied this workflow to the ongoing prioritization of 11 \nBloodGen3 modules that encompass the module aggregate \nA37. This meta-signature has been correlated with respira-\ntory syncytial virus (RSV) infection severity [15], vaccine \nresponse [16], and elevated abundance of transcripts in \npatients with metastatic melanoma [15]. Our results dem-\nonstrate that LLMs can effectively prioritize large candi -\ndate gene pools for inclusion in targeted biomarker panels \nwith minimal human input. Notably LLMs were also able \nto interpret and  factor in reference transcriptional data \nwhen tasked to pick a top candidate for a given module.\nMethods\nBloodGen3 module repertoire\nThe construction and characterization of the BloodGen3 \nrepertoire has been described in detail previously [17]. \nBriefly, we used as input a collection of 16 reference \ndatasets encompassing 985 unique blood transcrip -\ntome profiles, representing 16 disease and physiological \nstates, including infectious and autoimmune diseases, \npregnancy, transplantation. Co-clustering patterns were \nidentified and served as a basis for the constitution of a \nweighted network, from which densely inter-connected \nnetworks (modules or cliques) were identified. Modules \nwere subsequently grouped into aggregates, based on \npatterns of transcript abundance observed across the 16 \nPage 3 of 33\nToufiq et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \n \ndatasets. It is possible thus to obtain two tiers of dimen -\nsion reduction: at the module (382 variables) or module \naggregate level (38 variables).\nLarge language models\nChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, https:// ope -\nnai. com/).

The \nnumerical and textual outputs generated by the models \nare available in Additional File 1 for module M9.2, which \nserves as our use case.\nSelecting one of the A37 modules (Step 1)\nParticipants to the data mining workshop were first \ntasked to select a module from the set of 11 modules \ncomprised in the BloodGen3 A37 aggregate.\nIdentifying functional convergences among the pool \nof candidate genes (Step 2)\nThe following prompts were designed and input to the \nLLMs via their respective chat interfaces.\nPROMPT 2.1: Could you identify functional conver -\ngences among this set of genes?\n[provide symbols for genes constituting the module].\nPROMPT 2.2: Could you generate a R script to visu -\nalize these relationships as a network, with nodes rep -\nresenting themes and genes, and edges representing \nfunctional associations between genes and themes and \namong genes?\nScoring each candidate gene across multiple criteria (Step 3)\nIn this study, “prompt engineering” played a critical role \nin harnessing the capabilities of LLMs for candidate gene \nprioritization. Here a key aspect of our approach con -\nsisted in requesting LLMs to score on a scale from 0 to \n10 each gene against a series of statements. Those state -\nments were structured around three primary themes: (i) \nRelevance as a biomarker, (ii) Therapeutic relevance, and \n(iii) Biological significance. For benchmarking purposes, \nthemes could be explored through two types of state -\nments—some were explicit and direct (e.g., ’the gene is \nassociated with erythroid cells or erythropoiesis’), while \nothers allowed for inferencing (e.g., ’the gene has poten -\ntial value as a blood transcriptional biomarker’). Each \nstatement was scored independently, obviating the need \nfor a specific order in the prompts. Although we con -\nsidered weighted scoring based on the perceived impor -\ntance of each theme, we opted for equal weighting across \nall themes to align with the translational focus of this \nproject. It is worth noting that the statements were opti -\nmized through several iterations. Some of the statements \nwill also be tailored for specific module aggregates (e.g. \nerythroid relevance in this case, that is more specifically \npertinent for module aggregate A37).\nPROMPT 3.1: I am next going to ask for a given gene \nto:\n1. Provide the gene’s official name\n2. Provide a brief summary of the gene’s function.\n3. Give each of the following statements a score from 0 \nto 10, with 0 indicating no evidence and 10 indicating \nvery strong evidence:\nPage 4 of 33Toufiq et al.

This figure presents our novel workflow for candidate gene prioritization \n(C), within a broader omics data‑driven strategy for developing targeted “transcriptome fingerprinting assays” (TFAs). The first component involves \ndata‑driven construction of a collection of co‑expressed blood transcriptional modules (A). This “fixed transcriptional repertoire” provides a stable \nframework over time for data analysis and interpretation. The BloodGen3 repertoire consists of 382 modules in 38 aggregates representing \n14,168 transcripts, constructed and characterized as described in the Methods and a prior publication [17]. Using BloodGen3 in multiple studies \nprovided insight into the potential biological and clinical relevance of its modular signatures (B). One signature, corresponding to the module \naggregate A37, was associated with circulating erythroid cells, vaccine responses, and respiratory viral infection severity [15, 16], leading to its \nprioritization for inclusion in a generic Immune Profiling TFA panel (ImmP‑TFA). Modules within this aggregate were selected to pilot the novel \nworkflow for the prioritization of candidate gene pools (C). In doing so, we investigated the versatility of large LLMs for a range of tasks, from scoring \ncandidates to the selection of top candidates for more comprehensive characterization in a separate workflow (D) [30, 31]\nPage 7 of 33\nToufiq et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \n \nFig. 1 (See legend on previous page.)\nPage 8 of 33Toufiq et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \nconstructed and characterized [17] (Fig.  1A and see \nmethods for details). Among the 38 module aggregates, \naggregate A37 comprised 11 modules, which expression \nin one of the reference datasets appeared to be restricted \nto CD71 + Glycophorin A + erythroid cells [15]. It was \nchosen to be subjected to candidate gene prioritization \non the basis of its biological significance and potential \nclinical relevance (Fig. 1B): (1) we have shown in our pre-\nvious work this erythroid cell signature to be associated \nwith RSV disease severity [15]; (2) It was also increased \nin patients with late-stage melanoma [15], which is con -\nsistent with reports that have attributed immunomodula-\ntory functions to this cell population [26, 27]; (3) More \nrecently we described pronounced changes in abundance \nfor the transcripts included in this signature following the \nadministration of the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA \nvaccines [16]; and (4) Others have also found erythroid \ncell signatures to be associated with COVID-19 [28] and \npregnancy [29].\nIn the current study, we introduce a novel workflow \nthat employs LLMs to prioritize pools of candidate genes, \nsuch as those forming the A37 modules (Fig. 1C). We ini-\ntiated the development of this prioritization workflow by \nbenchmarking four LLMs: OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-\n4, Google’s Bard, and Anthropic’s Claude. Two primary \nbenchmarking tasks were emphasized: (1) identifying \nfunctional convergences within the candidate pool to \nelucidate relationships and biological themes, a staple \nin interpreting gene lists from transcriptomics, and (2) \nscoring individual candidates against specific relevance \ncriteria, such as potential utility as a blood biomarker \nor significance in immune cell biology. The overarching \ngoal was to utilize LLMs for the initial prioritization of \ncandidate genes. Those ranking highest would subse -\nquently undergo rigorous evaluation via our previously \ndescribed gene-centric workflow [30, 31] (Fig. 1D). Upon \nthorough characterization, these top candidates would \nbe considered for inclusion in a targeted “Transcriptome \nFingerprinting Assay” (TFA). It is important to note that, \ndiverging from our previous work centered on specific \ndiseases like COVID-19 [14], our aim here is to guide \nthe gene prioritization and characterization process \ntoward creating a generic immune profiling TFA panel \n(ImmP-TFA).\nBenchmarking LLMs on the identification of functional \nconvergences among candidate genes\nWe first compared the LLMs’ ability to identify converg -\ning functional themes among genes in a transcriptional \nmodule.\nWe selected the erythroid-restricted A37 module \nM9.2 from BloodGen3 for benchmarking. While not \nall 30 genes that constitute module M9.2 are associated \nwith erythroid cells according to existing literature, we \nanticipated that this would be a significant overarch -\ning theme for this gene list. To this end, we utilized a \ndirect prompt: \"Could you identify functional conver -\ngences among this set of genes? ALAS2 BCL2L1 BPGM \nC14ORF45 C1ORF128 CA1 EPB42 FAM46C FECH \nGMPR GPR146 GYPB GYPE IFITL1 KRT1 MARCH8 \nNFIX OR2W3 OSBP2 PLEK2 SELENBP1 SLC14A1 \nSLC4A1 SNCA TMCC2 TMOD1 TNS1 TRIM10 \nTUBB2A XK?\" The convergences identified by the vari -\nous models are detailed in Table  1. Three out of the four \nmodels identified erythrocytes or erythropoiesis as one \nof the themes, with only Google’s Bard failing to rec -\nognize this relationship. We also conducted tests using \nestablished functional tools, such as Ingenuity Pathway \nAnalysis (IPA) and DAVID [32]. Functional annota -\ntion clustering performed in DAVID identified \"Blood \ngroup antigen\" as a primary theme (represented by XK, \nGYPB, SLC14A1, SLC4A1), in addition to erythrocyte \ndevelopment and erythrocyte differentiation (ALAS2, \nBPGM, SLC4A1). The IPA identified enriched path -\nways, including Heme biosynthesis. Overall, the LLMs \nand bioinformatic tools identified the following genes \nas being associated with erythrocyte biology: ALAS2 \n(GPT3.5, GPT-4, Claude, DAVID); BPGM (GPT-4, \nDAVID); CA1 (GPT3.5); EPB42 (GPT3.5, GPT-4); \nFECH (GPT3.5, GPT-4, Claude); SLC4A1 (GPT3.5, \nGPT-4, Claude, DAVID); GYPB (GPT3.5, GPT-4); \nGYPE (GPT3.5, GPT-4); XK (GPT-4, DAVID). PubMed \nqueries using the official gene symbols AND \"erythro -\ncytes OR erythroid OR erythropoiesis\" confirmed these \nassociations. GPT-4 performed best, correctly associat -\ning 8 genes with this central theme, only missing CA1 \nidentified uniquely by GP-T3.5. GPT-3.5 made 7 asso -\nciations, while Claude made 3 associations.\nWe next tested the models’ ability to generate sim -\nple network visualizations, a common method for \nrepresenting functional associations among gene lists. \nSince the models cannot directly generate images, we \nprompted them to output R scripts to visualize a net -\nwork with nodes for themes and genes, and edges for \nfunctional associations between them. All four models \ngenerated scripts, but only GPT-4’s ran error-free and \nproduced the requested network visualization (Fig.  2). \nNotably, GPT-4 could also successfully troubleshoot \nand fix the code generated by the other models. And \nwhile Bard failed to identify erythrocyte biology as \na convergent theme after initial prompting, it did so \nwhen requested to generate a network representation. \nHowever, of the nine associations Bard made, only two \noverlapped with those from the other models/tools \n(CA1, EBP4).\nPage 9 of 33\nToufiq et al.

The gene is relevant to circulating \nleukocytes immune biology. e. The gene is a known drug \ntarget. f. The gene is therapeutically relevant for immune-\nmediated diseases. We generated scores in triplicates to \nassess within-model consistency.\nWe examined the scores obtained for the M9.2 genes to \nassess functional convergences identified earlier (Fig.  3). \nFor the first statement probing associations with eryth -\nroid cells/erythropoiesis, three of the four LLMs showed \nsubstantial convergence. The main discrepancy arose \nfrom Google’s Bard assigning high scores to genes oth -\nerwise scored low by the other models. Examining Bard’s \njustifications for the ~ 14 genes for which scoring dis -\ncrepancies occurred, we found they did not support the \nscores produced. For instance, the justification provided \nfor OBP2 was that “OSBP2 mutations have been associ -\nated with age-related macular degeneration, a condition \nthat affects the retina. ” , or for another gene: “FAM46C \nmutations are associated with multiple myeloma, a type \nof cancer of the plasma cells. ” And while these statements \nare factual (e.g. [33]), they do not pertain to erythroid \ncells or erythropoiesis. We also assessed justifications \nfrom the models for \"consensus genes\" that received \nhigh scores from all three models for the first statement. \nWe found these scores to be well-justified. For example, \nGPT-4 provided this justification for SLC4A1: “SLC4A1 \nis directly linked to erythroid cells, as it is involved in \nmaintaining the shape and survival of red blood cells. \nMutations in this gene can lead to hereditary spherocy -\ntosis” . GPT-4 also referenced Perrotta et  al. [34], which \nmentions SLC4A1’s role in full text. However, this may be \nmore an exception rather than the rule, as backing ref -\nerences generated by LLMs at this stage were rarely fac -\ntual. However, in most instances supporting statements \ncould be “manually” linked to actual references. Verifying \nall score justifications would be too time-consuming at \nthis stage, but we did do this systematically in subsequent \nsteps when focusing on the top five candidates for this \nmodule, as will be describe in detail below.\nFor the next statement (“b. The gene is currently being \nused as a biomarker in clinical settings. ”), Bard appeared to \nshow greater convergence with the other models relative to \nthe previous statement (Fig. 3B). However, GPT3.5 this time \nproduced overall much lower scores than the other three.\nWe performed correlation analyses to quantify within- \nand across-model consistency for all six statements \n(Fig.  4). Overall, we found good level of agreement \nbetween GPT-4 and Claude, with high degree of intra-\nmodel consistency. Bard and GPT3.5 showed more often \ndiscrepancies and, especially in the case of GPT3.5, poor \nwithin-model consistency and overall lower scores, with \nseveral instances where all genes received a score of 0. \nNotably, output generated by Bard and GPT3.5 was also \nmore prone to deviate from the specified format, which \nmade working with these models much more difficult.\nCollectively, the comparative analyses performed on \nthe four LLMs, across two different tasks, identified \nGPT-4 and Claude as the most proficient models. Fur -\nthermore,  the general agreement between these two \nmodels on scoring tasks presents an opportunity to \ncross-validate results, thereby enhancing the robustness \nof the prioritization process through the combined use of \nboth models.\nEstablishing a workflow for distributed candidate genes \nprioritization across A37 modules\nHaving determined that at least two of the LLMs  per -\nformed satisfacorily, we next designed a prioritization \nworkflow aiming to select a top candidate from each of \nthe eleven A37 modules.\nTo streamline this  task, we  distributed the workload \namong participants during a data mining workshop. Each \nparticipant  selected a specific  A37 module  to focus on, \nallowing for parallel processing. We introduced a work -\nflow incorporating the LLMs, guiding participants to \nselect a top candidate for their designated modules and \nproduce a ’prioritization report’ (Table  2). It should be \nnoted that the protocol delineated for module M9.2’s \ngene prioritization is consistent across the other ten A37 \nmodules. Comprehensive, sequential guidelines given to \nthe participants are detailed in the methods section.\n(See figure on next page.)\nFig. 3 LLMs scoring of M9.2 genes across multiple criteria. Line graphs show scores attributed by four LLMs to 30 genes in module M9.2. Prompts \nwere run in triplicate and scores plotted accordingly. Lines indicate moving averages.

Each panel shows scores obtained for one of six statements, which relate to the gene’s: A relevance to erythroid cells \nor erythropoiesis, B use as a clinical biomarker, C potential as a blood transcriptional biomarker, D relevance to leukocytes immune biology, E status \nas a known drug target, and F therapeutic relevance for immune mediated diseases.

Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \n \nIn summary, the workflow, described in detail below \nusing module M9.2 as an illustrative example, was as \nfollows:\n• Step1: Selecting one of the A37 modules.\n• Step 2: Identifying functional convergences among \nthe pool of candidate genes.\n• Step 3: Scoring each candidate gene across multiple \ncriteria.\n• Step 4: Prioritizing candidate genes and summarizing \njustifications.\n• Step 5: Fact checking justifications and identifying \nsupporting references\n• Step 6: Selecting a top candidate gene based on the \nvalidated scoring justifications.\n• Step 7: Factoring in transcriptome profiling data to \nfinalize the selection of the top candidate gene.\nIn total, seven researchers with a diverse range of \nexpertise and career stages are participating in these \nactivities. Top candidates have been identified for three \nA37 modules so far, with work still in progress (Table 2).\nRank scoring of the pool of candidate genes constitutive \nof a given A37 module\nThe gene count within A37 modules varies from 18 to 40, \nand M9.2, the module selected for this use case (Step 1) \nis comprised of 30 genes (Table  2). Considering the sub -\nstantial volume of biomedical literature potentially linked \nto each specific gene, it is crucial to rapidly narrow the \npool of candidates to a few top contenders.\nThe next step thus consisted in identifying functional \nconvergences among the genes constituting the module \nof interest (Step 2). This could, in some instances, permit \nto prioritize genes based on their alignment to a relevant \nfunctional theme or inform the design of scoring criteria \nthat will be applied next. GPT-4 was used for this task, \nas the best performing model for this task, as described \nabove as part of LLM benchmarking. And as reported \nearlier, in the case of M9.2 it identified ALAS2, BPGM, \nEPB42, GYPB, GYPE, SLC4A1 and XK as being associated \nwith “Erythrocyte development and function” (Table  1, \nFig. 2). These could be thus considered as potential can -\ndidates, given their alignment with the function attributed \nto this module in our earlier work (e.g. [15]). Other \nthemes identified by GPT-4 for M9.2 were: Cytoskeleton \nand cellular structure  (TNS1, TMOD1, TUBB2A) and \nUbiquitin–proteasome system (MARCH8, TRIM10).\nWe next prompted GPT-4 and Claude, as described \nearlier as part of LLM benchmarking, to score genes \nwithin a module of interest (Step 3) across the six pre-\nestablished criteria (a–f, including relevance to eryth -\nroid cells and erythropoiesis, being currently in use as a \nclinical biomarker, potential relevance as a blood tran -\nscriptional biomarker, relevance to leukocytes immune \nbiology, is a known drug target and potential therapeutic \nrelevance for immune-mediated diseases). After parsing \nof the output, the sum of average scores obtained from \nthe two model were computed, and genes were rank \nordered accordingly (Step 4; Fig.  5A). The top five M9.2 \ngenes according to this ranking were BCL2L1, ALAS2, \nSLC4A1, CA1 and FECH. BCL2L1 received high scores \nfor most categories. It presented with a distinct “scoring \nprofile” compared to the other four high scoring genes \nfrom this module (Fig.  5B). Indeed, it received much \nhigher scores for criteria related to therapeutic relevance \n(criteria e & f) and relevance to leukocyte immune biol -\nogy (criterion d). It received in comparison lower scores \non the criterion prompting its relevance to erythropoiesis \n(criterion a).\nWhile the identification of functional associations can \nprovide useful insights, we favored the supervised scor -\ning approach for the selection of top candidates that will \nbe considered in the next selection steps.\nGenerating a narrative and validating LLMs statements\nFrom the top 5 scoring candidates, we endeavored to \nselect a single gene, which would subsequently be sub -\njected to more in-depth characterization (Fig.  1D). Thus, \nwe next compiled the narratives provided by GPT-4 and \nClaude to justify the scores they attributed to each of the \nstatements when prompted earlier in Step 3. We then \nrelied on GPT-4 to summarize the statements generated \nby the models, using the following prompt: “Could you \ngenerate a coherent summary paragraph based on the \ninformation provided below? The style needs to be tech -\nnical, direct and to the point. ” This was repeated for each \nof the six criteria. We next relied on GPT-4 and Claude \nFig. 4 Benchmarking of LLMs on gene scoring tasks. Correlation plots show the degree of similarity between scores generated for a statement \nby four LLMs: GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4, Claude and Bard. Scores were generated in triplicate for each model. Plots show scoring similarities and differences \nwithin and between models. Each panel shows correlations for scores on a given statement regarding: A Relevance to erythroid cells \nor erythropoiesis. B Use as a clinical biomarker. C Potential as a blood transcriptional biomarker. D Relevance to leukocyte immune biology. E Status \nas a known drug target. F Therapeutic relevance for immune‑mediated diseases. Actual statements and prompts can be found in the Methods \nsection (Step 3)\n(See figure on next page.)\nPage 14 of 33Toufiq et al.

The prompt \nused this time was: “Could you fact-check and provide a \ncouple of supporting references for this statement? “. This \nwas repeated for each statement and verifications were \nperformed “manually” to ensure that the references were \nreal and contained the relevant information. The human-\ncurated references were then added to the summary. \nImplementing this workflow for module M9.2, our illus -\ntrative use case, yielded the following material, which was \nentirely generated by GPT-4, with supporting references \nadded manually (Step 5): \n- Function:\n“The BCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1, and FECH genes \nplay crucial roles in cellular apoptosis regulation, heme \nbiosynthesis, acid-base balance, and overall erythrocyte \nphysiology. The BCL2L1 gene encodes a critical apoptosis-\nregulating protein in the Bcl-2 family that exists as Bcl-xL \nand Bcl-xS isoforms with opposing impacts on cell survival \n[35, 36]. The ALAS2 gene instructs the production of the \n5’-aminolevulinate synthase 2 enzyme, essential for initiat-\ning heme biosynthesis in red blood cells, with mutations \nlinked to X-linked sideroblastic anemia [37]. The SLC4A1 \ngene drives the formation of an anion exchanger that mod-\nulates intracellular and extracellular pH by orchestrating \nthe exchange of chloride, bicarbonate, and carbonate ani-\nons across the cell membrane, an integral process affected \nin conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis [34, 38]. The \nCA1 gene directs the production of carbonic anhydrase 1, a \ncytosolic enzyme that helps maintain tissue and blood pH \nbalance by aiding the conversion of carbon dioxide and water \ninto bicarbonate and protons, primarily in red blood cells \n[39, 40]. Lastly, the FECH gene governs the expression of fer-\nrochelatase, the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthesis \npathway, with mutations leading to erythropoietic protopor-\nphyria due to protoporphyrin accumulation [41] .”\nTable 2 List of A37 modules undergoing prioritization\nModule ID N Genes Gene Symbols Status Top pick Report\nM9.2 30 ALAS2, BCL2L1, BPGM, C14ORF45, C1ORF128, CA1, EPB42, FAM46C, FECH, GMPR, \nGPR146, GYPB, GYPE, IFIT1L, KRT1, MARCH8, NFIX, OR2W3, OSBP2, PLEK2, SELENBP1, \nSLC14A1, SLC4A1, SNCA, TMCC2, TMOD1, TNS1, TRIM10, TUBB2A, XK\nCompleted ALAS2 Additional File 2\nM11.2 39 ABCC4, AMFR, BAT3, BMP2K, C17ORF39, C9ORF40, DNAJB2, EIF1B, GDE1, GNA12, \nHS.211743, HS.57079, IQWD1, JAZF1, MED25, NSUN3, ODC1, POLR1D, PPP2R5B, \nPSME4, RANBP10, RNF14, RSRC1, SELK, SLC2A1, SNX3, TBC1D22B, TMEM183A, \nTMEM183B, UBE2F, UBQLN1, WBP2, WDR26, WDR45, WDR51B, WNK1, ZBTB44, ZER1, \nZNF653\nCompleted WNK1 Additional File 3\nM11.3 24 ASCC2, C18ORF10, C18ORF10, DPM2, EPB49, FBXO7, FBXO7, GATA1, HAGH, HEMGN, \nHEMGN, HMBS, KEL, LOC284422, LOC440359, LOC441081, MBNL3, MBNL3, MYL4, \nPDZK1IP1, PHOSPHO1, RUNDC3A, SESN3, TESC, TGM2, TRIM10, TSPAN5, VWCE\nCompleted HMBS Additional File 4\nM11.4 25 AP2M1, AP2M1, AP2S1, ATG9A, ATG9A, B4GALT3, BCL2L13, C13ORF15, C19ORF62, \nCYB5R3, DAP , DENND1A, FAM134A, HK1, JUND, MSI2, NTAN1, NUCB1, PA2G4, \nPOLR1D, TCEB2, UBAC1, UBAP1, UBL7, UROD, WDR13, WIPI2, ZMAT2\nCompleted MSI2 Additional File 5\nM12.11 24 ALDH5A1, BNIP3L, BNIP3L, C20ORF108, DNAJA4, FAM104A, HBD, HS.105618, \nHS.291319, ISCA1L, LOC389293, MPP1, MXI1, PRDX2, PRDX2, RAB2B, RAD23A, RIOK3, \nRPIA, SIAH2, SLC1A5, TFDP1, TFDP1, TRAK2, TSTA3, UBE2O, YOD1\nCompleted HBD Additional File 6\nM13.26 40 AP2A1, ATP6V0C, BMP2K, C16ORF35, C19ORF22, C2ORF24, C9ORF78, CCDC23, \nCREG1, EIF2AK1, ELOF1, FAM100A, FOXO4, FURIN, GABARAPL2, GCLC, GPX1, H1F0, \nHDGF, ISCA1, ISCA1, LYL1, MAF1, MKRN1, NINJ2, NP , PIM1, PINK1, PNPLA2, PRR6, \nPSMF1, RFESD, RNF123, RNF14, STK33, STOM, SYT15, TERF2IP , TFDP2, XPO7, YPEL3\nCompleted SLC2A1 Additional File 7\nM13.30 32 ABCC13, ADIPOR1, ARL4A, BLVRB, BOAT, C16ORF35, CARM1, CES3, CSDA, FBXO9, \nFIS1, FKBP8, FLJ20489, GLUL, GSPT1, GUK1, GYPC, HAGH, HBM, HBQ1, HPS1, HPS1, \nPBX1, PTMS, SHARPIN, SLC25A39, ST6GALNAC4, ST6GALNAC4, TMEM86B, UBL7, \nUBXD1\nCompleted PBX1 Additional File 8\nM14.53 16 BCL2L1, BSG, CDC34, CHPT1, CHPT1, FHL2, GLRX5, IGF2BP2, KLF1, LOC650832, \nLOC653778, LOC654103, MAP2K3, MARCH8, RBM38, RIOK3, TMEM63B\nCompleted KLF1 Additional File 9\nM15.53 25 BRD4, C16ORF35, CDKL1, DPM2, EPB41, HMBS, HPS1, IQWD1, KLC3, LOC643008, \nLOC648434, LOC650898, MAP2K3, MICAL2, MICALCL, MXI1, RAB3IL1, RP11‑529I10.4, \nSLC38A5, SLC6A8, TCP11L2, TGM2, TMPRSS9, TTC25, WNK1\nCompleted BRD4 Additional File 10\nM15.74 21 ANKRD9, ATP6V0C, C22ORF25, C5ORF4, E2F2, FHL2, HMG2L1, LGALS3, LOC653907, \nMAP2K3, MARCH2, MCOLN1, MGC13057, PPM1A, PPM1A, RNF10, RNF11, SLC6A10P , \nSMOX, SRRD, TMEM158, UBE2H\nCompleted LGALS3 Additional File 11\nM15.100 17 ARHGEF12, C14ORF45, CISD2, CMBL, FLCN, GCAT, GYPE, HBBP1, LOC253012, \nPCSK1N, PLVAP , RHD, SLC6A9, SPTB, TBCEL, TMEM56, YPEL4\nCompleted SPTB Additional File 12\nPage 16 of 33Toufiq et al.

Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \n \n- Statement  a—relevance to erythroid cells and \nerythropoiesis:\n“While BCL2L1 plays a general role in controlling \ncell death, there is no evidence it is specifically associ -\nated with erythroid cells or erythropoiesis. In contrast, \nALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1, and FECH have critical roles tied \nto erythroid cell function and erythropoiesis. ALAS2 is \nhighly expressed in erythroid progenitors and is essential \nfor heme biosynthesis, a process vital for red blood cells \n[42]. SLC4A1 is highly expressed in erythroid cells, where \nit maintains pH balance and facilitates oxygen transport. \nMutations in SLC4A1 can lead to hereditary spherocyto -\nsis [43]. CA1 is strongly associated with erythroid cells \ndue to its high expression in red blood cells and role in \nmaintaining their pH balance [44]. FECH is also highly \nexpressed in erythroid cells and is essential for heme \nbiosynthesis during erythropoiesis [45, 46]. In summary, \nwhile BCL2L1 has a general role in apoptosis, ALAS2, \nSLC4A1, CA1, and FECH are integral to erythroid cell \nphysiology and erythropoiesis. ”\nStatement b—is used as a clinical biomarker:\n“The potential utility of BCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, \nCA1, and FECH as clinical biomarkers varies consider -\nably. While BCL2L1 is not commonly utilized as a bio -\nmarker in clinical settings, it might be of interest in \ncertain malignancies due to its key role in apoptosis \nregulation, although further research is warranted [47]. \nALAS2 is not extensively used as a clinical biomarker, \nexcept as a biomarker and therapeutic target for X-linked \nsideroblastic anemia [48]. SLC4A1 has clinical relevance \nas a biomarker for hereditary spherocytosis and as a ther-\napeutic target in sickle cell disease and other red blood \ncell disorders [49]. ” CA1, is not broadly used as a bio -\nmarker. “Lastly, while FECH is not typically viewed as a \n’biomarker’ in a conventional sense, its mutations serve \nas genetic markers for erythropoietic protoporphyria, \nand its deficiency can be used as a biomarker for this and \nother porphyrias [50] .”\nStatement  c—potential relevance as a blood tran -\nscriptional biomarker:\n“BCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1, and FECH each \nexhibit potential utility as blood transcriptional bio -\nmarkers in specific clinical contexts. BCL2L1, due to its \ncentral role in apoptosis regulation, holds potential as \na biomarker for diseases associated with apoptosis dys -\nregulation, including certain cancers [47], albeit further \nresearch is necessary. ALAS2, given its fundamental \nrole in heme biosynthesis, could potentially serve as a \nbiomarker for conditions such as X-linked sideroblas -\ntic anemia [48], but it is not typically utilized as a blood \ntranscriptional biomarker. SLC4A1, due to its cru -\ncial function in red blood cell physiology and its link to \nhereditary spherocytosis, may serve as a potential blood \ntranscriptional biomarker for this condition [49]. CA1, \ndue to its expression in red blood cells, could potentially \nbe used as a biomarker for conditions impacting pH bal -\nance in the blood, although more research is warranted \n[46]. Lastly, FECH, due to its critical role in heme bio -\nsynthesis, could serve as a potential blood transcriptional \nbiomarker for conditions impacting this process, how -\never, more research is needed for its broader application \n[51] .”\nStatement  d—relevance to leukocytes immune biol -\nogy:\n“The BCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1, and FECH genes \neach have varying degrees of relevance to circulating \nleukocytes immune biology. BCL2L1, due to its role in \napoptosis regulation, is crucial to the lifespan and func -\ntion of immune cells and is therefore highly relevant to \nleukocyte immune biology [52, 53]. Conversely, ALAS2, \nbeing erythroid-specific, has limited relevance to circu -\nlating leukocyte immune biology. There is no significant \nevidence pointing towards SLC4A1 having relevance \nto circulating leukocyte immune biology. CA1, despite \nbeing expressed in some circulating immune cells like \nmonocytes, only has limited relevance to immune biol -\nogy. Lastly, FECH does not display any significant rel -\nevance to the immune biology of circulating leukocytes, \nas per the current evidence. ”\nStatement e—is a known drug target:\n“The BCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1, and FECH \ngenes are each known to varying degrees as drug targets \nin clinical medicine. BCL2L1 is particularly significant \nas a target in cancer therapy, where strategies are being \ndeveloped to inhibit its anti-apoptotic function [47, 54]. \nALAS2 has been targeted for treatment of X-linked side -\nroblastic anemia, although its broader application as a \ndrug target is currently limited [55–57]. While SLC4A1 \ncould potentially be a drug target for conditions such \nas hereditary spherocytosis, more research is needed. \nCA1, as part of the carbonic anhydrase group, has been \nexplored for drug therapy potential, especially consider -\ning its role in pH regulation, and inhibitors are currently \nused or studied for conditions like glaucoma, epilepsy, \nand cancer [58]. Lastly, while FECH is not a well-docu -\nmented drug target, there is interest in its potential for \ntreating disorders related to heme biosynthesis, including \nerythropoietic protoporphyria [59] .”\nStatement  f—potential therapeutic relevance for \nimmune-mediated diseases:\nPage 18 of 33Toufiq et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \n“The BCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1, and FECH \ngenes exhibit varying degrees of therapeutic relevance \nfor immune-mediated diseases. BCL2L1, due to its role \nin regulating apoptosis in lymphocytes, holds potential \ntherapeutic value for immune-mediated diseases [60]. \nALAS2, despite its primary role in erythropoiesis, may \nhave limited relevance for immune-mediated hemo -\nlytic anemias. As of 2021, the therapeutic relevance of \nSLC4A1 for immune-mediated diseases remains unclear, \nalthough its potential impact on pH or oxygen balance \ndisorders that affect red blood cells may warrant further \nresearch [ 43, 61]. CA1 is not typically a primary target \nfor immune-mediated diseases, but the role of members \nof the carbonic anhydrase family in managing acid-base \nbalance or bone resorption in such conditions could be \nof interest [62]. Similarly, while FECH is not a well-doc -\numented target for immune-mediated diseases, potential \nrelevance may exist for certain red blood cell disorders \nor porphyrias, necessitating further investigation [63]. \nIn summary, BCL2L1 is the gene with the clearest thera -\npeutic relevance for immune-mediated diseases among \nthis group, due to its direct role in lymphocyte apoptosis. \nThe other genes have potential connections to immune \ndisease management, but require more research to deter-\nmine their broader therapeutic relevance in this context. ”\nNotably, we failed to identify backing references \nfor only one of the LLM-generated statement, which \nwas consequently removed from the summary: “CA1, \nalthough not broadly used as a biomarker, has its altera -\ntions associated with conditions such as renal carcinoma \nand primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), hence it can be uti -\nlized as a biomarker for these conditions and erythro -\ncytic disorders albeit with limitations. ” And we had to \nresort to a manual PubMed search to identify appropri -\nate references in only a few instances. Indeed, for the vast \nmajority of statements references provided by GPT-4 \nand/or Claude were real and proved pertinent.\nSelection of a top candidate gene based on summarized \njustifications\nWe next endeavored to select a top candidate from each \nmodule. We initially envisioned this task to be performed \nby the researchers, based on the information generated \nand summarized by the LLMs. However, we found that \nGPT-4 and Claude acquitted themselves well of this task \nand could provide elaborate arguments to justify their \nchoice.\nSpecifically, we requested from GPT-4 and Claude to \neach select their top candidate gene for module M9.2 \nbased on the fact-checked summarized justifications \ngenerated in Step 5, taking the six scoring criteria into \naccount (Step 6). For this task, we compared the model’s \nperformances when inputting either the fact-checked \nsummaries generated earlier in step 5 or the list of 30 \ncandidate genes forming module M9.2. We refer to these \nas “stepwise” and “direct” approaches, respectively. The \nspecific prompts and outputs from both models using \nthese two approaches can be found side-by-side in \nTable 3 (Claude) and Table  4 (GPT-4). Claude selected \nALAS2 as the top candidate gene in both instances. \nHowever, differences in the depth of the justifications \ngenerated employing the stepwise and direct approaches \nwere notable. In particular, in answering the direct \nprompt Claude omitted information about the relevance \nof ALAS2 as a clinical biomarker or therapeutic target. \nGPT-4 selected BCL2L1 as the top candidate based on its \nevaluation of human verified justifications generated for \nthe top 5 candidates (“stepwise approach”). However, it \nselected ALAS2 when prompted directly to select genes \nfrom the entire M9.2 list (“direct approach”). As can be \nseen in Table 4, despite the discrepancy the choices were \nwell justified in both instances.\nThis finding is noteworthy as it suggests that despite the \ngeneral skepticism towards LLMs in such research appli -\ncations—stemming from their inclination to generate \nfabricated information—they may reliably execute this \nspecific function. Indeed, both models, when prompted \ndirectly to select candidates among the 30 genes con -\nstituting M9.2 picked ALAS2, which was the #2 ranked \ngenes identified by our stepwise scoring approach. It \nwas also Claude’s top pick based on the evaluation of the \nfact-checked justification summaries. While our results \nthus indicate that the models might perform candidate \ngene prioritization and selection directly, segmenting the \nevaluation into intermediate phases and collecting sup -\nplemental data during these stages (e.g., scores) enhances \ntransparency. This structured approach not only boosts \ncontrol, allowing for parameter adjustments, but also \nfosters trust since it facilitates verification of the data, \nunderpinning the decisions taken.\nLeveraging reference transcriptome datasets for the final \ncandidate selection\nFor module M9.2, GPT-4 and Claude selected different \ncandidates from the top 5 ranked genes. Given this dis -\ncrepancy, we proceeded to examine if the models could \nutilize transcriptome profiling data to refine the prioriti -\nzation of leading candidates (Step 7).\nWe focused more specifically on three datasets, which \nmeasured transcript abundance in isolated cell popu -\nlations, thus permitting to assess the restriction of the \nexpression of the top 5 candidates.\nThe first dataset profiling transcript abundance across \na wide range of hematopoietic cells and precursors \n(GSE24759, [21]), is available from our developmental \nimmunology GXB collection (http:// devel opmen  talim \nPage 19 of 33\nToufiq et al.

Here is a summary of my assessment:\nAfter reviewing the provided gene list and weighing the 6 specified criteria \nequally, I would select ALAS2 as the top candidate. Here is the rationale:\nCLAUDE on criterion 1 Relevance to erythroid cells/erythropoiesis: ALAS2 has the most direct relevance, \nas it encodes an enzyme essential for initiating heme biosynthesis specifically \nin red blood cells. Mutations are linked to an erythroid condition\nRelevance to erythroid cells/erythropoiesis: ALAS2 encodes the rate‑limiting \nenzyme in heme biosynthesis and is highly specific to erythroid cells. It is critical \nfor hemoglobin production\nCLAUDE on criterion 2 Current biomarker use: ALAS2 is used as a biomarker and therapeutic target \nfor a red blood cell disorder, X‑linked sideroblastic anemia. This is more significant \nbiomarker use compared to the other genes\nCurrent biomarker use: ALAS2 is not routinely used yet as a biomarker\nCLAUDE on criterion 3 Potential blood transcriptional biomarker: ALAS2 has clear potential as a bio‑\nmarker for conditions affecting heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis, \nthough not yet utilized broadly\nPotential as a blood transcriptional biomarker: As an erythroid‑specific gene, \nchanges in ALAS2 expression could indicate altered erythropoiesis\nCLAUDE on criterion 4 Relevance to leukocyte biology: ALAS2 has limited relevance to leukocytes \ngiven its erythroid specificity\nRelevance to immune cells: ALAS2 does not have a known role in leukocytes\nCLAUDE on criterion 5 Known drug target: ALAS2 is an established drug target for X‑linked sideroblastic \nanemia\nKnown drug target: ALAS2 is not currently targeted by drugs\nCLAUDE on criterion 6 Therapeutic relevance for immune diseases: ALAS2 may have relevance \nfor immune‑mediated hemolytic anemias, though therapeutic applications are \ncurrently limited\nTherapeutic relevance in immune diseases: ALAS2 does not have a demonstrated \nrole\nCLAUDE’s conclusive statement In summary, ALAS2 has the most direct significance for erythroid cells/eryth‑\nropoiesis, an existing biomarker role, blood biomarker potential, and known \ndrug target status. Though limited in leukocyte relevance and immune disease \napplications, it appears the strongest candidate based on weighting the criteria \nequally.

Here’s how this gene stacks \nup against the six criteria:\nBased on the given criteria, the top candidate from your provided gene list appears \nto be ALAS2\nGPT‑4 on criterion 1 Relevance to erythroid cells or erythropoiesis: BCL2L1 is associated with erythroid \ncells through its control of apoptosis, though it’s not specifically linked to erythro‑\npoiesis\nRelevance to erythroid cells or erythropoiesis: ALAS2 (delta‑aminolevulinate \nsynthase 2) is highly relevant to erythroid cells and erythropoiesis. This enzyme \ncatalyzes the first step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. It’s specifically expressed \nin erythroid cells and mutations in this gene can lead to X‑linked sideroblastic \nanemia\nGPT‑4 on criterion 2 Current use as a biomarker: Although BCL2L1 is not widely used as a biomarker, it \ncould be of interest in certain malignancies due to its key role in apoptosis regula‑\ntion\nCurrent use as a biomarker: As of my knowledge cut‑off in 2021, ALAS2 is not fre‑\nquently used as a biomarker. However, changes in its expression or mutations in this \ngene are associated with erythropoietic diseases\nGPT‑4 on criterion 3 Potential use as a blood transcriptional biomarker: BCL2L1, due to its role in apop‑\ntosis regulation, has potential as a biomarker for diseases associated with apopto‑\nsis dysregulation, including certain cancers\nPotential use as a blood transcriptional biomarker: Given its specific expression \nin erythroid cells, ALAS2 could potentially serve as a blood transcriptional bio‑\nmarker, particularly in conditions affecting red blood cell formation\nGPT‑4 on criterion 4 Relevance to leukocytes immune biology: BCL2L1 is highly relevant to leukocyte \nimmune biology due to its role in regulating the lifespan and function of immune \ncells\nRelevance to leukocytes immune biology: While not directly involved in leuko‑\ncyte biology, heme and iron metabolism (in which ALAS2 is involved) can impact \nimmune cell function and overall immune responses\nGPT‑4 on criterion 5 Being a known drug target: BCL2L1 is significant as a target in cancer therapy, \nwith strategies being developed to inhibit its anti‑apoptotic function\nBeing a known drug target: Although not a direct target for drugs, ALAS2 is the tar‑\nget of gene therapy for X‑linked sideroblastic anemia, demonstrating therapeutic \nrelevance\nGPT‑4 on criterion 6 Therapeutic relevance for immune mediated diseases: BCL2L1 holds potential \ntherapeutic value for immune‑mediated diseases due to its role in regulating \napoptosis in lymphocytes\nTherapeutic relevance for immune mediated diseases: While not directly relevant \nto immune‑mediated diseases, the role of iron and heme metabolism in immune \nresponses and inflammation indirectly ties ALAS2 to immune disease processes. \nAdditionally, alterations in erythropoiesis and red blood cells can influence immune \nresponses and disease progression\nGPT‑4’s conclusive statement While the other genes listed also meet some of these criteria to varying extents, \nBCL2L1 appears to be the best fit when considering all criteria equally\nSo while not all criteria are strongly met, given the specific criteria and the gene list \nprovided, ALAS2 seems the most balanced candidate. The consideration of ALAS2 \nas the top candidate assumes that the six criteria are independent and weighted \nequally; changes in weighting or interactions between criteria may affect this selec‑\ntion. Furthermore, updates in our understanding of gene function, disease associa‑\ntions, or biomarker utility after 2021 could also affect this choice\nPage 21 of 33\nToufiq et al.

The second dataset measuring transcript abun -\ndance in monocytes, neutrophils, B-cells, CD4 + T-cells, \nCD8 + T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells and in whole \nblood (GSE6042459, [18]). It is accessible via the “CD2K” \nGXB collection (http:// cd2k. gxbsi dra. org/ dm3/ geneB \nrowser/ show/ 40000 98). For additional perspective, a \nthird transcriptome dataset, which measured transcript \nabundance in whole blood in patients with a wide range \nof pathological or physiological states was also accessed \n(GSE100150). This collection of reference datasets was \nemployed for the development of our BloodGen3 mod -\nule repertoire and has been described in detail previously \n[17]. The data is available via the CD2K GXB instance \n(http:// cd2k. gxbsi dra. org/ dm3/ geneB rowser/ list): “ A \nTranscriptome Fingerprinting Assay for Clinical Immune \nMonitoring” datasets] and BloodGen3 app (https:// drinc \nhai. shiny apps. io/ Blood Gen3M odule/).\nWe first retrieved the transcriptional profiles of \nBCL2L1, ALAS2, SLC4A1, CA1 and FECH. Abundance \nprofiles of those five genes across the comprehensive \nset of hematopoietic cells and precursors assembled \nby Novershtern et  al. indicated a high level of restric -\ntion of their expression in CD71 + GYPA + erythroid cell \npopulations (ERY3-5 populations) (Fig.  6A). As we have \nreported previously, it is a characteristic that is common \nto most genes constituting A37 modules. However, nota -\nbly, BCL2L1 displayed overall much lower abundance \nlevels in comparison to the other four genes. In the sec -\nond reference dataset from Speake et  al., high levels of \nexpression were detected in whole blood for BCL2L1, \nSLC4A1 and ALAS2, in comparison to isolated leukocyte \npopulations (Fig.  6B). This is consistent with these genes \nbeing expressed by circulating erythroid cells which are \npresent in whole blood but would be excluded upon iso -\nlation of various leukocyte populations. Notably, abun -\ndance levels observed in whole blood were considerably \nhigher for ALAS2 and to some extent BCL2L1, when \ncompared to SLC4A1, FECH and CA1 levels. The whole \nblood transcriptome profiles from the BloodGen3 data -\nset confirmed at the level of module M9.2 that the over -\nall abundance of the genes constituting this module was \nincreased most prominently in the whole blood of sub -\njects with metastatic melanoma, in pregnant women, \nfollowed by patients with acute respiratory syncytial \nvirus (RSV) infection and liver transplant recipients \n(Fig.  7A).   Decreased abundance was most prominently \nobserved in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), HIV \ninfection, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \n(COPD), Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) and Influenza \nvirus infection.\n Integrating this information into the LLM-driven pri -\noritization and selection process posed a challenge, espe -\ncially in ensuring that the models received both the data \nand the essential contextual metadata for interpretation. \nGiven that the main interface for generative LLMs is text \nwe endeavored to convert expression tables into textual \ninput. For this a concatenating function was utilized to \nautomatically generate sentences such as: “In Human \nNeutrophils, RNA sequencing detected BCL2L1 RNA at \na count of 34” , which encapsulates both measurements \nand parameters such as, measurement method, species, \nor sample types. Another such generated sentence for the \nAltman et al. dataset was: “In Human Whole blood, the \nabundance of BCL2L1 RNA measured by Microarrays \ndiffered in patients with acute influenza infection com -\npared to controls by a Log2 fold change of − 0.3697682” . \nHere we adopted a multi-tier prompting strategy which \npermitted to factor in altogether the fact-checked sum -\nmarized justifications obtained earlier in step 5 and the \ntextualized expression values from the three reference \ndatasets. Five separate prompts were designed to carry \nout this task (see methods for details).\nFig. 6 Transcriptional profiles of the top 5 scoring candidate genes in reference leukocyte transcriptome datasets.

Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \n \nIn response to the first prompt, which provided the \nfact-checked summarized justifications from step 5 as \ninput, the results obtained were similar to those reported \nearlier for Step 6, with GPT-4 selecting BCL2L1 as its \ntop pick and Claude selecting ALAS2. These selections \nwere maintained despite additional guiding contextual \ninformation being provided in the prompt: “Based on the \nsummary below, please recommend the top candidate \ngene to include in a targeted blood transcriptional profil -\ning panel. The intent is for the selected gene to be rep -\nresentative of an erythroid cell signature associated with \nresponse to mRNA vaccines, severity of RSV infection \nand that found to be expressed at high levels in patients \nwith metastatic melanoma and in liver transplant recipi -\nents. Please weigh the following criteria equally in your \nrecommendation: [etc. …]” . GPT-4 and Claude’s full \nresponse to this and subsequent prompts can be found in \nTable 5.\nThe second prompt provided as input the textual -\nized transcriptional profiling data from the Speake et al. \ndataset. At the end of the prompt the following request \nwas made: “Given this additional RNA-seq expression \ndata, does your recommended gene selection remain the \nsame? Please explain which gene you would recommend \nat this stage and why, incorporating both the summarized \ninformation provided earlier and RNA-seq data in your \nrationale” . Claude maintained its initial recommenda -\ntion of ALAS2 “as the top candidate gene to include in \nthe targeted blood transcriptional profiling panel” . Fur -\nther stating that “The RNA-seq data confirms the eryth -\nroid-specific expression of ALAS2, with counts of 616 in \nwhole blood but only 1 in all the leukocyte subsets. This \naligns perfectly with the intent to select a gene represent-\native of an erythroid signature. ” (see Table  5 for the full \ntranscript). Notably, the textualized transcriptome data \nprovided at this step led GPT-4 to reconsider its choice \nof BCL2L1 as its top candidate, selecting ALAS2 instead: \n“With the addition of the RNA-seq data, it’s clear that \nALAS2 is the most abundantly expressed gene in whole \nblood with a count of 616. This contrasts with BCL2L1, \nthe initially recommended gene, which exhibits a lower \nexpression level in whole blood (280). Importantly, \nALAS2 demonstrates minimal expression in all other \ntested immune cells (counts of 1), suggesting a strong \nerythroid cell-specific expression, fitting the criteria to be \nrepresentative of an erythroid cell signature. BCL2L1, on \nthe other hand, is more uniformly expressed across vari -\nous cell types, which makes it less specific to erythroid \ncells. Given these findings, I recommend reconsidering \nthe selection and placing ALAS2 as the top candidate \ngene for inclusion in the targeted blood transcriptional \nprofiling panel. ” GPT-4 goes on to detail its rationale, to \nfinally conclude: “By combining both the RNA-seq data \nand the summary provided earlier, it appears that ALAS2 \nwould be a more appropriate candidate due to its high \nexpression in whole blood and its critical role in eryth -\nropoiesis, despite its limited involvement in leukocyte \nimmune biology and use in immune-mediated diseases. ”\nWe in turn attempted to input textualized transcrip -\ntional profiling data from the Novershtern et al. and Alt -\nman et al. datasets. We were not successful with GPT-4, \ngiven limits imposed on the amount of information it \ncan receive as input (8192 tokens), which was exceeded \nby the Novershtern dataset. Breaking the input down in \nmultiple prompts was unsuccessful as GPT-4 lost the \nthread of the conversation as a result and failed to factor \nin the summarized justification and the earlier RNAseq \ndataset in its selection of a top candidate. This was also \nthe case when the Novershtern et al. dataset was omitted \nand only the Altman dataset provided (Table  5). No such \nissues were however encountered with Claude, which \nsupports 100,000 tokens of context. We were thus suc -\ncessful in inputting transcriptional profiles for all three \ndatasets and completed all the prompts (Table 5). Prompt \n5 stated: “Could you please summarize the key conclu -\nsions you have drawn from the conversation so far? “, \nwhich Claude answered as follows: “Based on reviewing \nthe initial summary, RNA-seq data, microarray data, and \npatient cohort fold change data provided sequentially, \nmy conclusions are: I would recommend ALAS2 as the \ntop candidate gene for inclusion in the intended tar -\ngeted blood transcriptional profiling panel based on its: \n(1) Crucial, erythroid-specific role in heme biosynthesis, \nmaking it a good representation of an erythroid signature, \n(2) Lack of expression in leukocytes and high, restricted \nexpression in erythroblast subsets, confirmed by both \nRNA-seq and microarrays, (3) Large, consistent fold \nchanges across conditions like RSV infection, juvenile \n(See figure on next page.)\nFig. 7 Transcriptional profiles of the top 5 scoring candidate genes across 16 reference blood transcriptome datasets.

It is important to note, however, that the util‑\nity and effectiveness of BCL2L1 as a representative of an erythroid cell signature will depend \non the specific clinical and research contexts, and further research might be necessary to fully \nconfirm its potential in this regard\nPROMP 2: Now that you have provided an initial recommen‑\ndation based on the summary, take into account the follow‑\ning RNA‑sequencing expression data from key immune cell types \nand whole blood samples: [input textualized transcriptional data]. \nGiven this additional RNA‑seq expression data, does your recom‑\nmended gene selection remain the same?

The other genes appear more broadly \nexpressed across leukocytes based on the RNA‑seq data\nCopy\nWith the addition of the RNA‑seq data, it’s clear that ALAS2 is the most abundantly expressed \ngene in whole blood with a count of 616. This contrasts with BCL2L1, the initially recom‑\nmended gene, which exhibits a lower expression level in whole blood (280). Importantly, ALAS2 \ndemonstrates minimal expression in all other tested immune cells (counts of 1), suggesting \na strong erythroid cell‑specific expression, fitting the criteria to be representative of an erythroid \ncell signature. BCL2L1, on the other hand, is more uniformly expressed across various cell types, \nwhich makes it less specific to erythroid cells\nGiven these findings, I recommend reconsidering the selection and placing ALAS2 as the top \ncandidate gene for inclusion in the targeted blood transcriptional profiling panel. Here’s why:\n1. Relevance to erythroid cells and erythropoiesis: ALAS2 plays an essential role in heme biosyn‑\nthesis in red blood cells, a process critical for erythropoiesis\n2. Current use as a biomarker: ALAS2 is used as a biomarker and therapeutic target for X‑linked \nsideroblastic anemia\n3. Potential use as a blood transcriptional biomarker: Although not typically utilized as a blood \ntranscriptional biomarker, its high expression in whole blood and critical role in erythropoiesis \nhighlight its potential\n4. Relevance to leukocyte immune biology: Although it has limited relevance to circulating leu‑\nkocyte immune biology due to its erythroid‑specific nature, its low expression in other immune \ncells supports its specificity for erythroid cells\n5. Status as a known drug target: ALAS2 has been targeted for the treatment of X‑linked sidero‑\nblastic anemia\n6. Therapeutic relevance for immune‑mediated diseases: Although it has limited relevance \nfor immune‑mediated diseases, it can be relevant for immune‑mediated hemolytic anemias\n7. By combining both the RNA‑seq data and the summary provided earlier, it appears that ALAS2 \nwould be a more appropriate candidate due to its high expression in whole blood and its critical \nrole in erythropoiesis, despite its limited involvement in leukocyte immune biology and use \nin immune‑mediated diseases\nPage 26 of 33Toufiq et al.

Let’s summarize \nsome of the notable findings:\n1.BCL2L1: BCL2L1 expression seems to increase in cases of B‑cell deficiency, metastatic \nmelanoma, sepsis, pregnancy, active pulmonary tuberculosis, acute respiratory syncytial virus \ninfection, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, staphylococcus aureus infection, and liver \ntransplant recipients.

Overall, the findings obtained in this \nuse case demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in aiding \nwith rationale target prioritization and selection, with \nminimal human input.\nThe workflow described above has been implemented \nin other modules by participants in the data mining \nworkshop. As a result, we were able to parallelize this \nprocess and proceed with the selection of candidates \nfrom the 11 A37 modules (Table 2). Prioritization reports \nare available as supplementary material (Additional File \n2, Additional File 3, Additional File 4, Additional File 5, \nAdditional File 6 and Additional File 7, Additional File 8, \nAdditional File 9, Additional File 10, Additional File 11, \nAdditional File 12), and LLM scores have been generated \nfor all 11 modules (Fig. 8).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the potential utility \nof large language models (LLMs) in addressing a signifi -\ncant bottleneck in the knowledge-driven selection of can-\ndidate biomarkers derived from systems-scale molecular \nprofiling data. LLMs were successfully integrated into \na new candidate gene prioritization workflow situated \ndownstream of an established transcriptional module \nrepertoire construction algorithm [17, 64], and upstream \nof a gene-centric workflow designed for the in-depth \ncharacterization of candidate genes [30, 31] (Fig.  1). \nLLM tasks ranged from identifying convergences among \ngenes in a circulating erythroid module, to scoring can -\ndidates based on specific contextualized criteria, to sum -\nmarizing justifications, retrieving supporting references, \nand determining an overall candidate for inclusion in a \ntargeted transcriptional assay measuring a circulating \nerythroid signature, relying both on the interpretation of \nbiomedical knowledge and transcriptional profiling data. \nBenchmarking multiple LLMs quickly revealed that not \nall four models tested could perform these tasks satisfac -\ntorily. Indeed, only two models were eventually employed \nfor candidate gene prioritization and selection: GPT-4, \nthe most advanced model from OpenAI, and Claude, a \nmodel developed by Anthropic. This decision was made \ndespite certain accessibility limitations, as GPT-4 is avail-\nable only to \"OpenAI plus\" subscribers, and at the time \nof writing, Claude was only accessible in the United \nStates and the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that \nAnthropic released Claude 2 after our benchmarking \nwas completed. We observed noticeable improvements \nin both the speed and quality of the output generated by \nClaude 2, which reaffirmed our decision to utilize both \nGPT-4 and Claude concurrently when performing these \ntasks.\nOne critical aspect of the work was designing suitable \n“prompting strategies” . One of the key prompts which we \ndevised requested models to provide numerical scores \nindicating a statement’s accuracy for a given gene. It also \nspecified an output format, facilitating subsequent pars -\ning of the large volume of information generated. LMMs \nproved capable of scoring straightforward statements, \nlike evaluating a gene’s association with erythroid cells \nor erythropoiesis – information which arguably could \nalso at least partly be retrieved from Gene Ontology or \npathway enrichment tools, albeit lacking the nuances \noffered by a 1–10 scoring system. But more interest -\ningly, models could also score more contextualized and \nnuanced statements, like potential utility as a blood tran -\nscriptional biomarker, relevance to leukocyte biology, or \ntherapeutic relevance for immune diseases. In doing so, \nLMMs performed basic inferencing, for instance linking \na gene’s erythropoiesis role and biomarker potential, and \nincorporated these inferences when scoring candidates. \nThe process of designing prompts involved some experi -\nmentation, and in some instances, it was \"collaborative\" \nas we sought feedback from the models to enhance the \nclarity and scope of the prompts. We also found that the \nquality and accuracy of the output generated by the Large \nLanguage Models (LLMs) were directly proportional to \nthe extent of the task. For instance, LLMs showed reluc -\ntance to identify functional convergences for extensive \ngene lists (~ > 30) or provided limited justifications when \ntasked with scoring more than 2–3 genes in a single \nprompt—which was the maximum number suggested by \nGPT-4. And as a result, we decided to request the scoring \nof only one gene per prompt. Perhaps most notably, the -\nsupporting references requested while prompting LLMs \nfor scores and justifications on six different statements \nwere seldom factual. However, they were consistently \nPage 30 of 33Toufiq et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \naccurate at a later stage when the LLMs were prompted \nto provide supporting references for specific statements \n(Step 5). Notably, the phrasing of the prompt was found \nto be critical for this task. When requested directly to \nprovide relevant references supporting a given statement \nGPT-4 often declined and explained that it was “beyond \nFig. 8 Overview of LLM‑generated scores for A37 module genes. This network represents the scores generated by two LLMs, GPT‑4 and Claude, \nfor six prespecified criteria, across a pool of candidate genes distributed across 11 BloodGen3 modules from the aggregate A37. Each pie chart \nshows the relative magnitude of the averaged score from the two models. The size of each chart is proportional to the overall cumulative score \nacross the six criteria\nPage 31 of 33\nToufiq et al. Journal of Translational Medicine          (2023) 21:728 \n \nits ability as a language model” . But when requested to \nfact-check a statement and provide backing references \nit readily obliged and acquitted itself of this task well. \nAnother powerful application of LLMs in this workflow \nwas the synthesis of information generated by the mod -\nels themselves to justify the scores attributed to the top \nranked genes. Indeed, after researchers fact-checked \nthese statements—which again involved using LLMs to \nretrieve backing references—it was possible to utilize \nthese summaries to request the models to identify their \ntop pick. Notably, both GPT-4 and Claude performed \nthis task remarkably well, providing elaborate and logical \nargumentation to support their choices. Yet, divergences \nin “opinion” between the two models remained for the \npick of the top candidate for M9.2 module, which was set-\ntled with the input of transcriptome profiling data, that \nthe models were able to consider in making their final \ndetermination, eventually converging to select ALAS2 as \nthe top candidate for this module. This finding is notable \nas it opens the possibility of generalizing the use of LLMs \nfor biomedical data analysis and interpretation.\nWhile our results are promising, it is important to \nacknowledge the inherent limitations of these models. As \nwidely reported and experienced here, LLM-generated \ninformation is not always factual. As mentioned earlier, \nwhen prompted for backing references for the state -\nments generated in association to their scores (Step 3), \neven the best models largely provided “fake” references. \nAs demonstrated,   instances of information \"halluci -\nnation\"  can be addressed  through prompt engineering \nand  fact-checking. However these issues, which  have \nbeen widely reported, present considerable challenges  to \nthe adoption of LLMs as research tools in biomedicine. \nFor this reason, even though, as we have shown, LLMs \ncould reasonably handle the task of prioritizing a list of \ncandidate genes when directly prompted, the level of \ntrust in the models and the answers they generate could \nbe insufficient for systematic  adoption. Thus, the multi-\nstep process that we implemented, which includes checks \nand balances and improves transparency of the decision-\nmaking process, might offer a viable pathway towards \nmore widespread adoption of LLMs as research tools.\nAnother inherent limitation of LLMs is that their relia -\nbility is closely tied to the quality and comprehensiveness \nof the training data. While they excel at aggregating and \nsummarizing vast amounts of existing biomedical litera -\nture, they may be limited in generating insights beyond \nwhat is already documented. In our view, LLMs are \nunlikely to replace traditional scientific methods; instead, \nthey serve as valuable augmentations. They streamline \nthe laborious process of sifting through extensive litera -\nture and data, as exemplified in our knowledge-driven \ngene prioritization pipeline.\nIn recognition of the rapidly evolving landscape of Large \nLanguage Models (LLMs) and their associated tools, we \nalso acknowledge the limitation of focusing on a select \nfew models in this study. At the time of this research, our \nchoice centered around widely recognized and empiri -\ncally proven models, specifically OpenAI’s GPT-4 and \nAnthropic’s Claude, as these provided a robust baseline \nfor our gene prioritization tasks. While newer models and \ntools continue to emerge, offering potentially different \ncapabilities or performance metrics, the LLMs chosen for \nthis project were deemed most suitable for this specific \napplication. Future iterations of this work may benefit \nfrom evaluating these emerging technologies, but for the \nscope and timing of the current project, we believe our \nselection was appropriate and effective.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings underscore LLMs potential \nin enhancing knowledge-driven candidate gene prior -\nitization  and selection processes. Through this study, we \ndemonstrated that LLMs could direct gene selection with \nminimal human input, bringing about significant advance-\nments in efficiency and productivity. Our ongoing efforts \nin developing scripts for interfacing with the GPT-4 and \nClaude APIs should further expedite the prioritization \nof extensive module repertoires  such as  BloodGen3 and \npave the way for the creation of a universal immune pro -\nfiling TFA panel. Moreover, basic parameter adjustments \nin such streamlined workflow  could also  allow for the \ndesign of disease-specific panels with minimal effort. As \npreviously demonstrated with our work on COVID-19, \nthis could include favoring the selection of genes specifi -\ncally relevant to the pathophysiology of the target disease \n[14]. Although this development is still in its preliminary \nstages, our objective is to provide a tool that streamlines \nthe gene prioritization process while maintaining trans -\nparency, accuracy, and relevance, especially in the context \nof disease-specific applications.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s12967‑ 023‑ 04576‑8.\nAdditional file 1: Is a spreadsheet including numerical and textual \noutputs generated by the models and data transformations operated for \nmodule M9.2.\nAdditional file 2: Is the prioritization report for module M9.2 authored by \nDamien Chaussabel.
