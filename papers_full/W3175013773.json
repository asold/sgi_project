Without being guided\nby structural information in training, PLMs show\nthe potential for learning implicit syntactic struc-\ntures and language semantic, which can be trans-\nferred to other tasks. To better understand and\nleverage what PLMs have learned, several work\nhas emerged to probe or induce syntactic structures\nfrom PLMs. According to prior studies (Rogers\net al., 2020), most existing work focuses on syn-\ntactic structures such as part of speech (Liu et al.,\n∗Work done during an internship at Microsoft Research.\nThe ﬁrst three authors contributed equally.\nReign Monarchs\n1789-1802 George\n1802-1826 John I\n1826-1845 Andrew\n George   \nWashington\nwhat war was george washington associated with?\nU.S. President\nColonial Beach\n(a).

However,\nas well known, semantic information is essential\nfor high-level tasks like machine reading compre-\nhension (Wang and Jiang, 2019).\nRegarding to language semantics, an impor-\ntant branch is grounding, which is overlooked by\nmost previous work. Broadly speaking, grounding\nmeans “connecting linguistic symbols to real-world\nperception or actions” (Roy, 2005). It is generally\nthought to be important for a variety of tasks, such\nas video descriptions (Zhou et al., 2019), visual\nquestion answering (Zhu et al., 2016) and semantic\nparsing (Guo et al., 2019). In this paper, we focus\non single-modal scenarios, where grounding refers\nmore speciﬁcally to mapping linguistic tokens into\na real-world concept described in natural language.\nAs shown in Figure 1, “george washington” can\nbe grounded into either a cell value in a structured\ntable, or an entity in knowledge bases.\nIn single-modal scenarios, grounding is espe-\ncially important for semantic parsing, the task of\ntranslating a natural language sentence into its cor-\nresponding executable logic form. For earlier work,\ngrounding is essential since earlier work almost\nconceptualized semantic parsing as grounding an\n1175\nHow many total games were at braly stadium [SEP][CLS] Venue\nQuestion Concept\nPLM\n0.14 0.10 0.21 0.01 0.14 0.18 0.06 0.16 Latent Grounding\ngeorge\nPLM\n0.02 0.03 0.05 0.12 0.04 0.11 0.08 0.27 Pseudo Alignment\nConcept Prediction Confidence\n0.92\n0.65\nErasingHow many total games were at braly [SEP][CLS] Venue\nGrounding Module\nCP\nCP\nAwakening\nFigure 2: The illustration of E TA, which consists of a PLM module, a Concept Prediction (CP) module and a\ngrounding module. Two models (gray and blue) are drawn here for illustration purposes, and they are indeed\nthe same. The model training involves three steps: (1) The concept prediction module is trained to predict the\nconﬁdence of any concept occurring in a given question ( Left). (2) The erasing mechanism erases tokens in the\nquestion sequentially, feeds them into CP, and obtains the conﬁdence differences (e.g.,0.92 −0.65 = 0.27) as the\npseudo alignment. Here we only demonstrate the process related to “stadium” ( Bottom Right). (3) The pseudo\nalignment is employed to awaken the latent grounding, i.e., to supervise the grounding module ( Top Right). We\nshow only one concept “Venue” for the sake of brevity, which in practice is a sequence of concepts.\nutterance to a task-speciﬁc meaning representation\n(Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins,\n2005; Liang et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2017). As for\nmodern approaches based on the encoder-decoder\narchitecture, grounding also plays an important\nrole and considerable work has demonstrated the\npositive effect of it (Guo et al., 2019; Dong et al.,\n2019; Liu et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b; Chen\net al., 2020). Despite its success, existing ground-\ning methods mainly relied on heavy manual efforts\nlike high-quality lexicons (Reddy et al., 2016) or ad-\nhoc heuristic rules like n-gram matching (Guo et al.,\n2019), suffering from poor ﬂexibility. To explore\nmore ﬂexible methods, researchers recently tried a\ndata-driven way: they collected grounding annota-\ntions as supervision to train grounding models (Li\net al., 2020a; Lei et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). How-\never, this modeling ﬂexibility in their approaches\nrequires expensive annotations of grounding, which\nmost of the time are not available.\nTo alleviate the above issues, we present a novel\napproach Erasing-then-Awakening (ETA)1. It is in-\nspired by recent advances in interpretable machine\nlearning (Samek et al., 2017), where the impor-\ntance of individual pixels can be quantiﬁed with\nrespect to the classiﬁcation decision. Similarly, our\napproach ﬁrstly quantiﬁes the contribution of each\nword with respect to each concept, by erasing it\nand probing the variation of concept prediction de-\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/\nmicrosoft/ContextualSP\ncisions (elaborated later). Then it employs these\ncontributions as pseudo labels to awaken latent\ngrounding from PLMs. In contrast to prior work,\nour approach only needs supervision of concept pre-\ndiction, which can be easily derived by downstream\ntasks (e.g., text-to-SQL) instead of full grounding\nsupervision. Empirical studies on four datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach can awaken latent\ngrounding which is understandable to human ex-\nperts. It is highly non-trivial because our approach\nis not exposed to any human-annotated grounding\nlabel in training. More importantly, we ﬁnd that the\ngrounding can be easily coupled with downstream\nmodels to boost their performance, and the abso-\nlute improvement is up to 9.8%. In summarization,\nour contribution is as three-fold:\n1. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst\none to highlight and demonstrate the possibil-\nity of awakening latent grounding from PLMs.\n2. We propose a novel weakly supervised ap-\nproach erasing-then-awakening, to awaken la-\ntent grounding from PLMs. Empirical stud-\nies on four datasets demonstrate that our ap-\nproach can awaken latent grounding which is\nunderstandable to human experts.\n3. Taking text-to-SQL as a case study, we suc-\ncessfully couple our approach with two off-\nthe-shelf parsers. Experimental results on two\nbenchmarks show the effectiveness of our ap-\nproach on boosting downstream performance.\n1176\n2 Method: Erasing-then-Awakening\nIn the task of grounding, we are given a ques-\ntion x = ⟨x1,··· ,xN ⟩and a concept set C =\n{c1,··· ,cK}, where each concept consists of sev-\neral tokens. The goal of grounding is to ﬁnd out\ntokens (also known as mentions) in x which are\nrelevant to concepts in C. Generally, the grounding\nprocedure learns to create a N×K matrix, which\nwe call latent grounding. In some cases, a set of\npairs is needed, of which each one explicitly shows\na token and a concept is grounded. We call this\nkind of pairs as grounding pairs below.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, our model consists\nof a PLM module, a CP module and a grounding\nmodule. In this section, we ﬁrst present the training\nprocedure of ETA, which at a high-level involves\nthree steps: (1) Train an auxiliary concept predic-\ntion module. (2) Erase tokens in a question to ob-\ntain the concept prediction conﬁdence differences\nas pseudo alignment. (3) Awaken latent ground-\ning from PLMs by applying pseudo alignment as\nsupervision. Then we introduce the procedure to\nproduce grounding pairs in inference.\n2.1 Training a Concept Prediction Module\nGiven x and C, the goal of the concept prediction\nmodule is to identify if each concept ck ∈ Cis\nmentioned or not in the question x. Although it\ndoes not seem to be directly related to grounding, it\nis a pre-requisite for the erasing mechanism, which\nwill be elaborated later. As for ck’s supervision\nlk ∈ {0,1}, it is the weak supervision ETA re-\nlies on, and can be readily obtained through down-\nstream task signals. Taking text-to-SQL as an illus-\ntration, each database schema (i.e., table, column\nand cell value) in an annotated SQL can be consid-\nered as mentioned in the question ( lk = 1), with\nothers as negative examples (lk = 0).\nOnce the supervision is prepared, the CP module\nis trained to conduct binary classiﬁcation over the\nrepresentation of each concept. As done in previ-\nous work (Hwang et al., 2019), we ﬁrst concatenate\nthe question and all concepts into a sequence as\ninput to the PLM module. As illustrated in Fig-\nure 2, the input sequence starts with [CLS], with\nthe question and each concept being separated by\n[SEP]. Then, the sequence is fed into the PLM\nmodule to produce deep contextual representations\nover each position. Denoting ⟨q1,q2,..., qN ⟩and\n⟨e1,e2,..., eK⟩as the token representations and\nconcept representations, they can be obtained by:\n{qn}N\nn= 1, {ek}K\nk= 1=PLM\n(\n[CLS],x,{[SEP], ck}K\nk= 1\n)\n, (1)\nwhere qn and ek correspond to the representations\nat the position of n-th question token and the ﬁrst\ntoken in ck respectively. Finally, each concept rep-\nresentation ek is passed to a classiﬁer to predict if\nit is mentioned in x as:\npk = Sigmoid(Wl ek), (2)\nwhere Wl is a learnable parameter. pk is the prob-\nability of ck mentioned in the question, which is\nreferred to by concept prediction conﬁdence below.\n2.2 Erasing Question Tokens\nOnce the concept prediction module is converged,\nwe apply an erasing mechanism to assist in the\nfollowing awakening phase. It follows a similar\nidea from the interpretable document classiﬁcation\n(Arras et al., 2016), where a word is considered im-\nportant for the document classiﬁcation if removing\nit and classifying the modiﬁed document results\nin a strong decrease of the classiﬁcation score. In\nour case, a token is considered highly relevant to\ncertain concepts if there is a large drop in these con-\ncept prediction conﬁdences after erasing the token.\nTherefore, we need the above mentioned concept\nprediction module to provide a reasonable concept\nprediction conﬁdence.\nConcretely, as shown in Figure 2, the eras-\ning mechanism erases the input sequentially, and\nfeeds each erased input into the PLM module\nand the subsequent CP module. For exam-\nple, with xn being substituted by a special to-\nken [UNK], we can obtain an erased input as\n[CLS],x1,··· ,xn−1,[UNK],xn+1,··· ,cK. De-\nnoting ˆpn,k the concept prediction conﬁdence for\nck after erasing xn, we believe the difference be-\ntween ˆpn,k and pk reveals ck’s relevance toxn from\na PLM’s view. The conﬁdence difference∆n,k can\nbe obtained by ∆n,k = lk·max(0,pk −ˆpn,k). Re-\npeating the above procedure on the input question\nsequentially, ∆ ∈RN×K is ﬁlled completely.\n2.3 Awakening Latent Grounding\nAs mentioned above, we believe ∆ reﬂects the\nrelevance between each token and each concept\nfrom a PLM’s view. Therefore, we could directly\nuse ∆ as ETA’s output. However, according to our\npreliminary study, the method performs poorly and\n1177\ncannot produce high-quality alignment2. Different\nfrom directly using ∆, we employ it to “awaken”\nthe latent grounding. To be speciﬁc, we introduce\na grounding module upon representations of the\nPLM module and train it using ∆ as pseudo labels\n(i.e., pseudo alignment). The grounding module\nﬁrst obtains grounding scores gn,k between each\nquestion token xn and each concept ck based on\ntheir deep contextual representations qn and ek as:\ngn,k = Week ·(Wqqn)T\n√\nd\n, (3)\nwhere We,Wq are learnable parameters and dis\nthe dimension ofek. Then it normalizes the ground-\ning scores into latent grounding α as:\nαn,k = exp(gn,k)∑\ni exp(gi,k). (4)\nFinally, the grounding module is trained to maxi-\nmize the likelihood with ∆ as the weight:\n∑\nn\n∑\nk\n∆n,k ·log αn,k. (5)\n2.4 Producing Grounding Pair\nRepeating erasing and awakening iteratively for\nepochs until the grounding module converges, we\ncan readily produce grounding pairs. Formally,\nwe aim to obtain a set of pairs, where each pair\n⟨xn,ck⟩indicates that xn is grounded to ck. Notic-\ning ck may contain several tokens, we keep all\nprobabilities in α·,k which exceeds τ/|ck|, where\nτ is a threshold and |ck|is the number of tokens\nin ck. Also, taking into account that xn should be\ngrounded to only one concept, we keep only the\nhighest probability over αn,·. Finally, for each pair\n⟨xn,ck⟩, it is thought to be a grounding pair ifαn,k\nis kept and pk ≥0.5, otherwise it is not.\n3 Experiments\nIn this section, we conduct experiments to evaluate\nif the latent grounding awakened by ETA is under-\nstandable to human experts. Here we accomplish\nthe evaluation by comparing the grounding pairs\nproduced by ETA with human annotations.\n3.1 Experimental Setup\nDatasets We select two representative ground-\ning tasks where human annotations are available:\nschema linking and entity linking. Schema linking\n2More experimental results can be found in §3.3.\nis to ground questions into database schemas, while\nentity linking is to ground questions into entities\nof knowledge bases. For schema linking, we select\nSPIDER -L (Lei et al., 2020) andSQUALL (Shi et al.,\n2020) as our evaluation benchmarks. As mentioned\nin §2.1, the supervision for our model is obtained\nfrom SQL queries. As for entity linking, we select\nWebQSPELand GraphQEL(Sorokin and Gurevych,\n2018). The supervision for our model is obtained\nfrom SPARQL queries in a similar way.\nEvaluation For schema linking, as done in pre-\nvious work (Lei et al., 2020), we report the micro-\naverage precision, recall and F1-score for both\ncolumns ( ColP , ColR, ColF ) and tables ( TabP ,\nTabR, TabF ). For entity linking, we report the\nweak matching precision, recall and F1-score for\nentities (EntP , EntR, EntF ). The weak matching\nmetric is a commonly used metric in previous work\n(Sorokin and Gurevych, 2018), which considers a\nprediction as correct whenever the correct entity\nis identiﬁed and the predicted mention boundary\noverlaps with the ground truth boundary. More\ndetails can be seen in §A.\nBaselines For schema linking, we consider four\nstrong baselines. (1) N-gram Matching enumer-\nates all n-gram ( n ≤5) phrases in a natural lan-\nguage question, and links them to database schemas\nby fuzzy string matching. (2) SIM computes the\ndot product similarity between each question to-\nken and schema using their PLM representations\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, to explore grounding capaci-\nties of unawakened PLMs. (3) CONTRAST learns\nby comparing the aggregated grounding scores of\nmentioned schemas with unmentioned ones in a\ncontrastive learning style, as done in Liu et al.\n(2020b). Concretely, in training, CONTRAST is\ntrained to accomplish the same concept prediction\ntask as our approach. With a similar architecture\nto the Receiver used in Liu et al.

Unlike our method, these two\nmethods are trained with the full schema linking\nsupervision. Please refer to Shi et al. (2020) and\nLei et al. (2020) for more details. Notably, for\nbaselines which require a threshold, we tuned their\nthresholds based on dev sets for fair comparison.\nFor entity linking, we compare ETA with three\npowerful methods. (1) Heuristic picks the most\nfrequent entity among the candidates found by\nstring matching over Wikidata. (2) VCG (Sorokin\nand Gurevych, 2018) aggregates and mixes con-\ntexts of different granularities to perform en-\ntity linking. (3) ELQ (Li et al., 2020a) uses\na bi-encoder to perform entity linking in one\npass, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nWebQSPELand GraphQEL. VCG and ELQ utilize\nentity linking supervision in training, while ETA\ndoes not.\nImplementation For schema linking we follow\nthe procedure in §2.4 to produce grounding pairs\nto evaluate, while for entity linking we further\nmerge adjacent grounding pairs to produce span-\nlevel grounding pairs. We implement ETA in Py-\ntorch (Paszke et al., 2019).

As for the opti-\nmizer, we employ AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter,\n2019). More details (e.g., learning rate) of each\nexperiment can be found in §C.1.\n3.2 Experimental Results\nTable 1 shows the experimental results on the\nschema linking task. As shown, our method outper-\nforms all weakly supervised methods and heuristic-\nbased methods by a large margin. For example,\non SPIDER -L, ETA + BERT achieves an absolute\nimprovement of 7.2% ColF and 2.8% TabF over\nthe best baseline CONTRAST . The same conclu-\nsion can be drawn from the experimental results\non the entity linking task shown in Table 2. For\ninstance, ETA + BERT can obtain a highEntF up\nto 74.5% on WebQSPEL, which is a satisfying per-\nformance for downstream tasks. All results above\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach on\nawakening latent grounding from PLMs. With\nrespect to the reason that PLMs work well on\nboth schema linking and entity linking, it may be\nbecause both schema linking and entity linking\nrequire text-based semantic matching (e.g., syn-\nonyms), which PLMs excel at.\nFurthermore, it is very surprising that although\nnot trained under ﬁne-grained grounding supervi-\nsion, our model is comparable with or slightly\nworse than the fully supervised models across\n1179\nError Type Example Error\nMissed Grounding (43.1%) How many points did arnaud demare receive?\nGOLD: points→“UCI world tour points” PRED:\nTechnically Correct (21.0%) Total population of millbrook ﬁrst nation?\nGOLD: population→“Population”\nPRED: population→“Population”; nation→“Community”\nPartially Correct (15.8%) Who was the ﬁrst winning captain?\nGOLD: the ﬁrst→“Year”; winning captain→“Winning Captain”\nPRED: ﬁrst→“Year”; winning captain→“Winning Captain”\nWrong Grounding (10.1%) Were the matinee and evening performances held earlier than the 8th anniversary?\nGOLD: earlier→“Date”\nPRED: matinee→“Performance”; earlier→“Date”\nTable 3: Four main error types made by ETA along with their proportions on SQUALL dataset.\ndatasets. For instance, on SPIDER -L, our model ex-\nceeds the fully supervised baseline SLSQLL by 0.9\npoints on TabF . On SQUALL , our model holds a\nslightly worse performance than the fully super-\nvised baseline ALIGN L. It is highly nontrivial\nsince CONTRAST , the best weakly supervised base-\nline on SPIDER -L, is far from the fully supervised\nmodel on SQUALL , while our model has only a\nsmall drop. Besides, on WebQSPELand GraphQEL,\nalthough our model is inferior to the state-of-the-\nart model ELQ, it also achieves a comparable per-\nformance with the fully supervised baseline VCG.\nThese results provide strong evidence that PLMs\ndo have very good grounding capabilities, and our\napproach can awaken them from PLMs.\n3.3 Model Analysis\nIn this section, we try to answer four interesting\nresearch questions via a thorough analysis: RQ1.\nDoes the grounding capability come mainly from\nthe PLM? RQ2. Is the awakening phase neces-\nsary? RQ3. Do larger PLMs have better grounding\ncapabilities? RQ4. What are the remaining errors?\nRQ1 There is a long term debate in literature\nabout if knowledge is primarily learned by PLMs,\nwhen extra parameters are employed in analysis\n(Hewitt and Liang, 2019). Similarly, since our ap-\nproach depends on extra modules (e.g., grounding\nmodule), it faces the same dilemma: how can we\nknow whether the latent grounding is learnt from\nPLMs or extra modules? Therefore, we apply our\napproach to a randomly initialized Transformer en-\ncoder (Vaswani et al., 2017), to probe the ground-\ning capability of a model that has not been pre-\ntrained. To make it comparable, the encoder has\nthe same architecture as BERT. However, it only\ngets a 40% ColF on SQUALL , not even as good\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n15\n30\n45\n60\n75\nAwakeningPseudo AlignmentPseudo w/SoftmaxPseudo w/Sum\nFigure 3: Col F score on the dev set of S QUALL at dif-\nferent training epochs. “Pseudo w/ Softmax” means\nnormalizing pseudo alignment with Softmax, while\n“Pseudo w/ Sum” means normalizing through dividing\neach number by the sum of them.\nas the N-gram baseline. Considering it contains\nthe same extra modules as ETA + BERT, the huge\ngap between it and ETA + BERT supports the opin-\nion that the latent grounding is mainly learnt from\nPLMs. Meanwhile, one concern shared by our re-\nviewers is the risk of supervision exposure during\ntraining of the concept prediction module. In other\nwords, our approach may “steal” some supervision\nin the concept prediction module to achieve good\nperformance on grounding. However, the above ex-\nperiment demonstrates that a non-pretrained model\nis far from strong grounding capability even with\nthe same concept prediction module. We hope the\nﬁnding will alleviate the concern.\nRQ2 As mentioned in§2.3, the pseudo alignment\n∆ can also be employed as the model prediction.\nTherefore, we conduct experiments to verify if our\nproposed awakening phase is necessary. As shown\nin Figure 3, even with various normalization meth-\nods (e.g., Softmax), ∆ does not produce satisfac-\ntory alignment. In contrast, our model consistently\nperforms well. To investigate deeper, we conduct\na careful analysis on ∆, and we are surprised to\n1180\nPLMs\n[CLS]  Find  the  average , maximum and ⋯ movies before 2002 .

Therefore, we believe the success of our\napproach stems from the fact that it encourages the\ngrounding module to capture subtle differences and\nstrength them.\nRQ3 We apply our approach on BERT-large\n(BERTL) and conduct experiments on SPIDER -L.\nThe results show BERTL brings an improvement\nof 2.5% ColF and 0.5% TabF , suggesting the pos-\nsibility of awakening better latent grounding from\nlarger PLMs. Nevertheless, the improvement may\nalso come from more parameters, so the conclusion\nneeds further investigation.\nRQ4 We manually examine 20% of our model’s\nerrors on the SQUALL dataset and summarize four\nmain error types: (1) missed grounding - where our\nmodel did not ground any token to a concept, (2)\ntechnically correct - where our model was techni-\ncally correct but the annotation was missing, (3)\npartially correct - where our model did not ﬁnd all\ntokens of a concept, (4) wrong grounding - where\nthe model produced incorrect grounding. As shown\nin Table 3, only a small fraction of errors are wrong\ngrounding, indicating that the main challenge of\nour approach is recall rather than precision.\n4 Case Study: Text-to-SQL\nThe ETA model is proposed for general-purpose\nuses and intends to enhance different downstream\nsemantic parsing models. To verify it, we take the\ntext-to-SQL task as a case study. In this section, we\nﬁrst present a general solution to couple ETA with\ndifferent text-to-SQL parsers. Then, we conduct\nexperiments on two off-the-shelf parsers to verify\nthe effectiveness of ETA.\n4.1 Coupling with Text-to-SQL Parsers\nInspired by Lei et al. (2020), we present a general\nsolution to couple ETA with downstream parsers in\nModel Dev Test\nEx.Match Ex.Acc Ex.Acc\nALIGNP 37.8 ±0.6 56 .9 ±0.7 46 .6 ±0.5\nALIGNP + BERT 44.7 ±2.1 63 .8 ±1.1 51 .8 ±0.4\nETA + BERT 47.6 ±2.5 66.6 ±1.7 53.8 ±0.3\nALIGN♥ 42.2 ±1.5 61 .3 ±0.8 49 .7 ±0.4\nALIGN + BERT♥ 47.2 ±1.2 66 .5 ±1.2 54 .1 ±0.2\nTable 4: Ex.Match and Ex.Acc results on the dev and\ntest set of WTQ. + BERT means using BERT to en-\nhance encoder. ♥ means the model uses extra schema\nlinking supervision. Both are the same for Table 5.\nFigure 4. As shown, we ﬁrst obtain a schema-aware\nrepresentation for each question token, by fusing\nthe token representation and its related schema\nrepresentation according to the latent grounding\nα∈RN×K (gray matrix in Figure 4). Speciﬁcally,\ngiven a token representation qn and all schema\nrepresentations ⟨e1,e2,..., eK⟩, the schema-aware\nrepresentation ˜qn for qn can be computed as:\n˜qn = qn⊕\n∑\nk\nαn,k ek. (6)\nThen we feed every ˜qn into a question encoder to\ngenerate hidden states, which are attended by a\ndecoder to decode the SQL query. By contributing\nto the schema-aware representation, ETA is able to\nprompt the decoder to predict appropriate schemas\nduring decoding. Notably, the encoder and decoder\nare not limited to speciﬁc modules, and we follow\nthe paper settings in subsequent experiments.\n4.2 Experimental Setup\nDatasets and Evaluation We conduct experi-\nments on two text-to-SQL benchmarks: WikiTable-\nQuestions(WTQ) (Pasupat and Liang, 2015)5 and\nSpider (Yu et al., 2018b). Following previous work,\nwe employ three kinds of evaluation metrics:Exact\nMatch (Ex.Match), Exact Set Match (Ex.Set) and\nExecution Accuracy (Ex.Acc). Ex.Match evaluates\nthe predicted SQL correctness by checking if it\nis equal to the ground-truth, while Ex.Set evalu-\nates the structural correctness by checking the set\nmatch of each SQL clause in the predicted query\nwith respect to the ground-truth. Ex.Acc evaluates\nthe functional correctness of the predicted SQL by\nchecking whether it yields the ground-truth answer.\n5Note that the original WTQ only contains answer anno-\ntations, and here we use the version with SQL annotations\nprovided by Shi et al. (2020). Our training data is a subset of\nthe original train set, while the test data keeps the same.\n1181\nModel Dev Test\nGlobalGNN + BERT (Bogin et al., 2019) 52.7 47 .4\nEditSQL + BERT (Zhang et al., 2019) 57.6 53 .4\nIRNet + BERT (Guo et al., 2019) 61.9 54 .7\nIRNet v2 + BERT (Guo et al., 2019) 63.9 55 .0\nBRIDGE + BERT (Lin et al., 2020) 65.5 59 .2\nBRIDGE + BERTL (Lin et al., 2020) 70.0 65 .0\nRATSQL + BERTL (Wang et al., 2020a) 69.7 65.6\nSLSQLP + BERT 57.4 -\nSLSQLP + BERTL 61.0 -\nETA + BERT 64.5 59 .5\nETA + BERTL 70.8 65.3\nSLSQL + BERT♥ 60.8 55 .7\nSLSQL + BERTL\n♥ 65.1 -\nSLSQL + BERT (Oracle)♥ 72.4 -\nTable 5: Ex.Set results on the dev and test set of Spider.\nBaselines On WTQ, our baselines include\nALIGNP and ALIGN, where the former is a vanilla\nattention based sequence to sequence model and\nthe latter enhances ALIGN P with an additional\nschema linking task (Shi et al., 2020). Similarly,\non Spider, our main baselines are SLSQL P and\nits schema linking enhanced version SLSQL (Lei\net al., 2020). SLSQL P is made up of a question\nencoder and a two-step SQL decoder. In the ﬁrst\ndecoding step, a coarse SQL (i.e., without aggre-\ngation functions) is generated. Then the coarse\nSQL is used to synthesize the ﬁnal SQL in the\nsecond decoding step. Here we also report the per-\nformance of SLSQL + BERT (Oracle), where the\nlearnable schema linking module is replaced with\nhuman annotations in inference. It represents the\nmaximum potential beneﬁt of schema linking for\nthe text-to-SQL task. Meanwhile, for a comprehen-\nsive comparison, we also compare our model with\nstate-of-the-art models on the Spider benchmark6.\nWe refer readers to their papers for details.\nImplementation As for our approach, on WTQ,\nwe employ ALIGNP7 as our base parser, while on\nSpider we select SLSQLP8 as our base parser. For\nboth parsers, we try to follow the same hyperpa-\nrameters as described in the paper to reduce other\nfactors that may affect the performance. More im-\nplementation details can be found in §C.2.\n4.3 Experimental Results\nTable 4 and Table 5 show the experimental re-\nsults of several methods on WTQ and Spider re-\nspectively.

Taking Spider as an illustration, our\nmodel ETA + BERT boosts SLSQLP + BERT by\nan absolute improvement 7.1% on the Ex.Set met-\nric. As the PLM becomes larger (e.g., BERT L),\nthe improvement becomes more signiﬁcant, up to\n9.8%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods,\nour model ETA + BERTL also obtains a competi-\ntive performance, which is extremely impressive\nsince it is based on a simple parser.\nMore interestingly, on both datasets, our model\ncan achieve similar even better performance com-\npared to methods which employ extra grounding\nsupervision. For instance, in comparison with\nSLSQL + BERT on Spider, ourETA + BERT out-\nperforms it by 3.7%. Taking into account that\nSLSQL utilizes additional supervision, the perfor-\nmance gain is very surprising. We attribute the\ngain to two possible reasons: (1) The PLMs already\nlearn latent grounding which is understandable to\nhuman experts. (2) Compared with training with\nstrong schema linking supervision, training with\nweak supervision alleviates the issue of exposure\nbias, and thus enhance the generalization ability of\nETA.\nTable 6 presents the model predictions of\nETA + BERTL on three real cases. As observed,\nETA has learned the grounding about adjec-\ntive (e.g., oldest →age), entity (e.g., where →\nhometown) and semantic matching (e.g.,registered\n→student enrolment). Meanwhile, grounding\npairs provide us a useful guide to better understand\nthe model predictions. Figure 5 visualizes the latent\ngrounding for Q2 in Table 6, and more visualiza-\ntion can be found in §D.\n5 Related Work\nThe most related work to ours is the line of inducing\nor probing knowledge in pretrained language mod-\n1182\nQuestion with Alignment SQL with Alignment\n1.

According to the knowledge category, there\nare mainly two kinds of methods: one focuses on\nsyntactic knowledge and the other pays attention to\nsemantic knowledge. Under the category of syntac-\ntic knowledge, several work showed that BERT em-\nbeddings encoded syntactic information in a struc-\ntural form and can be recovered (Lin et al., 2019b;\nWarstadt and Bowman, 2020; Hewitt and Manning,\n2019; Wu et al., 2020). However, recent work also\nshowed that BERT did not rely on syntactic infor-\nmation for downstream task performance, and thus\ndoubted the role of syntactic knowledge (Ettinger,\n2020; Glavas and Vulic, 2020). As for semantic\nknowledge, although it is less explored than syntac-\ntic knowledge, previous work showed that BERT\ncontained some semantic information, such as en-\ntity types (Ettinger, 2020), semantic roles (Tenney\net al., 2019) and factual knowledge (Petroni et al.,\n2019). Different from the above work, we focus on\nthe grounding capability, an under-explored branch\nof language semantics.\nOur work is also closely related to entity link-\ning and schema linking, which can be viewed as\nsubareas of grounding on speciﬁc scenarios. Given\nan utterance, entity linking aims at ﬁnding all men-\ntioned entities in it using a knowledge base as can-\ndidate pool (Tan et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Li\net al., 2020a), while schema linking tries to ﬁnd\nall mentioned schemas related to speciﬁc databases\n(Dong et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020).\nPrevious work generally either employed full su-\npervision to train linking models (Li et al., 2020a;\nLei et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020), or treated linking\nas a minor pre-processing(Yu et al., 2018a; Guo\net al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019a) and used heuristic\nrules to obtain the result. Our work is different\nfrom them since we optimize the linking model\nwith weak supervision from downstream signals,\nwhich is ﬂexible and practicable. Similarly, Dong\net al. (2019) utilized downstream supervision to\ntrain their linking model. Compared with them us-\ning policy gradient, our method is more efﬁcient\nsince it directly learns the grounding module using\npseudo alignment as supervision.\n6 Conclusion & Future Work\nIn summary, we propose a novel weakly super-\nvised approach to awaken latent grounding from\npretrained language models via erasing. Only with\ndownstream signals, our approach can induce latent\ngrounding from pretrained language models which\nis understandable to human experts. More impor-\ntantly, we demonstrate that our approach could be\napplied to off-the-shelf text-to-SQL parsers and\nsigniﬁcantly improve their performance. For fu-\nture work, we plan to extend our approach to more\ndownstream tasks such as visual question answer-\ning. We also plan to utilize our approach to improve\nthe error locator module in existing interactive se-\nmantic parsing systems (Li et al., 2020b).\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank all the anonymous review-\ners for their constructive feedback and useful com-\nments.

IEEE Computer Society.\n1187\nA Evaluation Details\nA.1 Schema Linking\nLet Ωcol be a set {(c,q)i|1 ≤i≤N}which con-\ntains N gold (column-question token) tuples. Let\nΩcol be a set {(c,q)j|1 ≤j ≤M}which con-\ntains M predicted (column-question token) tuples.\nWe deﬁne the precision( ColP ), recall(ColR), F1-\nscore(ColF ) as:\n|Γcol|⏐⏐Ωcol\n⏐⏐,|Γcol|\n|Ωcol|, 2ColP ColR\nColP + ColR\nwhere Γcol = Ωcol\n⋂Ωcol. The deﬁnitions of TabP ,\nTabR, TabF are similar. Note that the result re-\nported in Table 8 of Shi et al. (2020) use a different\nevaluation metrics. Here we re-evaluate their model\nby the above mentioned metrics for fair compari-\nson.\nA.2 Entity Linking\nLet Ω = {(e,[qs,qe])i|1 ≤i ≤N}be the gold\nentity-mention set and Ω = {(e,[qs,qe])j|1 ≤j ≤\nM}be the predicted entity-mention set, where e\nis the entity, qe,qs are the mention boundaries in\nthe question q. In the weak matching setting, a\nprediction is correct only if the ground-truth entity\nis identiﬁed and the predicted mention boundaries\noverlap with the ground-truth boundaries. There-\nfore, the True-Positive prediction set is deﬁned as:\nΓ = {e|(e,[qs,qe]) ∈Ω,(e,[qs,qe]) ∈Ω,\n[qs,qe]\n⋂\n[qs,qe] ̸= ∅}.\nThe corresponding precision( EntP ), recall(EntR)\nand F1(EntF ) are:\n|Γ|⏐⏐Ω\n⏐⏐,|Γ|\n|Ω|, 2EntP EntR\nEntP + EntR\nB Dataset Statistic\nAll details of datasets used in this paper are shown\nin Table 7.\nC Implementation Details\nFor all experiments, we employ the AdamW opti-\nmizer and the default learning rate schedule strat-\negy provided by Transformers library (Wolf et al.,\n2020).\nC.1 Experiments on Grounding\nSQUALL We use uncased BERT-base as the en-\ncoder. The learning rate is 3 ×10−5. The training\nepoch is 50 with a batch size of 16. The dropout\nrate and the threshold τ are set to 0.3 and 0.2 re-\nspectively. The training process lasts 6 hours on a\nsingle 16GB Tesla P100 GPU.\nSPIDER -L We implement two versions: uncased\nBERT-base and uncased BERT-large. For both ver-\nsions, the learning rate is 5 ×10−5 and the training\nepoch is 50. For BERT-base (BERT-large) version,\nthe batch size and gradient accumulation step are\nset to 12 (6) and 6 (4). The dropout rate and the\nthreshold τ are set to 0.3 and 0.2 respectively. As\nfor training time, BERT-base (BERT-large) version\nis trained on a 24GB Tesla P40 and it takes about\n16 (48) hours to ﬁnish the training process.\nWebQSPEL& GraphQ EL Due to the large\namount of entity candidates, we ﬁrst use the can-\ndidate retrieval method proposed in (Sorokin and\nGurevych, 2018) to reduce the number of candi-\ndates. After that, we still can not feed all candidates\nalong with the question due to the maximum encod-\ning length of BERT. Therefore, we divide the can-\ndidates into multiple chunks and feed each chunk\n(along with the question) into BERT sequentially.\nIn implementation, we use uncased BERT-base\nas the encoder. The learning rate is 1 ×10−5 The\ntraining epoch is 50 with a batch size of 16. The\ndropout rate and the threshold τ are set to 0.3 and\n0.3 respectively. The training procedure ﬁnishes\nwithin 10 hours on a single Tesla M40 GPU.\nC.2 Experiments on Text-to-SQL\nFor experiments of the text-to-SQL task, we em-\nploy the ofﬁcial code released along with Shi et al.\n(2020) (on WTQ) and Lei et al. (2020) (on Spi-\nder). When coupling ETA with these models, we\nﬁrst produce a one-hot grounding matrix derived\nby grounding pairs and then feed it into them as\ndescribed in §4.\nWTQ We use uncased BERT-base as the encoder.\nThe training epoch is 50 with a batch size of 8. The\nlearning rate is 1 ×10−5 for the BERT module and\n1 ×10−3 for other modules. The dropout rate is\nset to 0.2. The training process ﬁnishes within 16\nhours on a single 16GB Tesla P100 GPU.\nMeanwhile, we follow the previous work (Shi\net al., 2020) to employ 5-fold cross-validation, and\n1188\nDataset Train Dev Test\n#Q #C #Q #C #Q #C\nSQUALL 9,030 19 ,185 2 ,246 4 ,774 – –\nSPIDER -L 7,000 28 ,848 1 ,034 4 ,360 – –\nWTQ 9,030 – 2,246 – 4,344 –\nSpider 7,000 – 1,034 – 2,147 –\nWebQSPEL 2,974 3 ,242 – – 1,603 1 ,806\nGraphQEL 2,089 2 ,253 – – 2,075 2 ,229\nTable 7: Statistics for all datasets used in our experiments.
