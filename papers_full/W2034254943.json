  "abstract": "A transmission line transformer (TLT)-based multiple-switch circuit topology was recently proposed for pulsed-power generation. By means of a TLT, multiple spark-gap switches can be synchronized in a short time (ns). It is attractive to be used to design a long-lifetime repetitive large pulsed-power source (100kW, 1kHz) for various kinds of applications, such as corona plasma-induced gas cleaning. To gain insight into the synchronization principle and switching behavior of the individual switch, an equivalent circuit model was developed and an experimental setup with two spark-gap switches and a two-stage TLT has been constructed. We observed that in terms of switching currents, the two switches can be synchronized within 2–3ns. The equivalent circuit model approximately fits the experimental results.",
