    "abstract": "Pulsed power loads (PPLs) are commonly incorporated in medium voltage dc microgrids on naval vessels. To mitigate their detrimental effects, dedicated energy storage systems can be installed and their converters need to have excellent disturbance rejection capability. To facilitate this objective, a moving-discretized-control-set model-predictive-control (MDCS-MPC) is proposed in this letter and applied on a dual-active-bridge converter. Fixed switching frequency is maintained, enabling easy passive components design. The proposed MDCS-MPC has a small number of calculating points in each switching period, which enables the implementation in standard commercial control platforms. The operating principle of the MDCS-MPC is introduced in development of a cost function that, on one hand, provides stiff voltage regulation; on the other hand, minimizes transformer current stress online. Theoretical claims are verified on a 20 kHz 1 kW dual active bridge.",
