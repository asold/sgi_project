Traditionally, the design of organic molecules has been the exclusive domain of experimental \nscientists5. The complexity of the molecular design often necessitates costly trial-and-error methodologies \nand typically requires the expertise of seasoned organic chemists6. To resolve this issue with the leverage \nof big data, various de novo molecular design methodologies have been developed7,8. While these \nalgorithms can process a lot of molecules that are unachievable by experiments, human intuition still \nsurpasses computationally generated molecules9,10. The ideal story would be the effective collaboration \nof human and de novo molecular design workflow, which has been gathering attention recently11. \nOne promising platform to realize effective human-machine collaboration would be large language \nmodels (LLMs)12–14. LLMs are machine learning models that have been trained on a diverse range of \ninternet text. They are proficient in generating human-like text based on the given text15. Some of the most \nadvanced LLMs, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 developed by OpenAI15,16 as well as Bard or Gemini \ndeveloped by Google17,18, have shown remarkable performance in a wide array of tasks, including \ntranslation, question answering, and even generating creative content3. These models have gained \nconsiderable attention due to their capacity to engage in diverse discussions with humans, ranging from \ngeneral topics to specialized subjects19. The application of LLMs presents a significant opportunity to \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n2 \n \npropel scientific research forward, providing innovative techniques for exploring and interpreting complex \ndata and theoretical concepts20,21. Because LLMs allow users to interact easily via natural language, it is \nnatural to assume that they have the potential to become a great platform for realizing human–machine \ncollaboration for designing targeted molecules. \nThe implementation of LLMs in the fields of materials science and chemistry has already begun. Recent \nstudies have demonstrated the application of LLMs in guiding the synthesis of metal–organic frameworks, \ncircumventing costly trial-and-error experimentation20,21. This highlights the potential of LLMs in \nmaterials synthesis. Bajorath et al. have developed a generative chemical language model to predict highly \npotent compounds from less potent ones as input for drug discovery22. Priyakumar et al. enabled a \ntransformer-decoder model named MolGPT inspired by GPT models to generate drug-like molecules23. \nWhile their studies employed highly customized language models specifically trained to generate \nchemical compounds, we postulated that general-purpose LLMs such as GPT and Gemini would perform \nwell in designing potent molecules, without further extensive training. \nOur target for molecular design is organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) for zeolites. OSDAs, \ntypically quaternary ammonium cations, facilitate the crystallization of zeolites24. Zeolites are porous \ncrystalline aluminosilicates with diverse polymorph structures, each with unique channels and cavities. \nOSDAs can stabilize the specific shape of the inner structure of zeolites25–28, enabling the crystallization \nof zeolites, including previously unknown ones29–32. Furthermore, the replacement of OSDAs with \ncheaper ones is also an interesting topic to study33, as a significant fraction of the cost of the production \nof zeolites is occupied by OSDAs34. \nThere are molecular design algorithms for the prediction of potent OSDAs for zeolites35–39 and some of \nthem are confirmed experimentally. One of the first de novo molecular design algorithms of OSDAs was \nreported by Lewis et al., where a stochastic algorithm lets compounds grow in the cages of CHA and MFI \nzeolites35. To predict the synthesizable OSDAs, Deem et al. used a genetic algorithm for purchasable \nreagents and well-documented chemical reactions36. Recently, a nature-inspired meta-heuristic approach \nwas employed to perform multi-objective optimization for affinity and cost of OSDAs for syntheses of \ntargeted zeolites37. A generator based on a self-attention mechanism and long and short-term memory \nnetworks was used to design potent OSDAs38. \nIn this study, we developed a workflow using a general-purpose, pre-trained LLM, GPT-4. Our \nmethodology involves feedback to GPT-4 based on the affinity scores and empirical screening criteria to \nmimic the human-machine collaboration using the natural language, fostering improved subsequent \nsuggestions, and ultimately achieving the prediction of highly potent OSDAs. This workflow \ndemonstrates the possibility of the human-machine collaboration of the molecular design, which could \nopen new avenues in developing pharmaceuticals and other complex molecular compounds.  \nResults & Discussion \nGPT-4 in molecular design \nPrevious research has encountered challenges in facilitating effective collaboration between humans and \nmachines in the realm of molecular design. Addressing this issue, our study explores using LLMs to \nnarrow this gap through natural language. We first assessed the capability of LLMs to comprehend and \nmanipulate chemical structures. To this end, we asked GPT-4—a leading-edge LLM created by OpenAI—\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n3  \nto generate new OSDAs from the basic OSDA, tetraethylammonium (TMA) via natural language and SMILES notation40 (see Table S1 for the exact conversation). GPT-4 responded by generating five SMILES strings representing TMA derivatives, each adorned with additional functional groups, thereby demonstrating its potential as a tool for molecular generation. To further explore how we can guide the LLM to the desired direction of the molecular design, we instructed GPT-4 to incorporate a carbon ring into its outputs. In response, GPT-4 provided five different candidates with carbon rings. This confirmed that GPT-4 can not only generate molecular structures but also refine them based on guidance provided via natural-language dialogue, showcasing its value in human-machine collaborative efforts in molecular design. GPT-4 determines the likelihood of the subsequent token based on the prompt or the preceding token it generated during text production41. If it only opts for tokens with high probability, the result is deterministic and not stochastic, which means that the generated texts become precise but not very far away from the given texts. Conversely, if it opts for tokens with low probability, the result becomes more stochastic42,43. More “creative” text is generated in this case, while information and even grammar become far away from the given texts. This deterministic-stochastic tradeoff is regulated by temperature, which is a common parameter in related text generation models. Selecting the right temperature is thus crucial for controlling the operation of GPT-4 as desired.   To examine how GPT-4 behaves differently with temperature when dealing with molecular data, we provided GPT-4 with a few OSDAs using a notation called SMILES and asked it to generate new molecules. This was repeated to obtain a total of 100 molecules. The exact prompt is shown in Figure S1. Shape and/or size descriptors on OSDAs are useful tools to predict the structure-directing ability44. We applied shoebox algorithm45 (Figure 1a) to the input OSDAs and output OSDAs. Figure 1b–e visualizes the input and output OSDAs using them being D1, the maximum distance in each molecule, and D2, \nFigure 1. S h o e b o x  p a r a m e t e rs of input OSDAs and candidates generated by GPT-4 with different temperatures. a.

D3 is orthogonal to D1 and D2. b–e. Input OSDAs (orange) were supplied to GPT-4 to generate new OSDAs (grey) at temperatures of 0.3 (b), 0.7 (c), 1.1 (d), and 1.5 (e). \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

When the temperature was set to 0.3, GPT-4 generated molecules slightly different from input molecules, as shown in Figure 1b and Figure S2. A noticeable number of duplicated molecules were generated in this case. When the temperature was increased to 0.7, more diverse molecules were generated from the identical inputs, as apparent from the spread data points in Figure 1c. As the temperature increased further to 1.1 and 1.5, more and more diverse outputs were obtained (Figure 1d, e and Figure S2). This observation is consistent with the fact that the higher temperature leads to more stochastic responses47. Upon the above test, we observed that some SMILES strings produced by GPT-4 could not be parsed, particularly at elevated temperatures. A similar phenomenon, so-called hallucination, has been documented in text generation by GPT-4: as the temperature escalates, the text becomes excessively nonsensical and approaches a random character sequence48. To quantitatively examine how temperature affects the correctness of the syntax of SMILES, we measured the fraction of parsable SMILES in 100 texts generated by GPT-4 under different temperatures, across three independent trials. We further calculated the average and standard error of each temperature. As shown in Figure 2a, more than 80% of generated strings obey the syntax of SMILES at temperatures up to 1.3. As the temperature increased further, the fraction of parsable SMILES dramatically decreased. At the temperature of 2.0, we frequently observed nonsensical texts. These results suggest that low temperatures are required to obtain reliable results. Another observation in the preliminary experiment in Figure 1 was that too low temperature led to a significant number of SMILES duplicating with inputs or outputs, which can lead to inefficient exploration of the chemical space. To examine how temperature affects the uniqueness of the generated molecules, we counted the number of unique molecules from the three runs. As shown in Figure 2b, only 20% of the generated molecules were unique at temperatures less than 0.3. As the temperature increased, the fraction of unique entries increased (Figure 2b). The peak of the unique rate was the temperature of 1.5. Above that, the number of unique entries started to decrease, due to the hallucination effect observed in Figure 2b.  Collectively, we chose the temperature range from 0.7 to 1.1 for developing our de novo molecular design workflow, considering the tradeoff between the correctness and the novelty of the generated texts shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, which resembles the exploration-exploitation trade-off49.  De novo molecular design workflow Figure 3 provides the overview of our de novo molecular design workflow, which incorporates elements such as GPT-4, prescreening filters, atomistic simulation, and a database. The data stored within the database encompasses the SMILES notation for the molecule and the corresponding stabilization energy \nFigure 2. a. The fraction of parsable SMILES generated by GPT-4 with different temperature values. b. The fraction of unique OSDAs generated by GPT-4 with different temperature values. The error bars represent the standard errors among three independent runs. \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

The algorithm retrieves the top 10 entries among 100 recent records from the database and formulates a prompting text to instruct GPT-4 to generate potential molecules. The precise prompt is depicted in Figure S3. The formulated text is then submitted to GPT-4. To initiate the workflow, tetramethylammonium (TMA), one of the simplest OSDAs, and its stabilization energy were prepared as the first input data. In response, GPT-4 generates candidate SMILES-like strings as requested. These strings are parsed and subjected to a series of empirical filtering criteria to eliminate candidates unsuitable as OSDAs for zeolites. The criteria check rigidity/flexibility, stability, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. It has been found that the rigidity/flexibility influences the structure-directing ability. In particular, OSDAs with an excessive number of degrees of freedom may adopt multiple configurations during the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites, thereby reducing the selectivity50,51. To avoid them, we precluded the molecules containing many rotatable bonds and too large rings. Zeolites are typically synthesized under hydrothermal conditions52–55 so that OSDA needs sufficient stability. Molecules containing a N-ring with triple bonds may be unsuitable for hydrothermal synthesis. If the compounds contain rings with fewer than five members, the steep bond angle could potentially break the ring. We exploited these properties to assess chemical stability. It is established that a balance of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity is vital for OSDAs to promote the crystallization of zeolites in aqueous media. This is because OSDAs require sufficient hydrophilicity to be dissolved in water, and they also need to interact with the relatively hydrophobic aluminosilicate \nFigure 3. Schematic illustration of the computational workflow. TMA (C[N+](C)(C)C) is chosen as the first input data. GPT-4 generates new OSDAs based on the input OSDAs and corresponding stabilization energies. Some of the generated OSDAs are rejected by the screening, and their reasons are fed to GPT-4. Screened molecules are docked in the inner space of a specific zeolite for calculation of their affinity. If the structure of the zeolite–OSDA complex is reasonable, the OSDA and the calculated stabilization energy are stored in a database. 10 molecules and corresponding stabilization energies out of 100 recent records in a database are used to update the input data. \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

We limit the C/N ratio from 4 to 20. We restrict the permissible elements in OSDAs to those typically observed—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This is done to ensure the effectiveness of the C/N ratio in evaluating hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (see details in Table S2).  The rejected entries by the above screening criteria along with the reasons for the rejection are then sent back to GPT-4. This process mimics the human-machine interaction in molecular design. GPT-4 is then asked to generate new candidates based on the feedback. This step is repeated up to five times according to the preliminary testing (Figure S4).  Molecules that meet the prescreening criteria undergo atomistic simulation to assess their affinity against the targeted zeolite. We use stabilization energy as the metric to evaluate this affinity, a common indicator for assessing potential OSDAs for targeted zeolites58–60.  𝐸s=𝐸complex−𝐸zeolite−𝑛 𝐸OSDA  (1) 𝐸complex represents the energy of complex of the zeolite with the OSDA inside of its cages, 𝐸zeolite a n d   𝐸OSDA are the energy of the vacant zeolite and the isolated OSDA respectively, and 𝑛 is number of OSDAs in the unit cell of the zeolite. We set 𝑛 = 3 in this study. The “frozen pose” method,61,62 a s  recommended by a previous study63, is utilized, where the structure of relaxed zeolite–OSDA complex was directly used to calculate 𝐸complex, 𝐸zeolite, and 𝐸OSDA to assess the stabilization energy. This method, however, occasionally distorts the zeolite frameworks unrealistically, leading to significant under- or over-estimation of the stabilization energy. To avoid this, we dismiss any zeolite–OSDA complexes with excessive atomic displacement (see the Computational Methods section for details). Candidates that passed this criterion were stored in the database for subsequent runs. Designing OSDAs for AEI, CHA, and ITE The trajectory of the optimization Figure 4.

License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n7 \n \nOur de novo molecular design methodology was applied to three cage-type zeolites: CHA, AEI, and ITE \n(Figure S6), which are frequently used structures in demonstrating de novo molecular design for \nOSDAs36,37,64–66.  \nTemperatures play a crucial role in balancing the deterministic and stochastic behavior of GPT-4, as \ndiscussed earlier. We evaluated our workflow at three temperatures: 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1. Figure 4a shows the \nlowest stabilization energy at each step of the runs for AEI. A temperature of 0.7 yielded a slower \nimprovement in stabilization energy, likely due to the deterministic nature of lower temperatures. \nIncreasing the temperature to 0.9 resulted in a steep initial improvement in stabilization energy, likely due \nto the increased stochastic nature of GPT-4. The most negative stabilization energy for the entire run at a \ntemperature of 0.9 was more negative than that of 0.7, indicating that the higher temperature improved \nthe results. At the higher temperature of 1.1, a steep initial improvement was observed akin to the \ntemperature of 0.9. This temperature resulted in the OSDA with more negative stabilization energy than \nthe other temperatures. \nHigher temperatures do not necessarily yield OSDAs with higher affinity. For CHA, all three temperature \nruns exhibited similar initial profiles (Figure 4b), with the best OSDA achieved at 0.9, neither the highest \nnor the lowest temperature. The sensitivity towards temperatures of GPT-4 was more evident with ITE \n(Figure 4c). At temperatures of 0.7 and 0.9, the trajectories were similar, achieving stabilization energies \naround −10 kJ molSi−1. Increasing the temperature to 1.1 generated OSDAs with more negative \nstabilization energies of approximately −20 kJ molSi−1, indicating that temperature effects are highly \nsystem-dependent. \nWhile the optimal temperatures vary among targeted zeolites, the necessity for parameter tuning to achieve \noptimal results can be disadvantageous. To address this, we randomly selected a temperature from 0.7, \n0.9, and 1.1 each time we asked queries to GPT-4. The grey solid lines in Figure 4 show the trajectory of \nthe best stabilization energies. This stochastic scheme, as shown in the figure, demonstrated comparable \nor superior performance to the other conditions, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation by \nGPT-4 at different temperatures. \nSuggested OSDA candidates \nFigure 5 shows some OSDAs predicted by our de novo molecular design workflow under varying \ntemperature conditions. GPT-4 successfully generated several OSDAs that are identical or closely \nresembling experimentally validated OSDAs. OSDAs 1, 3, and 8 are identical to those known from \nexperimental studies of corresponding zeolites66–68. Predicted candidates 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 15, and 16 \ndemonstrate structural similarities to known OSDAs 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28, respectively57,64,66 \n(see Figure S5). For example, OSDA 10 has one fewer methyl group than 25 (Figure S5); 9 and 16 possess \nan extra methyl group compared to 24 and 35 (Figure S5). \nSome generated candidates exhibited superior stabilization energies compared to experimentally proven \nOSDAs. 5, 6, and 7 showed sufficiently negative stabilization energies for AEI comparable to \nexperimentally proven OSDAs (Figure S5). For CHA, 12, 1 3, and 14 displayed stabilization energies \nbetter than known ones, likely due to their slightly larger size. While the runs of ITE successfully \npredicted piperidine-based OSDAs including experimentally verified ones such as 1 and 3, it also \nidentified promising candidates exhibiting more negative stabilization energies. Particularly, it expanded \nits exploration to include OSDAs containing benzene rings such as 17, 18, and 19. Despite the lack of \nbenzene rings in the experimentally validated OSDAs, the relatively large cavity in ITE seems to have \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n8  \ngreat compatibility with OSDAs with benzene rings. This compatibility merits future experimental investigation. We presume this contributed to the difference in the trajectory of best stabilization energies (Figure 4). While under lower temperatures, the probability of generating OSDAs with benzene rings seems to be low, at a higher temperature of 1.1, such OSDAs can easily be generated to achieve more negative stabilization energy. A limitation of the current prediction regarding the experimental validation is the potential synthesizability of OSDA candidates because prescreening criteria did not consider it, and GPT-4 was not asked to take it into account. The difficulty in computer-aided synthesis planning is well-established within the scientific literature, even when utilizing specialized algorithms69,70. To ascertain if LLMs could aid in computer-aided retrosynthesis, we asked GPT-4 to estimate the synthesis pathways for experimentally validated OSDAs, as depicted in Table S3. While GPT-4 correctly identified a synthesis pathway of the simplest OSDA, TMA, it did not successfully estimate the pathway for 1. This may be attributed to the dearth of information on the organic synthesis pathway in the training data of GPT-4. It would be interesting to study LLMs for data-driven retrosynthesis through the specialized LLMs or by more general-purpose models with post-training. Dimensionality reduction   \nFigure 5.

Experimentally validated OSDAs for each zeolite type are marked with an asterisk. The first three on the left for each zeolite type correspond to known or highly similar OSDAs, while the remaining candidates exhibit favorable stabilization energies. \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n9  To better understand the nature of explored OSDAs, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) for descriptors of OSDAs for all of the suggested molecules as well as experimentally known OSDAs44 that pass our prescreening criteria, as shown in Figure 6. Considering that the shape, size, and rigidity/flexibility of OSDAs significantly affect zeolite crystallization24,71,72, we calculated molecular descriptors including volume, number of atoms (N), number of rotatable bonds, number of rings, number of benzene rings, number of atoms creating branches, and geometrical parameters (D1, D2, D3, and (D1 × D2 × D3) × N) derived from the shoebox algorithm (Figure 1a)45. The explained variance values of the principal components (PCs) confirm that PC1, PC2, and PC3 adequately captured most of the variance in data (Figure S6a). After carefully examining the elements of the PCs as detailed in Figure S6b, we found that PC1 describes the overall size of OSDAs; OSDAs with larger PC2 show high aspect ratios; OSDAs with larger value of PC3 is closely related to rigid property. As shown in Figure 6a, our de novo molecular design workflow using GPT-4 explored a vast chemical space covering the plots of experimentally proven OSDAs for AEI, CHA, and ITE. We extracted top \nFigure 6. a. PCA for suggested and experimentally proven OSDAs for CHA, AEI, and ITE z e o l i t e stogether with Gaussian kernel density estimates of PCs. All suggested OSDA candidates are scattered in gray color on the PCA maps. TMA, the starting OSDA in our workflow, is also plotted. The top 15% of suggested candidates based on stabilization energy are denoted as circles with respective colors. Experimentally proven OSDAs are represented as triangles, with each color corresponding to a specific zeolite. Two kinds of Gaussian kernel density estimates of distributions are depicted. One describes the top 15% of explored OSDA candidates, and the other shows experimentally proven OSDAs. b.

License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n10 \n \n15% of the generated OSDAs in terms of the stabilization energy for each zeolite. The distributions of \nPCs for these OSDAs with high affinity is highly consistent with the experimentally proven OSDAs, \nsuggesting the validity of our approach. The capability of the LLM pretrained against the large number of \ninternet texts and provided feedback informed by empirical screening criteria and stabilization energies \neffectively enable the workflow to produce reasonable candidates using only the structure of the simplest \nOSDA as a starting point. The adaptive exploration and exploitation process can be visualized using the \nPCA map as shown in Figure S7. At first, GPT-4 predominantly sampled points close to the initial OSDA, \nTMA. As the process advanced, GPT-4 increasingly explored more diverse regions of the chemical space, \nas depicted in Figure S7. \nA noticeable point in Figure 6a is that PC2 is divided into two clusters. The figure shows that the cluster \nwith high PC2 was explored to generate effective OSDAs for ITE. The thorough investigation of the \nconstituting OSDAs reveals that this cluster is for benzene-containing OSDAs characterized by high \naspect ratios, such as 17, 18, and 19 in Figure 5. These points are sampled at the later stages of the runs \nfor ITE, as depicted in Figure S7 and Figure 6a. Furthermore, promising OSDAs for ITE tend to have \nlarger PC1 and PC3 (Figure 6a), indicating that bulkier and more rigid OSDAs are effective for ITE. To \nfill and stabilize relatively large cages in ITE, depicted in Figure 6b, OSDAs need to be bulkier and more \nrigid, as suggested earlier66,73,74.  \nOSDAs effective for CHA and AEI overlap in the PCA map (Figure 6a), presumably due to the similar \nsize of cages in the two zeolites75 (Figure 6b). For both the top 15% of the generated OSDA candidates \nand experimentally proven OSDAs, OSDAs for CHA exhibit marginally elevated values in PC1 and PC3, \nalongside reduced values in PC2, compared to AEI counterparts (Figure 6a). This suggests that the cage \nfor AEI favors smaller, flatter, and more flexible OSDAs, while CHA favors bulkier, more spherical, and \nmore rigid ones. To effectively fill the avocado-like uneven cages in AEI (Figure 6b), OSDAs with more \nrotational freedom can be advantageous64.  \nThese results confirm that the general-purpose LLM successfully sampled the chemical space covering \nexisting OSDAs with similar distribution, recommending the candidates with properties and affinity \ntailored to each zeolite. \nConclusion \nPrior studies documented de novo molecular design algorithms tailored for diverse applications. Despite \nthe advanced development of algorithms and the vast amount of data available, the effective integration \nof computationally generated data by chemists remains a significant challenge. Consequently, molecular \ndesign continues to rely heavily on experimental trial and error. In this study, we focused on general-\npurpose LLMs to demonstrate the potential human-machine collaboration through natural language and \nchemical notation to design novel molecules, specifically OSDAs for synthesizing zeolites. \nOur de novo molecular design framework using an LLM can efficiently explore the chemical space for \nOSDAs under appropriate temperature parameters. The feedback provided in natural language, stemming \nfrom empirical knowledge, along with affinity scores derived from atomistic simulations, effectively \nsteers the LLM toward identifying more viable candidates. This highlights the strong capability of LLM \nto design novel molecules. Owing to the extensive pretraining of the general-purpose LLM, it can propose \nto add various functional groups not in the starting OSDA. This feature will benefit from transferring \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

This paves the way for future collaborations \nbetween humans and machines in molecular design, utilizing natural language as the communication \ninterface. \nComputational Methods \nDataset \nStructures of pure silica zeolites were obtained from the International Zeolite Association76. The \nexperimentally verified OSDAs for the AEI, CHA, and ITE zeolites were acquired from the OSDB \ndatabase44. \nLLM \nWe utilized GPT-4 via an API developed by OpenAI. The queries were performed between June 26th \n2023 and March 11th 2023. The exact prompts are shown in Figure S1, S3, and S4 and Table S2 \nPrescreening \nGPT-4 sometimes produces candidates that are not as viable as OSDAs. We rejected such candidates by \napplying empirical screening criteria. The properties of OSDAs were calculated by RDKit software77. The \ncomplete list of screening criteria is presented in Table S2 To avoid too flexible candidates, the number \nof rotatable bonds was restricted to less than 5, and bridge-free rings larger than the nine-membered ring \nwere rejected. To avoid candidates unstable under hydrothermal conditions, we rejected the candidates \nwith rings smaller than the five-membered ring, NH+ group, NH3+ group, and rings having nitrogen and \ntriple bonds. Furthermore, if rings with N possessed bonds in conjugated systems (one-and-a-half bonds) \nand/or double bonds, it would not be included if it met the empirically determined equation37.  \n3𝑛2 + 4.5𝑛3 ≥𝑛1 (2) \nWhere 𝑛ଵ, 𝑛ଶ, and 𝑛ଷ represent the count of single bonds, one-and-a-half bonds, and double bonds in \nthe ring, respectively. We also rejected candidates with unconventional atoms and restricted C/N ratio as \ndescribed above. \nAtomistic modeling \nProposed OSDA candidates were optimized by means of the universal force field (UFF) as implemented \nin RDKit software77. The location and rotation of OSDAs in a zeolite were determined by Bayesian \noptimization with the following objective function. \n𝜃=𝑛1.1×1 017+𝑛1.3×1 014+𝑛1.5× 1012+𝑛1.7×1 010 (3) \n𝑛1.1, 𝑛1.3, 𝑛1.5, and 𝑛1.7 represent the number of interatomic distances between zeolite and OSDAs under \nspecific distance thresholds of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7 Å, respectively. The resulting zeolite–OSDA complex \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

If the algorithm is unable to determine that a zeolite in an optimized \ncomplex is equivalent to its corresponding zeolite before optimization, it is subsequently rejected. \nMolecular descriptors \nThree-dimensional coordinates of a candidate OSDA, as obtained by UFF, were subjected the shoebox \nalgorithm45 to calculate D1, D2, D3, and the size descriptor, (D1 + D2 + D3) × N, where N is the number of \natoms. First, maximum interatomic distances in a candidate OSDA were found and defined as distance \nD1. The candidate was rotated to define a new plane perpendicular to the axis along with D1. On the new \nplane, the two atoms of maximum distance were obtained to define the distance D2. From these two axes \nalong with D1 and D2, we created a new axis, which we defined as D3, denoting the maximum interatomic \ndistance along with it. RDKit calculated the other molecular descriptors. The molecular descriptors \nunderwent standard scaling and PCA as implemented in the scikit-learn package. \nAcknowledgments \nThis work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI (22K14751) and JST PRESTO (JPMJPR2378). \nReferences \n(1) Gurung, A.

The cumulative explained variance reached over 80 % with PC1, PC2, and PC3. b. Contribution ratio of the variables for PC1, PC2, and PC3. As for PC1, all variables yield positive contributions, with benzene and rotatable bonds making a notably small proportion of this contribution. It is important to understand that the molecular shape does not significantly vary with differences in PC1, as the ratios of distances D1, D2, and D3 remain largely unchanged. This indicates that PC1 predominantly reflects the bulkiness or the overall size of the OSDA molecules rather than their shape, with an elongation mainly observed when D1 is significantly larger and a flatter conformation primarily associated with a smaller D3 value. In contrast, PC2's number of benzene rings and rotatable bonds substantially impact its value. The distinction here is further emphasized by the observation that D1 positively correlates with PC2, whereas D3 exhibits a large negative contribution, suggesting that OSDAs associated with larger PC2 values can adopt flatter or more elongated shapes within their respective cages. Lastly, PC3 is significantly influenced by the negative contribution of the number of rotatable bonds and positively by the number of rings and benzenes, indicating that this value signifies the rigidify of OSDAs.    \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

And the SMILES are \nOSDAs for CHA zeolite. \nC[N+](C)(C)C \nPredict the 5 new OSDAs for CHA. \nAs an AI, I don't have the capability to predict new OSDAs \ndirectly. However, I can suggest a few modifications based on \ncommon chemical substitutions to the given SMILES string, \nwhich represents a quaternary ammonium cation. Please \nconsult with a chemist or use a chemical prediction software \nfor accurate results. Here are some variations: \n1. \"C[N+](C)(C)CC\" - Adding an extra methyl group to the \nnitrogen. \n2. \"C[N+](C)(CC)C\" - Substituting one of the methyl groups \nwith an ethyl group. \n3. \"C[N+](CC)(C)C\" - Substituting one of the methyl groups \nwith an ethyl group in a different position. \n4. \"CC[N+](C)(C)C\" - Adding an extra methyl group to the \ncarbon. \n5. \"C[N+](C)(C)COC\" - Adding a methoxy group to the \nnitrogen. \nRemember, these are just structural modifications and may \nnot necessarily result in effective OSDAs for CHA zeolite. \nOSDA suitable for CHA tends to have a carbon ring. \nCould you improve on your proposed OSDAs? \nI see, thank you for the information. Here are some SMILES \nstrings with carbon rings that might be suitable as OSDAs for \nCHA zeolite: \n1. \"C1CC[N+](C)(C)CC1\" - A nitrogen-containing seven-\nmembered ring. \n2. \"C1CC[N+](C)CC1C\" - A nitrogen-containing six-\nmembered ring with a methyl group. \n3. \"C1CC[N+](C)(C)C1C\" - A six-membered ring with a \nnitrogen and an extra methyl group. \n4. \"C1CC[N+](C)(C)CC1\" - A seven-membered ring with a \nnitrogen. \n5. \"C1CCC[N+](C)(C)C1\" - A seven-membered ring with a \nnitrogen and an extra carbon in the ring. \nAgain, please consult with a chemist or use a chemical \nprediction software for accurate results. \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n11 \n \nTable S3. Estimation of synthetic pathways by GPT-4. \n \n  \nQuestion Answer \nYou are a seasoned organic chemist. Suggest a \nsynthesis pathway to get C[N+](C)(C)C using \ncommercially available reagents. It should end within \ntwo steps. You may use Menshutkin reaction. \nTo synthesize C[N+](C)(C)C, also known as \nTetramethylammonium ion, you can use the Menshutkin \nreaction, which involves the reaction of a tertiary amine with \nan alkyl halide to form a quaternary ammonium salt. \nHere's a simple two-step synthesis pathway: \n**Step 1:** Start with Trimethylamine (N(CH3)3), which is a \ncommercially available reagent. \n**Step 2:** Perform a Menshutkin reaction by reacting the \nTrimethylamine with Methyl Iodide (CH3I). This will add a \nmethyl group to the nitrogen, forming Tetramethylammonium \niodide ([N+]IC)(C)C.[I-]), which contains the desired \nTetramethylammonium ion.The reaction can be represented \nas follows: \nN(CH3)3 + CH3I -> [N+](C)(C)(C)C.[I-] \nPlease take note that this reaction should be performed in a \nsuitable solvent (like ethanol) under controlled conditions \n(room temperature), as it is exothermic and can lead to \nviolent reactions if not properly managed. Also, the resulting \nTetramethylammonium iodide should be handled with care as \nit is a strong irritant and harmful if swallowed or inhaled. \nYou are a seasoned organic chemist. Suggest a \nsynthesis pathway to get C[N+](C)(C)C1=CC=CC=C1 \nusing commercially available reagents. It should end \nwithin two steps. You may use Menshutkin reaction. \nThe compound you want to synthesize is a quaternary \nammonium salt with a benzyl group, commonly known as \nbenzyltrimethylammonium. Here is a two-step synthesis \npathway using commercially available reagents: \nStep 1: Start with benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl) and \ntrimethylamine (N(CH3)3). \nStep 2: Perform a Menshutkin reaction. This reaction involves \nthe nucleophilic substitution of the benzyl chloride by the \ntrimethylamine. The chlorine atom in the benzyl chloride is a \ngood leaving group, which makes the carbon atom it is \nattached to electrophilic. The nitrogen atom in the \ntrimethylamine is nucleophilic because it has a lone pair of \nelectrons. When these two compounds are combined, the \nnitrogen donates its lone pair to form a bond with the carbon, \nand the chlorine leaves, resulting in the formation of \nbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride (C6H5CH2N+(CH3)3 Cl-). \nNote: The Menshutkin reaction is typically performed in a \npolar aprotic solvent like acetonitrile or DMF, and may require \nheating to drive the reaction to completion. The resulting \nbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride can be used as is, or if the \nfree cation is needed, the chloride anion can be exchanged \nfor a different anion using an ion exchange resin. \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wqxl7 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-7978 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.
