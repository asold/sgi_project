A\nCRS is usually composed of a recommenda-\ntion module and a generation module.

More extensive analyses\nshow the effectiveness of our model.\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, there have been fast-growing re-\nsearch interests to address Conversational Rec-\n∗Work performed during internship at Microsoft STCA.\n†Corresponding author: djiang@microsoft.com.\n1The code is available at https://github.com/\nLingzhi-WANG/PLM-BasedCRS\nommender System (CRS) (Li et al., 2018; Sun\nand Zhang, 2018; Zhou et al., 2020a), due to the\nbooming of intelligent agents in e-commerce plat-\nforms. It aims to recommend target items to users\nthrough interactive conversations. Traditional rec-\nommender systems perform personalized recom-\nmendations based on user’s previous implicit feed-\nback like clicking or purchasing histories, while\nCRS can proactively ask clariﬁcation questions and\nextract user preferences from conversation history\nto conduct precise recommendations. Existing gen-\nerative methods (Chen et al., 2019; Zhou et al.,\n2020a; Ma et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2021) are\ngenerally composed of two modules, i.e., a rec-\nommender module to predict precise items and a\ndialogue module to generate free-form natural re-\nsponses containing the recommended items. Such\nmethods usually utilize Copy Mechanism (Gu et al.,\n2016) or Pointer Network (Gulcehre et al., 2016)\nto inject the recommended items into the generated\nreplies. However, these strategies cannot always\nincorporate the recommended items into the gener-\nated responses precisely and appropriately. On the\nother hand, most of the existing CRS datasets (Li\net al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020b; Liu et al., 2020,\n2021) are relatively small (∼10K dialogues) due\nto the expensive crowd-sourcing labor. The end-to-\nend neural models trained on these datasets from\nscratch are prone to be overﬁtting and have unde-\nsirable quality on the generated replies in practice.\nEncouraged by the compelling performance of\npre-training techniques, we present a pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) based framework called\nRecInDial to address these challenges. RecIn-\nDial integrates the item recommendation into the\ndialogue generation under the pretrain-ﬁnetune\nschema. Speciﬁcally, RecInDial ﬁnetunes the pow-\nerful PLMs like DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020)\ntogether with a Relational Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (RGCN) to encode the node representa-\ntion of an item-oriented knowledge graph. The\narXiv:2110.07477v2  [cs.CL]  7 Oct 2022\n...\nUser: That sounds good. I could go with a classic. Have\nyou seen Troll 2 (1990)? I’m looking for a horrible movie.\ncheesy horror\nHuman: Tuesday 13, you like?\nReDial: Black Panther (2018) is a good one too.\nKBRD: or It (2017)\nKGSF: I would recommend watching it.\nOUR: yes I have seen that one. It was good. I also liked\nthe movie It (2017).\n...\nTable 1: A conversation example with movies recom-\nmendation from the test set of ReDial dataset.\nformer aims to generate ﬂuent and diverse dialogue\nresponses based on the strong language generation\nability of PLMs, while the latter is to facilitate the\nitem recommendation by learning better structural\nnode representations. To bridge the gap between\nresponse generation and item recommendation, we\nexpand the generation vocabulary of PLMs to in-\nclude an extra item vocabulary. Then a vocabulary\npointer is introduced to control when to predict\na target item from the item vocabulary or a word\nfrom the ordinary vocabulary in the generation pro-\ncess. The introduced item vocabulary and vocab-\nulary pointer effectively unify the two individual\nprocesses of response generation and item recom-\nmendation into one single framework in a more\nconsistent fashion.\nTo better illustrate the motivation of our work,\nTable 1 shows a conversation example on looking\nfor horrible movies and the corresponding replies\ngenerated by four models (ReDial (Li et al., 2018),\nKBRD (Chen et al., 2019), KGSF (Zhou et al.,\n2020a), OUR) together with the ground truth reply\nin the corpus (Human). As we can see, the previ-\nous work tends to generate short (e.g., “KBRD: or\nIt (2017)”) or in-coherent responses (e.g., “KGSF:\nI would recommend watching it.”), which is re-\nsulted from the overﬁtting on the small dataset as\nwe mentioned before. Different from them, our\nmodel can generate more informative and coherent\nsentences which shows a better chatting ability. In\nadditon, we can notice that KGSF fails to raise a\nrecommendation in the response “I would recom-\nmend watching it” (“it” should be replaced with\na speciﬁc item name in a successful combination\nof generation and recommendation results), which\nis probably due to the insufﬁcient semantic knowl-\nedge learned and an ineffective copy mechanism.\nOur proposed uniﬁed PLM-based framework with\na vocabulary pointer can effectively solve the issue.\nFurthermore, to better investigate the end-to-end\nCRS system, we argue to evaluate the performance\nof recommendation by checking whether the ﬁ-\nnal responses contain the target items. Existing\nworks separately evaluate the performance of the\ntwo modules, i.e., dialogue generation and item\nrecommendation. However, a copy mechanism or\npointer network cannot always inject the recom-\nmended items into generated replies precisely and\nappropriately as we mentioned before. The per-\nformance of the ﬁnal recommendations is actually\nlower than that of the recommender module. For\ninstance, the Recall@1 of the recommender mod-\nule in KGSF (Zhou et al., 2020a) is 3.9% while the\nactual performance is only 0.9% when evaluating\nthe ﬁnal integrated responses (see Table 3).\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the pop-\nular benchmark REDIAL (Li et al., 2018). Our\nRecInDial model achieves a remarkable improve-\nment on the recommendation over the state-of-the-\nart, and the generated responses are also signiﬁ-\ncantly better on automatic metrics as well as hu-\nman evaluation. Further ablation studies and quan-\ntitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our approach.\nThe contributions of this work can be:\n• We propose a PLM-based framework called\nRecInDial for conversational recommendation.\nRecInDial ﬁnetunes the large-scale PLMs to-\ngether with a Relational Graph Convolutional\nNetwork to address the low-resource challenge\nin the current CRS.\n• By introducing an extra item vocabulary with a\nvocabulary pointer, RecInDial effectively uniﬁes\ntwo components of item recommendation and re-\nsponse generation into a PLM-based framework.\n• Extensive experiments show RecInDial signiﬁ-\ncantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\non the evaluation of both dialogue generation and\nrecommendation.\n2 Related Work\nExisting works in CRS can be mainly divided into\ntwo categories, namely attribute-based CRS and\nopen-ended CRS.\nAttribute-based CRS. The attribute-based CRS\ncan be viewed as a question-driven task-oriented di-\nalogue system (Zhang et al., 2018; Sun and Zhang,\n2018). This kind of system proactively asks clariﬁ-\ncation questions about the item attributes to infer\nuser preferences, and thus search for the optimal\ncandidates to recommend. There are various ask-\ning strategies studied by existing works, such as\nentropy-ranking based approach (Wu et al., 2018),\ngeneralized binary search based approaches (Zou\nand Kanoulas, 2019; Zou et al., 2020), reinforce-\nment learning based approaches (Chen et al., 2018;\nLei et al., 2020a; Deng et al., 2021), adversarial\nlearning based approach (Ren et al., 2020b) and\ngraph based approaches (Xu et al., 2020; Lei et al.,\n2020b; Ren et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021). Another\nline of research on this direction address the trade-\noff issue between exploration ( i.e., asking ques-\ntions) and exploitation (i.e., making recommenda-\ntions) to achieve both the engaging conversations\nand successful recommendations, especially for the\ncold-start users. Some of them leverage bandit on-\nline recommendation methods to address cold-start\nscenarios (Li et al., 2010, 2016b; Christakopoulou\net al., 2016; Li et al., 2020), while others focus\non the asking strategy with fewer turns (Lei et al.,\n2020a,b; Shi et al., 2019; Sun and Zhang, 2018).\nOpen-ended CRS. Existing works (Li et al.,\n2018; Lei et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; Ren et al.,\n2020a; Hayati et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Liu\net al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022) on this direction ex-\nplore CRS through more free-form conversations,\nincluding proactively asking clariﬁcation questions,\nchatting with users, providing the recommenda-\ntion, etc. Multiple datasets have been released to\nhelp push forward the research in this area, such\nas REDIAL (Li et al., 2018), TG-R EDIAL (Chi-\nnese) (Zhou et al., 2020b), INSPIRED (Hayati\net al., 2020) and DuRecDial (Liu et al., 2020, 2021).\nLi et al. (2018) make the ﬁrst attempt on this di-\nrection and contribute the benchmark dataset RE-\nDIAL by the paired crowd-workers ( i.e., Seeker\nand Recommender). Follow-up studies (Chen et al.,\n2019; Zhou et al., 2020a,b) leverage the multiple\nexternal knowledge to enhance the performance\nof open-ended CRS. CR-Walker (Ma et al., 2020)\nis proposed to perform the tree-structured reason-\ning on the knowledge graph to introduce relevant\nitems, while MGCG (Liu et al., 2020) addresses\nthe transition policy from a non-recommendation\ndialogue to a recommendation-oriented one. Be-\nsides, Zhou et al. (2021) develop an open-source\ntoolkit CRSLab to further facilitate the research on\nthis direction. Most of these works utilize pointer\nnetwork (Gulcehre et al., 2016) or copy mecha-\nnism (Gu et al., 2016; Sha et al., 2018) to inject\nthe recommended items into generated replies.

While\ndifferent from the previous work, we present a\nPLM-based framework for CRS, which ﬁnetunes\nthe large-scale PLMs together with a pre-trained\nRelational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN)\nto address the low-resource challenge in CRS.\nAnother line of related work lies in the end-to-\nend task-oriented dialogs (Wu et al., 2019; He et al.,\n2020; Raghu et al., 2021), which also require re-\nsponse generation based on a knowledge base but\nnot for recommendations.\n3 Methodology\nIn this section, we present our proposed RecInDial\nmodel. Figure 1 shows the model overview. We\nﬁrst formalize the conversational recommendation\ntask and then detail our PLM-based response gener-\nation module together with the vocabulary pointer.\nAfter that, we introduce how to incorporate the\nknowledge from an item-oriented knowledge graph\nwith an RGCN into the model. Finally, we describe\nthe model training objectives.\n3.1 Problem Formalization\nThe input of a CRS model contains the history\ncontext of a conversation, which is denoted as a\nsequence of utterances {t1,t2,...,t m}in chrono-\nlogical order ( m represents the number of utter-\nances). Each utterance is either given by the\nseeker (user) or recommender (the model), which\ncontains the token sequence {wi,1,wi,2,...,w i,ni}\n(1 ≤i ≤m), where wij is the j-th token in the\ni-th utterance and ni is the number of tokens in\ni-th utterance. Note that we deﬁne the name of an\nitem as a single token and do not tokenize it. The\noutput token sequence by the model is denoted as\n{wn+1,wn+2,...,w n+k}, where kis the number of\ngenerated tokens and n= ∑m\n1 ni is the total num-\nber of tokens in context. When the model conducts\nthe recommendation, it will generate an item token\nwn+i (1 ≤i≤k) together with the corresponding\ncontext. In this way, recommendation item and\nresponse are generated concurrently.\n3.2 Response Generation Model\nIn this subsection, we introduce how to extend\nPLMs to handle CRS task and produce items rec-\nommendation during the dialogue generation.\nPLM-based Response Generation. Given the\ninput ( i.e., the conversation history context\n{t1,t2,...,t m}), we concatenate the history utter-\nances into the contextC = {w1,w2,...,w n}where\nn is the total number of tokens in the context.\nThen the probability of the generated response\nR= {wn+1,wn+2,...,w n+k}is formulated as:\nPLM(R|C) =\nn+k∏\ni=n+1\np(wi|w1,...,w i−1). (1)\nwhere PLM(·|·) denotes the PLMs of Trans-\nformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture. For\na multi-turn conversation, we can constructN such\ncontext-response pairs, where N is the number of\nutterances by the recommender. Then we ﬁnetune\nthe PLMs on all possible (C,R) pairs constructed\nfrom the dialogue corpus. By this means, not only\ndoes our model inherit the strong language genera-\ntion ability of the PLMs, but also simultaneously\ncan learn how to generate the recommendation ut-\nterances on the relatively small CRS dataset.\nPLM-based Item Generation. To integrate the\nitem recommendation into the generation process\nof PLMs, we propose to expand the generation\nvocabulary of PLMs by including an extra item vo-\ncabulary. We devise a vocabulary pointer to control\nwhen to generate tokens from the ordinary vocabu-\nlary or from the item vocabulary. Concretely, we\nregard an item as a single token and add all items\ninto the item vocabulary. Hence, our model can\nlearn the relationship between context words and\ncandidate items. Such a process integrates the re-\nsponse generation and item recommendation into\na uniﬁed model that can perform the end-to-end\nrecommendation through dialogue generation.\nVocabulary Pointer. We ﬁrst preprocess the di-\nalogue corpus and introduce two special tokens\n[RecS] and [RecE] to indicate the start and end\npositions of the item in utterance. Then we divide\nAlgorithm 1 V ocabulary Pointer based Generation\nfor RecInDial\nInput: history context C, general and item vocabulary VG,\nVR\nOutput: generated response R\nextract appeared entities from Cas user preference Tu\ncompute knowledge-aware bias bu based on Tu using Eq. 5\nto 8\nR←{}\nn←0\nIvp ←0, V ←VG\nwhile n<N max do\nwn = Decode(C⋃R,V, bu) ⊿Generate wn based\non the previous tokens and bias from V\nR←R⋃{wn}\nif wn = [RecS] then ⊿Generate tokens from VR\nIvp ←1, V ←VR\nelse if wn = [RecE] then ⊿Generate tokens from VG\nIvp ←0, V ←VG\nelse if wn = [EOS] then ⊿Generation is done\nbreak\nend if\nn←n+ 1\nend while\nreturn R\nthe whole vocabulary V into VG and VR, where\nVG includes the general tokens (i.e., tokens in the\noriginal vocabulary of PLM) and [RecS] while\nVR contains the all item tokens and [RecE]. We\nthen introduce a binary Vocabulary PointerIvp to\nguide the generation from VG or VR. The model\ngenerates tokens in VG when Ivp = 0, and gener-\nates the tokens in VR when Ivp = 1, which can be\nformulated as follows:\np(w= wi) = exp(φI(wi) +˜hi)∑\nwj∈V exp(φI(wj) +˜hj)\n(2)\nφI(wj) =\n\n\n\n0, I vp = 0,wj ∈VG or\nIvp = 1,wj ∈VR,\n−inf, I vp = 1,wj ∈VG or\nIvp = 0,wj ∈VR\n, (3)\nwhere ˜h= hLWT\ne is the feature vector before the\nsoftmax layer in Figure 1, ˜hi means the feature\nvalue of the i-th token. Ivp is initialized as 0 at\nthe beginning of the generation and won’t change\nuntil the model produces [RecS] or [RecE]. It\nchanges to 1 if the model produces [RecS] (i.e.,\nthe model begins to generate items) and changes\nback to 0 if [RecE] is emitted. Such a proce-\ndure continues until the turn is ﬁnished. With the\nVocabulary Pointer, our model can alternatively\nswitch between generating response words and rec-\nommending items based on its previous outputs in\na uniﬁed fashion.\nTo help readers better understand the V ocabulary\nPointer mechanism, we summarize the process in\nAlgorithm 1.\n3.3 Knowledge Graph Enhanced Finetuning\nDue to the difﬁculty of fully understanding user\npreferences by the conversation context, it is neces-\nsary to introduce the external knowledge to encode\nthe user preferences when ﬁnetuning response gen-\neration model. Inspired by the previous work (Chen\net al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020a), we also employ a\nknowledge graph from DBpedia (Lehmann et al.,\n2015) and perform entity linking (Daiber et al.,\n2013) to the items in the dataset, which helps better\nmodel the user preferences. A triple in DBpedia\nis denoted by < e1,r,e2 >, where e1,e2 ∈E are\nitems or entities from the entity setEand ris entity\nrelation from the relation set R.\nRelational Graph Propagation. We utilize R-\nGCN (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) to encode struc-\ntural and relational information in the knowledge\ngraph to entity hidden representations. Formally,\nthe representation of node eat (l+ 1)-th layer is:\nh(l+1)\ne = σ(\n∑\nr∈R\n∑\ne′∈Ere\n1\nZe,r\nW(l)\nr h(l)\ne′ + W(l)h(l)\ne ), (4)\nwhere h(l)\ne ∈RdE is the node representation of e\nat the l-th layer, and Er\ne denotes the set of neigh-\nboring nodes for eunder the relation r. W(l)\nr is\na learnable relation-speciﬁc transformation matrix\nfor the embedding from neighboring nodes with\nrelation r, while W(l) is another learnable matrix\nfor transforming the representations of nodes at the\nl-th layer and Ze,r is a normalization factor.\nAt the last layer L, structural and relational in-\nformation is encoded into the entity representation\nh(L)\ne for each e ∈E . The resulting knowledge-\nenhanced hidden representation matrix for entities\nin Eis denoted as H(L) ∈R|E|×dE . We omit the\n(L) in the following paragraphs for simplicity.\nEntity Attention. Given a conversation context,\nwe ﬁrst collect the entities appeared in the context,\nand then we represent the user preference as Tu =\ne1,e2,...,e |Tu|, where ei ∈E . After looking up\nthe knowledge-enhanced representation table of\nentities in Tu from H, we get:\nHu = (h1,h2,..., h|Tu|), (5)\nwhere hi ∈RdE is the hidden vector of entity ei.\nThen the self-attention mechanism (Lin et al., 2017)\nis applied to Hu, which outputs a distribution αu\nover |Tu|vectors:\nαu = softmax(wa2tanh(Wa1HT\nu )), (6)\nwhere Wa1 ∈Rda×dE and wa2 ∈R1×da are learn-\nable parameters. Then we get the ﬁnal representa-\ntion for user history uas follows:\ntu = αuHu. (7)\nKnowledge-Aware Bias. To incorporate the\nknowledge from the constructed knowledge graph\ninto our model while generating recommendation\nitems, we ﬁrst map the derived user representation\ntu into the item vocabulary space |VR|as follows:\nbu = tuHT Mb, (8)\nwhere Mb ∈R|E|×|VR|are learnable parameters.\nThen we add bu to the projection outputs before\nsoftmax operation in the generation as a bias. In\nthis way, our model can produce items in aware\nof their relational knowledge and thus enhance the\nperformance of recommendation.\n3.4 Recommendation in Beam Search\nTo embed the top-k item recommendation into the\ngeneration, we develop a revised beam search de-\ncoding. Speciﬁcally, when we ﬁnish the generation\nfor one response, we ﬁrst check whether it contains\nthe item names (i.e., whether it generates recom-\nmendations). If yes, then we choose the top-k items\nbetween [RecS] and [RecE] according to the\nprobability scores at current time-step.\n3.5 Learning Objectives\nThere are two objectives, i.e., node representation\nlearning on knowledge graph and the ﬁnetuning\nof response generation model. For the former, we\noptimize the R-GCN and the self-attention network\nbased on the cross entropy of item prediction:\nLkg =\n∑\n(u,i)∈D1\n−log( exp(tuHT )i∑\nj exp(tuHT )j\n), (9)\nwhere the item iis the ground-truth item and uis\nthe corresponding user history, while D1 contains\nall training instances and tuHT ∈R|E|.\nFor the latter, we optimize another cross entropy\nloss for all generated responses, denoted as R. The\nfollowing formula summarizes the process:\nLgen =\n∑\n(C,R)∈D2\n∑\nwi∈R\n−log(p(wi|w<i,C)), (10)\nwhere p(wi) refers to Eq. 2 and D2 contains all\n(C,R) pairs constructed from the dataset. We train\nthe whole model end-to-end with the joint effects\nof the two objectives Lkg + Lgen.\nConversations\n# of convs 10006\n# of utterances 182150\n# of users 956\navg token length 6.8\navg turn # 18.2\nMovies\n# of mentions 51699\n# of movies 6924\navg mentions 7.5\nmax mentions 1024\nmin mentions 1\nTable 2: Statistics of ReDial dataset. “#\" means number\nand “avg\" refers to average.\n4 Experimental Setup\nDatasets. We evaluate our model on the bench-\nmark dataset REDIAL (Li et al., 2018). Due to the\ncollection difﬁculty of the real world data, most\nthe previous work (Li et al., 2018; Chen et al.,\n2019; Zhou et al., 2020a) only conducts experi-\nments on this single dataset. The statistics of RE-\nDIAL dataset is shown in Table 2. Detailed statis-\ntics of movie mentions are shown in Figure 2(a).\nMost of the movies occur less than 5 times in the\ndataset, which indicates an obvious data imbalance\nproblem in the REDIAL . We also show the re-\nlationship between the average number of movie\nmentions and the number of dialog turns in Fig-\nure 2(b). As we can see, there are less than 2 movie\nmentions when the dialogue turn number is less\nthan 5. Finally, we follow (Li et al., 2018) to split\nthe dataset into 80-10-10, for training, validation\nand test.\nParameter Setting. We ﬁnetune the small size\npre-trained DialoGPT model2, which consists of 12\ntransformer layers. The dimension of embeddings\nis 768. It is trained on 147M multi-turn dialogues\nfrom Reddit discussion threads. For the knowledge\ngraph (KG), both the entity embedding size and the\nhidden representation size are set to 128, and we\nset the layer number for R-GCN to 1. For BART\nbaseline, we ﬁnetune the base model3 with 6 layers\nin each of the encoder and decoder, and a hidden\nsize of 1024. For GPT-2 baseline, we ﬁnetune the\nsmall model4. For all model’s training, we adopt\nAdam optimizer and the learning rate is chosen\nfrom {1e−5, 1e−4}. The batch size is chosen from\n{32, 64}, the gradient accumulation step is set to\n8, and the warm-up step is chosen from {500, 800,\n1000}. All the hyper-parameters are determined by\ngrid-search.\n2https://huggingface.co/microsoft/\nDialoGPT-small\n3https://huggingface.co/facebook/\nbart-base\n4https://huggingface.co/gpt2\n4567\n90013101023672090018002700360045005400\n[1,5)[5,10)[10,100)[100, 200)[200,400)[400,800)>= 800\nFrequency\n(a) Movie # Distribution\n0246810\n1591317212529\nAVG Movie Mentions (b) Position Distribution\nFigure 2: For Figure 2(a), X-axis: the movie mentions\nrange; Y-axis: movie numbers. For Figure 2(b), X-axis:\nturn positions; Y-axis: average movie mentions.\nBaselines and Comparisons. We ﬁrst introduce\ntwo baselines for recommender and dialogue mod-\nules, respectively. (1) Popularity. It ranks the\nmovie items according to their historical frequency\nin the training set without a dialogue module. (2)\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). It utilizes\na transformer-based encoder-decoder to generate\nresponses without recommender module.\nWe then compare the following baseline models\nin the experiment: (3) ReDial (Li et al., 2018). It\nconsists of a dialogue generation module based on\nHRED (Serban et al., 2017), a recommender mod-\nule based on auto-encoder (He et al., 2017), and a\nsentiment analysis module. (4) KBRD (Chen et al.,\n2019). It utilizes a knowledge graph from DBpedia\nto model the relational knowledge of contextual\nitems or entities, and the dialogue generation mod-\nule is based on the transformer architecture. (5)\nKGSF (Zhou et al., 2020a). It incorporates and\nfuses both word-level and entity-level knowledge\ngraphs to learn better semantic representations for\nuser preferences. (6) GPT-2. We directly ﬁnetune\nGPT-2 and expand its vocabulary to include the\nitem vocabulary. (7) BART. We directly ﬁnetune\nBART and expand its vocabulary to include the\nsame item vocabulary. (8) DialoGPT. We directly\nﬁnetune DialoGPT and expand its vocabulary to\ninclude same item vocabulary.\nFor our RecInDial, in addition to the full model\n(9) RecInDial, we also evaluate two variants: (10)\nRecInDial w/o VP, where we remove the vocabu-\nlary pointer; and (11) RecInDial w/o KG, where\nthe knowledge graph part is removed.\nEvaluation Metrics. As we discussed above, the\nprevious works evaluate the recommender and dia-\nlogue modules separately. Following the previous\nsetting (Chen et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020a), we\nevaluate the recommender module by Recall@k (k\n= 1, 10, 50). Besides, we also evaluate Recall@k\nin an end-to-end manner, i.e., to check whether the\nﬁnal produced response contains the target item.\nIn such a setting, the Recall@K score not only de-\npends on whether the ground truth item appears in\nthe top K recommendation list but also reply on if\nthe recommended item is successfully injected into\nthe generated sentences. Therefore, the end-to-end\nevaluation is fair for all models and applicable for\nK = 1, 10, 50. For the dialogue module, automatic\nmetrics include: (1) Fluency: perplexity (PPL)\nmeasures the conﬁdence of the generated responses.\n(2) Relevance: BLEU-2/4 (Papineni et al., 2002)\nand Rouge-L (Lin, 2004). (3) Diversity: Distinct-n\n(Dist-n) (Li et al., 2016a) are deﬁned as the number\nof distinct n-grams divided by the total amount of\nwords. Speciﬁcally, we use Dist-2/3/4 at the sen-\ntence level to evaluate the diversity of generated\nresponses. Besides, we also employ Item Ratio in-\ntroduced in KGSF (Zhou et al., 2020a) to measure\nthe ratio of items in the generated responses.\n5 Experimental Results\nIn this section, we ﬁrst report the comparison re-\nsults on recommendation and response generation.\nThen we discuss the human evaluation results. Af-\nter that, we show an example to illustrate how our\nmodel works, followed by qualitative analysis.\n5.1 Results on Recommendation\nThe main experimental results for our RECINDIAL\nand baseline models on recommendation side are\npresented in Table 3. And we can draw several\nobservations from the results.\nThere is a signiﬁcant gap between the perfor-\nmance of the recommender module and the perfor-\nmance of the ﬁnal integrated system. KGSF, the\nstate-of-the-art model, achieves 3.9% Recall@1\nin the recommender module evaluation but yields\nonly 0.9% in the evaluation of the ﬁnal produced\nresponses. This indicates that the integration strate-\ngies utilized by previous methods have signiﬁcant\nharm on the recommendation performance.\nFinetuning PLMs on the small CRS dataset\nis effective. As we can see, compared to non-\nPLM based methods, directly ﬁnetuning GPT-\n2/BART/DialoGPT on the REDIAL achieves the\nobvious performance gain on recommendation.\nOur RecInDial model signiﬁcantly outperforms\nthe SOTAs on recommendation performance. As\nshown in Table 2, our RecInDial achieves the best\nRecall@k (k = 1, 10, 50) scores under the end-to-\nend evaluation, which demonstrates the superior\nModels Eval on Rec Module End-to-End Eval\nR@1 R@10 R@50 R@1 R@10 R@50\nBaselines\nPopularity 1.2 6.1 17.9 1.2 6.1 17.9\nReDial 2.4 14.0 32.0 0.7 4.4 10.0\nKBRD 3.1 15.0 33.6 0.8 3.8 8.8\nKGSF 3.9 18.3 37.8 0.9 4.2 8.8\nGPT-2 - - - 1.4 6.5 14.4\nBART - - - 1.5 - -\nDialoGPT - - - 1.7 7.1 13.8\nRecInDial - - - 3.1 14.0 27.0\nTable 3: Main comparison results on recommendation.\nR@k refers to Recall@k.

Table 5 shows the\nmain comparison results on Dist-2/3/4, BLEU-2/4,\nRouge-L and PPL. As we can see, RecInDial signif-\nicantly outperforms all baselines on Dist-n, which\nindicates that PLM helps generate more diverse\nresponses. Previous works suffer from the low-\nresource issue due to the small crowd-sourcing\nCRS dataset and tend to generate boring and sin-\ngular responses. On the other hand, our RecInDial\nmodel tends to recommend items more frequently,\nas the Item Ratio score of RecInDial is much higher\nthan those of baselines. Besides, our RecInDial and\nPLM-based methods consistently achieve remark-\nable improvement over non-PLM based methods\non all metrics, which demonstrates the superior\nperformance of PLMs on dialogue generation.\nHuman Evaluation. To further investigate the\neffectiveness of RecInDial, we conduct a human\nevaluation experiment, where four crowd-workers\nare employed to score on 100 context-response\npairs that are randomly sampled from the test set.\nThen, we collect the generation results of RecIn-\nDial and the baseline models and compare their\nperformance on the following three aspects: (1)\nFluency. Whether a response is organized in reg-\nular English grammar and easy to understand. (2)\nInformativeness. Whether a response is mean-\ningful and not a “safe response”, and repetitive\nModels Dist-2 Dist-3 Dist-4 IR BL-2 BL-4 Rouge-L PPL↓\nBaselines\nTransformer 14.8 15.1 13.7 19.4 - - - -\nReDial 22.5 23.6 22.8 15.8 17.8 7.4 16.9 61.7\nKBRD 26.3 36.8 42.3 29.6 18.5 7.4 17.1 58.8\nKGSF 28.9 43.4 51.9 32.5 16.4 7.4 14.3 131.1\nGPT-2 35.4 48.6 44.1 14.5 17.1 7.7 11.3 56.3\nBART 37.6 49.0 43.5 16.0 17.8 9.3 13.1 55.6\nDialoGPT 47.6 55.9 48.6 15.9 16.7 7.8 12.3 56.0\nRecInDial51.8 62.4 59.8 43.5 20.4 11.0 17.6 54.1\nTable 5: Automatic metrics on generated responses.

(3) Co-\nherence. Whether a response is coherent with the\nprevious context. The crowd-workers give a score\non the scale of [0, 1, 2] to show the quality of the\nresponses, and higher scores indicate better quali-\nties.\nWe calculate the average score for each model,\nas well as the ground truth that humans give. As\nshown in Table 6, our model shows better perfor-\nmance than all the baselines. Interestingly, ground-\ntruth Human cannot get a 100% correctness in all\nthe four evaluation metrics. The reason may be that\nwords and phrases sent by human annotators on\nAMT platform sometimes are the casual usage pop-\nular on Internet, which has the wrong grammar. For\nthe ﬂuency, all models generate ﬂuent utterances\nand show similar performance. For the informative-\nness, our RecInDial achieves better performance\nthan the baselines, which indicates RecInDial tends\nto generate more meaningful responses.\n5.3 Ablation Study\nWe then report the performance comparisons on\nRecInDial’s variants. Table 4 shows the end-to-end\nrecommendation performance and generation re-\nsults. Removing the vocabulary pointer leads to\nsigniﬁcant drops on R@k and Item Ratio. This\nindicates Vocabulary Pointer (VP) introduced in\nRecInDial is crucial to the performance of item\nrecommendation. The reason is that the generation\nprocess would lose the guidance to switch between\ngeneral tokens and recommended items without\nthe help of the vocabulary pointer. Besides, we\ncan ﬁnd that knowledge graph enhanced ﬁnetuning\nhelps achieve better recommendation performance.\nIntroducing the node representations learned on the\nknowledge graph can model the user preference\nbetter, which could further enhance the recommen-\ndation performance.\n5.4 Qualitative Analysis\nIn this subsection, we present a conversation exam-\nple to illustrate how our model works in practice.\nConversation Example\nUser: I like to watch scary movies\nHuman: Tell me what kind of movie do you like? Did\nyou watch It (2017)? And It (1990)?\nKBRD: Hi, what kind of movies do you like?\nKGSF: Hello!\nRecInDial: Have you seen It (2017)?\nUser: I have seen the old one\nHuman: Did you watch The Exorcist (1973)?\nKBRD: Get Out (2017)\nKGSF: I would recommend Get Out (2017)\nRecInDial: How about Psycho (1960)?\nUser: I have not seen the new one I do like the\nexorcist\nHuman: Ok, you should watch the new one even\nthough I would rather the old one. And did\nyou watch The Last Exorcism (2010)? I hope\nI have helped\nKBRD: I haven’t seen that one\nKGSF: I would recommend it\nRecInDial: Yes, it was good. I hope you enjoy it. Have\na good day. Bye\nTable 7: A conversation example on movie item rec-\nommendation. The responses of KBRD, KGSF and\nRecInDial are from the test results for corresponding\nmodels. Human responses are ground-truth.\nIn Table 7, the Seeker states that he likes scary\nmovies. Our model successfully captured the key-\nword of “scary” and recommends a famous scary\nmovie “It (2017)” while the state-of-the-art model\nKGSF produces a safe response “Hello!”, which\nshows our RecInDial can generate the responses\nthat are more coherent with the context. Interest-\ningly, after the Seeker says he watched the old “It\n(1990)”, our model recommends another horror\nmovie “Psycho (1960)” also released in the last\ncentury. The possible reason is that RecInDial in-\nfers the seeker is interested in old horror movies.\nThe example in Table 7 shows that our RecInDial\ntends to generate a more informative response than\nKGSF. In addition, we ﬁnd that KGSF always gen-\nerates “I would recommend Item” (Item is replaced\nwith Get out (2017) in this example) and “I would\nrecommend it.”. The ﬁrst response pattern success-\nfully integrates the movie item into the response,\n00.10.20.30.40.50.6\n[1,5)[5,10)[10,100)[100, 200)[200,400)[400,800)>= 800\nRecall@30Recall@50\n(a) Recall over Mentions\n00.050.10.150.20.250.3\n123456789101112\nRecall@30Recall@50 (b) Recall over Turn #\nFigure 3: Y-axis: Recall. For Fig. 3(a), X-axis: Movie\nmentions range. For Fig. 3(b), X-axis: turn numbers.\nwhile the second fails to make a complete recom-\nmendation, which reveals the drawback of the copy\nmechanism in KGSF.\n5.5 Further Analysis\nAnalysis on Data Imbalance. As we discussed\naforementioned, the movie occurrence frequency\nshows an imbalanced distribution over different\nmovies (see Figure 2(a)). To investigate the effect,\nwe report the Recall@30 and Recall@50 scores\nover movie mentioned times in Figure 3(a). As we\ncan see, the recall scores for low-frequency movies\n(with mentioned times less than 10) are much lower\nthan those high-frequency movies (with > 100\nmentions). However, most of the movies (5467 out\nof 6924 movies) in the REDIAL dataset are low-\nfrequency movies, which leads to relatively low\nresults in the overall performance.\nAnalysis on Cold Start. REDIAL dataset suffers\nfrom the cold-start problem. It is hard for models\nto recommend precise items in the ﬁrst few turns\nof the conversation. We report the Recall@30 and\nRecall@50 scores of our RecInDial over different\ndialogue turns in Figure 3(b). Generally, we can see\nthat the recall scores are getting better with richer\ninformation gradually obtained from dialogue in-\nteractions. The scores begin to drop when there\nare more than 5 turns. The possible reason is that\nas the conversation goes deeper, the Seekers are\nno longer satisﬁed with the recommended high-\nfrequency movies but prefer more personalized rec-\nommendations, which makes it more difﬁcult to\npredict in practice.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper presents a novel uniﬁed PLM-based\nframework called RecInDial for CRS, which inte-\ngrates the item recommendation into the genera-\ntion process. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnetune the large-\nscale PLMs together with a relational graph con-\nvolutional network on an item-oriented knowledge\ngraph. Besides, we design a vocabulary pointer\nmechanism to unify the response generation and\nitem recommendation into the existing PLMs. Ex-\ntensive experiments on the CRS benchmark dataset\nREDIAL show that RecInDial signiﬁcantly outper-\nforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers\nfor their feedback and suggestions.
