    "abstract": "A new highly compact topology for solid‐state transformers is presented. It is based on modular multilevel converters and, therefore, has their usual advantages such as superior voltage shape, high reliability, and scalability. It utilises arm inductors for the isolated energy transfer between two converters and thereby allows for a more compact build compared to the design that uses separate transformers.",
