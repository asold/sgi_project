Conse-\nquently, when faced with an unknown object, it becomes\nchallenging to accurately estimate its 6D pose, which sig-\nniﬁcantly affects pose estimation in real-world scenes.\n\u0003Corresponding author.\nCopyright c\r 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

The ﬁne deformation part is\nused to ﬁne deform the prior point cloud. The recurrent re-\nﬁnement is used to recurrent reﬁne the point cloud from the\nﬁne deformation part.\nTo solve this problem, researchers propose several model-\nindependent methods for category-level object 6D pose esti-\nmation (Wang et al. 2019b; Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020; Chen\net al. 2021, 2020a; Di et al. 2022; Lin et al. 2022a). Esti-\nmating the pose at the category level is more challenging\nthan instance-level methods due to the lack of 3D models\nfor objects. Some approaches, like (Wang et al. 2019b; Chen\nand Dou 2021), address this issue by introducing a “Normal-\nized Object Coordinate Space” (NOCS) where they predict\nthe 3D model of the object. Additionally, most methods rely\non point clouds to capture the object’s geometric structure.\nRecognizing the similarity in geometry among objects in the\nsame category, certain methods, such as (Tian, Ang, and Lee\n2020; Chen and Dou 2021; Lin et al. 2022a), utilize an aver-\nage point cloud as prior knowledge, enabling rough estima-\ntion of the geometric information in the scene.\nHowever, investigating how to handle intra-class object\nvariety and accurately model objects based on prior point\nclouds is an important problem. Firstly, in real scenes, the\ncamera’s view can be disrupted, resulting in fragmented\npoint cloud information. The key challenge is how to com-\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6808\nplete the point cloud with limited data. Additionally, de-\nforming the prior point cloud appropriately to accurately ﬁt\nthe object in the scene is another crucial consideration. Fur-\nthermore, a single deformation may not sufﬁce to accurately\nrepresent the object structure, necessitating multiple defor-\nmations. However, certain methods, like (Tian, Ang, and Lee\n2020; Chen and Dou 2021; Chen et al. 2020a), have over-\nlooked these issues. They directly input RGB images with\npoint cloud information and combine features for pose es-\ntimation, leading to inaccurate predictions. Although some\nmethods try to use feature fusion for improved pose estima-\ntion, a gap remains compared to the actual poses.\nWe introduce CatFormer, a transformer-based method\nfor category-level 6D object pose estimation, aiming to\naddress these challenges. Currently, there is a scarcity of\ntransformer-based methods for category-level pose estima-\ntion, such as (Zou et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2023). Our proposed\nmethod leverages transformers and achieves SOTA perfor-\nmance on benchmark datasets.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, CatFormer comprises three main\ncomponents: the coarse deformation part, the ﬁne deforma-\ntion part, and the recurrent reﬁnement part. In the coarse and\nﬁne deformation parts, we introduce a transformer-based\ndeformation module to deform and complement the point\ncloud, enabling a better ﬁt with the target object in the scene.\nAdditionally, we propose a transformer-based graph module\nto reﬁne and adjust fused features, learning geometric rela-\ntionships and topological information within the point cloud\nfor improved understanding of the object’s 3D structure.\nFurthermore, we propose an end-to-end multi-stage reﬁne-\nment method that utilizes RGB image and scene point cloud\nfusion features to guide multiple deformations of the ﬁne de-\nformed prior point cloud, resulting in a signiﬁcantly better\nﬁt with the target object in the scene. Our proposed method\ndemonstrates notable improvements over SOTA methods on\nthe dataset, surpassing some existing SOTA methods by\nmore than 10% in certain evaluation metrics. We have also\nsuccessfully applied CatFormer to instance-level pose esti-\nmation and real object pose estimation.\nIn summary, the main contributions of this paper are sum-\nmarized as follows:\n\u000fWe propose a novel transformer-based deformation mod-\nule to perform coarse deformation on the scene point\ncloud and ﬁne deformation on the prior point cloud.\n\u000fA transformer-based graph module is proposed to help\nnetworks adjust fused features and construct geomet-\nric and topological relationships between points in point\ncloud features.\n\u000fWe propose an end-to-end recurrent reﬁnement module\nthat guides the prior point cloud to perform multiple it-\nerations of reﬁnement based on the guide of the fusion\nfeatures of RGB images and point cloud, so that the prior\npoint cloud can largely ﬁt the target object.\n2 Related Works\n2.1 Instance-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation\nRecently, there has been extensive research on deep\nlearning-based methods for instance-level 6D object pose\nestimation. These methods can be categorized into two\ngroups: direct regression and keypoints correspondence. Di-\nrect regression methods, such as (Xiang et al. 2018; Kehl\net al. 2017; Labb ´e et al. 2020; Li et al. 2018; Manhardt\net al. 2019, 2018; Wang et al. 2019a), take RGB or RGB-\nD images as input and directly predict the 6D pose based\non extracted features. While these methods are generally\ntime-efﬁcient, they may lack accuracy in certain cases.\nTo address this, researchers propose keypoints correspon-\ndence methods, including (Li, Wang, and Ji 2019; Zakharov,\nShugurov, and Ilic 2019; Park, Patten, and Vincze 2019;\nPeng et al. 2019). These methods predict predeﬁned object\ncoordinates or 2D keypoints and calculate the 6D pose using\nthe Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm (Lepetit, Moreno-\nNoguer, and Fua 2009) based on the correspondence be-\ntween 2D and 3D points. Some approaches also utilize key-\npoint voting for 6D pose prediction, such as (He et al. 2020,\n2021). However, the non-differentiable nature of PnP makes\nit challenging to apply this two-stage pipeline in tasks that\nrequire differentiable poses. Consequently, alternative tech-\nniques have been explored to learn the PnP step, such as (Di\net al. 2021; Hu et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021).\n2.2 Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation\nTo address the limitations of instance-level methods, re-\nsearchers have explored novel approaches that reduce re-\nliance on 3D models. Category-level 6D object pose estima-\ntion methods have emerged in recent years, including (Wang\net al. 2019b; Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020; Chen et al. 2021;\nChen and Dou 2021; Lin et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2020a; Di\net al. 2022; Lin et al. 2022a; You et al. 2022). In (Wang\net al. 2019b), Wang et al. propose NOCS, a method that\nprojects all objects into the same coordinate space and em-\nploys Umeyama’s algorithm (Umeyama 1991) to calculate\nthe 6D object pose. However, since objects within the same\ncategory can have distinct shapes, it is challenging to capture\nthe shape variations between each object. To overcome this\nchallenge, some methods introduce shape priors to mitigate\nthe inﬂuence of shape variations (Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020;\nChen and Dou 2021; Wang, Chen, and Dou 2021; Zou et al.\n2022). For example, in (Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020), Tian et al.\nincorporate a prior point cloud during training and connect\nthe features from the scene point cloud and RGB images.\nThey then predict the NOCS coordinates of the target ob-\nject and calculate its pose. In (Chen and Dou 2021), Chen et\nal. propose SGPA, which introduces a feature fusion module\nbased on vision transformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) to merge\nthe features from RGB images and point clouds. Some meth-\nods aim to directly predict the rotation, translation, and size\nof the object based on extracted features, as demonstrated in\n(Lin et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2021; Di et al. 2022).\nMany methods try to deform the shape prior to ﬁt the\ntarget object, such as (Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020; Lin et al.\n2022a; Chen and Dou 2021; Wang, Chen, and Dou 2021;\nZhang et al. 2022). Some of these methods leverage fused\nfeatures to deform the shape prior, such as (Tian, Ang, and\nLee 2020; Chen and Dou 2021; Wang, Chen, and Dou 2021).\nOthers attempt to share the weights of the network during\nthe feature extraction process for both the point cloud and\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6809\nC\nMask-RCNN\nPointNet++\nCNN\nSA\nSA\nSA\nSA\nCA\nSA\nSA\nSA\nSA\nCA\noffset\nC\nMLP\nSA\nCA\nC\nSelf-Attention\nCross-Attention\nAdd\nConcatenation\nMultiply\nRGB image\nDepth image\n𝑃𝑟\n𝐼\n𝑃𝑜\n𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙\n𝑖𝑛𝑠 𝐹𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙\n𝑖𝑛𝑠\n𝐹𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙\n𝑖𝑛𝑠\n𝑃𝑟\n(𝑖+1)\nRepeat\nGM\nGM\n𝐹𝑟𝑔𝑏\n𝐹𝑜\nCoarse Deform AVE\nGM\nGM\n𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙\n𝑐𝑎𝑡\nAVE\n𝐹𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙\n𝑐𝑎𝑡 𝑃𝑟\n𝐹𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙\n𝑖𝑛𝑠\n𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙\n𝑐𝑎𝑡\nPointNet++\nC C\nTransform \nMatrix\n𝐹𝑇\n(𝑖)\nFine Deform\nFinal Model\n6D Pose\nNOCS\nGM Graph Module\n Coarse Deformation\n Fine Deformation  Recurrent Refinement\nAVE Average Pooling\nFigure 2: An overview of CatFormer for category-level 6D object pose estimation. We initially employ Mask-RCNN to predict\nthe mask and category of the target object. CatFormer takes the object point cloudPo, RGB image I, and prior point cloudPr as\ninputs. Firstly, we utilize the coarse deformation module with the graph module to deform and complement Po. Subsequently,\nemploying the ﬁne deformation module with the graph module and Pr generates relatively accurate point cloud features for\nthe object. Ultimately, a recurrent reﬁnement module is used to enhance the point cloud features, resulting in the ﬁnal NOCS\nmodel of the object. Based on the predicted NOCS model, we generate the 6D pose of the object.\nthe shape prior, such as (Lin et al. 2022a; Zhang et al. 2022).\nHowever, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that\ndiffers from these methods. Instead of adopting the afore-\nmentioned ideas, our method utilizes a constructed feature\ngraph and repetitive reﬁnement to deform the shape prior.\n3 Method\n3.1 Pipeline Overview\nThe pipeline of CatFormer is provided in Figure 1. Initially,\nthe input consists of the RGB image Io 2RH\u0002W\u00023 and\nthe point cloud Po 2RNo\u00023 of the target object. PSPNet\n(Zhao et al. 2017) is employed to extract features from the\nRGB image, resulting in Frgb 2 RNo\u0002d. Simultaneously,\nPointNet++ (Qi et al. 2017) is used to extract features from\nthe point cloud, yielding Fo 2RNo\u0002d. Next, the deforma-\ntion module is utilized to complement and deform the point\ncloud. Additionally, PointNet++ is applied to extract fea-\ntures from the prior point cloud Pr 2RNr\u00023, generating\nFr 2RNr\u0002d. The fused feature from Frgb and Fo is then\nemployed to deform Pr within the ﬁne deformation module.\nTo capture geometrical information about the object and ad-\njust the fused feature, a graph module establishes the graph\nfeature after each point cloud deformation process. Finally,\nthe recurrent reﬁnement module is leveraged to further re-\nﬁne the prior point cloud.\n3.2 Deformation Module\nWe propose a transformer-based deformation module con-\nsisting of self-attention (SA) and cross-attention (CA) mod-\nules to deform and complete the shape of the point cloud.\nThe coarse deformation process applies coarse deformation\nto the scene point cloud, while the ﬁne deformation process\ndeforms the prior point cloud using the fused feature. This\ndeformation process completes and deforms the point cloud\nshape in the feature space, resulting in feature maps of the\ndeformed point cloud.\nWe begin by applying three MLP layers to Frgb and Fo,\ngenerating the query, key,and value inputs for the SA mod-\nule. which can be calculated by\nF\u0003= SA(F\u0003) (1)\nwhere \u0003 2 frgb;ogindicates the parameters of RGB and\npoint cloud, respectively.\nNext, we utilize another SA module based on Frgb and\nFo to perform further feature extraction using a similar op-\neration. The resulting feature maps for the RGB images and\npoint cloud are denoted asFrgb 2RNo\u0002C and Fo 2RNo\u0002C,\nrespectively.\nThen, we compute the query, key,and value inputs for the\ncross-attention (CA) module based on the extracted features\nFrgb and Fo. The objective of the CA model is to combine\nFo and Frgb, resulting in the deformation offsets featuresOo\nand Orgb. The fusion is computed as\nOi = softmax\n \nqc\ni \u0002(kc\nj)T\npdk\n!\nvc\nj (2)\nwhere i;j 2frgb;og and i6= j.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6810\nFinally, we adjust the feature maps by adding the defor-\nmation offsets, which can be calculated as F\u0003 = F\u0003+ O\u0003,\nwhere \u00032frgb;og.\nOnce we have adjustedFrgb and Fo, we concatenate them\nalong the channel dimension, resulting in instance local-\nwise features denoted as Fins\nlocal 2RNo\u0002C. Subsequently, we\nemploy an MLP layer to generate the instance global-wise\nfeatures represented by Fins\nglobal 2RNo\u0002C.\nBoth the coarse deformation and ﬁne deformation mod-\nules function in a similar manner, as they deform objects by\npredicting the deformation offset in the feature space.

This graph module incorporates a\ntransformer structure, which is illustrated in Figure 3.\nq\nk\nv\nInput\nSoftmax\nq\nOutput\nA\nAttention map\nAdd\nMultiply\nFigure 3: The structure of the graph module.\nUsing the fused feature F 2 RB\u0002N\u0002D as input, we\ngenerate the query, key,and value, which indicate by q 2\nRB\u0002N\u0002Dq , k 2 RB\u0002N\u0002Dk , and v 2 RB\u0002N\u0002Dv respec-\ntively, where B represents the batch size, and D\u0003;\u0003 2\nfq;k;v gindicates the feature dimension.\nNext, we normalize the q and v tensors, and apply the\nsoftmax function to the ktensor.\nTo generate multiple graph features, we ﬁrst divide qinto\nseveral heads, resulting in q 2RB\u0002N\u0002H\u0002(Dq=H), where H\ndenotes the number of heads. We set Dq=H = Dk = Dv\nand utilize the Einstein summation convention (einsum) for\nperforming matrix multiplication in the transformer.\nThen, we follow the calculation process of the transformer\nand calculate the attention map, which can be got byattn=\nk\nv, where \nindicates the einsum, attn 2RB\u0002Dk\u0002Dv\nindicates the attention map.\nNext, we generate the adjusted features with the attention\nmap:\nFattn = q\nattn (3)\nwhere Fattn 2RB\u0002N\u0002H\u0002Dv indicates the adjusted feature\nmap.\nThen, we generate multi-graph features on the value\nbranch. First, we create a random graph adjacency matrix\nAto establish a graph G, which can be computed by\nG= v\nA (4)\nwhere A2RDv\u0002Dv\u0002Dk , G2RB\u0002N\u0002Dk\u0002Dv .\nTo establish a graph on itself, we add a self-loop to the v\ntensor by v= v+ I, where I represents the identity matrix.\nWe reshape vinto RB\u0002N\u0002Dv\u0002Dv and add it to the graph\nG. Using G, we establish the relationship between v and q\nby\nFG = q\nG (5)\nwhere FG 2RB\u0002N\u0002H\u0002Dv indicates the graph features.\nFinally, we add the FG and Fattn tensors together to ob-\ntain Ff . Then, we can get the ﬁnal graph feature Ffin by\nFfin = MLP(Ff ) +F, where MLP indicates MLP lay-\ners.\nDue to space limits, we have added more details and mo-\ntivation of graph module into the supplementary material.\n3.4 Recurrent Reﬁnement Module\nIn this part, we deform the prior point cloud Pr by Fins\nglobal\nand Fcat\nglobal in the feature space. We predict the deformation\noffset O and the point cloud transformation matrix T. We\nuse O to adjust and deform the shape of Pr, while T gener-\nates the NOCS model from the deformed point cloud.\nThe initial transform matrix and deformation offset for\nobjects are T0 2RNo\u0002(Nr\u0002c) and O0 2RNr\u0002(c\u00023). Here,\ncrepresents the number of object categories.\nFor a speciﬁc object k 2c, the corresponding deformed\npoint cloud is Pr. The initial point cloud transformation\nmatrix and deformation offset are T(k)\n0 2 RNo\u0002Nr and\nO(k)\n0 2RNr\u00023.\nWe perform the ﬁrst deformation on Pr with the initial\ndeformation offset,P(1)\nr = Pr+O(k)\n0 , where P(1)\nr represents\nthe deformed prior point cloud.\nThen, we update the category local-wise and global-wise\nfeatures based on the P(1)\nr that is\nFcat\nlocal(1) = MLP(P(1)\nr );Fcat\nglobal(1) = AVE(Fcat\nlocal) (6)\nwhere AVE indicates average global pooling layer.\nAfter that, we use Fcat\nglobal(1) with previous features to fur-\nther update the offset and transformation matrix:\nO1 = MLP( c\r(Fcat\nglobal(1);Fcat\nglobal(0))) (7)\nT1 = MLP( c\r(Fcat\nglobal(1);Fins\nglobal(0))) (8)\nwhere c\r(\u0003;\u0003) indicates concatenation, Fcat\nglobal(0) = Fcat\nglobal\nand Fins\nglobal(0) = Fins\nglobal.\nThen we update the deformation offset and transformation\nmatrix: O1  O1 + O0, T1  T1 \u0002T0. By repeatedly\nperforming such a process, we can deform the prior point\ncloud several times, which can be expressed as\nOi+1 = MLP( c\r(Fcat\nglobal(i+1);Fcat\nglobal(0))) (9)\nOi+1  Oi+1 + Oi (10)\nTi+1 = MLP( c\r(Fcat\nglobal(i+1);Fins\nglobal(i))) (11)\nTi+1  Ti+1 \u0002Ti (12)\nDue to space limits, we also provide the pseudocode of\nthis algorithm in the supplementary material.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6811\n3.5 Loss Function\nWe can transform the instance object into the NOCS space\nusing the ﬁnal prediction of deformation offset O and point\ncloud transformation matrix T. The resulting equation is ex-\npressed as PNOCS = softmax(T) \u0002(Pr + O).\nCorrespondence Loss Based on PNOCS , we can trans-\nform the object into NOCS space, we use the smoothL1 loss\nto calculate the correspondence loss\nLcorr = S(PNOCS ;Pgt)\nwhere S indicates smooth L1 loss, Pgt is the ground truth.\nReconstruction Loss To evaluate the performance of de-\nformation of the network, following the ideas in (Tian, Ang,\nand Lee 2020), we use the Chamfer distance to penalize the\ndeformation\nLr(M;Mgt) =\nX\ni2Mi\nmin\nj2Mj\ngt\njji\u0000jjj2\n2 +\nX\nj2Mj\ngt\nmin\ni2Mi\njji\u0000jjj2\n2\nwhere M = Pr +O is the prediction of the object 3D model,\nMgt is the ground truth 3D model.\nDistribution Loss Following (Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020),\nWe also try to encourage T to be a peaked distribution by\nminimizing the average cross-entropy loss, which can be\ncalculated by\nLdis = 1\nNo\nX\ni\nX\nj\n(\u0000softmax(Ti;j) log(softmax(Ti;j)))\nDeformation Loss To avoid overﬁtting and large defor-\nmations, we also use the O with L2 regularization to realize\nit, Ldef = 1\nNo\nP\ni2O jjijj2\nTotal Loss The total loss of the CatFormer is the sum of\nthe four losses\nL=\nnX\nk=0\n\u0015corrLcorr + \u0015rLr + \u0015disLdis + \u0015def Ldef\nwhere \u0015\u0003is the weight of the loss function, nis the number\nof the object in the scene.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Datasets\nThe benchmark datasets for category-level object pose esti-\nmation are the REAL275 dataset and CAMERA25 dataset,\nproposed in (Wang et al. 2019b). The CAMERA25 dataset\nconsists of 300K images, with 25K images used for evalua-\ntion. It is generated by rendering synthetic objects into real\nscenes. On the other hand, the REAL275 dataset contains\n4300 real-world training images from 7 scenes, and 2750\nreal-world evaluation images from 6 scenes. Both datasets\ninclude 6 different categories of objects: bottle, bowl, cam-\nera, can, laptop, and mug. For instance-level 6D pose esti-\nmation, the LINEMOD dataset (Hinterstoisser et al. 2011)\nserves as the benchmark. It comprises 13 different objects\nrandomly placed in real scenes.\n4.2 Training Details\nAll experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA GeForce\nRTX 3090 GPU with 24 GB memory, running Ubuntu 18.04\nas the operating system. PyTorch 1.8.1 is utilized as the\ndeep learning framework, and CUDA 11.1 is employed for\naccelerated training. The network is trained with a batch\nsize of 16 for 60 epochs. The initial learning rate is set to\n1 \u000210\u00004, gradually decreasing to 1 \u000210\u00006. We also set\n\u0015corr = \u0015r = \u0015def = 1in this paper.\n4.3 Preprocessing\nTo process the dataset, we follow the procedures outlined in\n(Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020). We employ an instance segmen-\ntation network, such as Mask-RCNN (He et al. 2017), for\nobject detection and segmentation. For each segmented in-\nstance, we crop the object and resize the image to192 \u0002192\npixels. Using the RGB-D images and the camera’s intrinsic\nmatrix, we generate a point cloud of the scene. From this\npoint cloud, we randomly select 1024 points for each ob-\nject. The cropped images and selected points are then used\nas inputs for CatFormer.\n4.4 Evaluation Metrics\nWe evaluate the performance of CatFormer using widely\nused evaluation metrics (Wang et al. 2019b; Tian, Ang,\nand Lee 2020; Lin et al. 2021; Di et al. 2022; Lin et al.\n2022a). For rotation and translation evaluation, we utilize\n3D Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with thresholds of 0.25,\n0.5, and 0.75. Additionally, we employ 5\u000e2cm, 5\u000e5cm,\n10\u000e2cm, and 10\u000e5cmto directly assess rotation and trans-\nlation accuracy. If the errors fall within the thresholds, the\npredictions are deemed correct. Based on these evaluation\nmetrics, we will use overall mAP to assess the performance\nof CatFormer compared to other SOTA methods.\n4.5 Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods\nWe present the quantitative results of CatFormer compared\nto recent state-of-the-art methods on the CAMERA25 and\nREAL275 datasets in Table 1.\nCatFormer exhibits slightly superior performance to\nSOTA methods on the CAMERA25 dataset. This can be at-\ntributed to the accurate depth images generated in a simu-\nlated real scene, unaffected by environmental factors. Con-\nsequently, point cloud completion has not provided signif-\nicant enhancements in pose estimation. However, on the\nREAL275 dataset, where all images are captured in the real\nworld, the depth images can be inﬂuenced by object reﬂec-\ntions or lighting conditions, resulting in incomplete informa-\ntion and imperfect point clouds. In such cases, transformer-\nbased point cloud completion and deformation have demon-\nstrated their effectiveness. Notably, for the IoU50 metric,\nCatFormer outperforms SOTA HS-Pose (Zheng et al. 2023)\nwith a score of 83.1 compared to 82.1. Speciﬁcally, in the\nmost challenging 5\u000e2cmmetric, CatFormer achieves a score\nof 47.7, surpassing the previous SOTA method HS-Pose\nat 46.5, indicating higher accuracy. Additionally, for the\n10\u000e2cmmetric, CatFormer also demonstrates improved per-\nformance with a score of 69.0 compared to HS-Pose’s 68.6.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6812\nMethod CAMERA25 REAL275\nIoU50 IoU75 5\u000e2cm5\u000e5cm10\u000e2cm10\u000e5cmIoU25 IoU50 IoU75 5\u000e2cm5\u000e5cm10\u000e2cm10\u000e5cm\nNOCS(Wang et al. 2019b)(R) 83.9 69.5 32.3 40.9 48.2 64.6 84.9 78.0 30.1 7.2 9.5 13.8 25.2\nSPD(Tian, Ang, and Lee 2020)(R) 93.2 83.1 54.3 59.0 73.3 81.5 83.0 77.3 53.2 19.2 21.4 43.2 54.1\nSGPA(Chen and Dou 2021)(R) 93.2 88.1 70.7 74.5 82.7 88.4 - 80.1 61.9 35.9 39.6 61.3 70.7\nCR-Net(Wang, Chen, and Dou 2021)(R) 93.8 88.0 72.0 76.4 81.0 87.7 79.3 55.9 27.8 34.3 47.2 60.8\nFS-Net\u0003(Chen et al. 2021)(D) - - - - - - 84.0 81.1 63.5 19.9 33.9 - 69.1\nDualPoseNet(Lin et al. 2021)(R) 92.4 86.4 64.7 70.7 77.2 84.7 - 79.8 62.2 29.3 35.9 50.0 66.8\nSAR-Net(Lin et al. 2022a)(D) 86.8 79.0 66.7 70.9 75.3 80.3 - 79.3 62.4 31.6 42.3 50.3 68.3\nGPV-Pose(Di et al. 2022)(D) 93.4 88.3 72.1 79.1 - 89.0 84.2 83.0 64.4 32.0 42.9 - 73.3\nHS-Pose(Zheng et al. 2023)(D) 93.3 89.4 73.3 80.5 80.4 89.4 84.2 82.1 74.7 46.5 55.2 68.6 82.7\nSPD+GM 93.6 87.9 61.4 66.3 78.0 85.4 83.6 80.5 59.5 20.4 24.4 47.7 58.7\nCR-Net+GM 93.9 88.8 72.8 76.0 82.4 88.3 83.2 79.8 64.5 32.9 37.5 53.1 63.4\nSGPA+GM 93.5 86.1 73.8 77.7 83.9 89.0 84.0 81.3 65.3 36.5 40.6 62.9 71.1\nOurs(R) 93.5 89.9 74.9 79.8 85.3 90.2 84.3 83.1 73.8 47.7 53.7 69.0 79.5\nTable 1: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on CAMERA25 dataset and REAL275 dataset.

Figure 4 shows the\nqualitative analysis of CatFormer and the state-of-the-art\nRGB-D based method SGPA on the REAL275 dataset. In\ncomparison to SGPA, CatFormer exhibits higher accuracy\nin pose estimation.

The\nbounding box in green line is the ground truth, and the red\nline is the prediction.\nIn this paper, we propose an innovative transformer-based\ngraph module. By incorporating the graph module into Cat-\nFormer, we observe a signiﬁcant improvement in perfor-\nmance, highlighting its effectiveness. To further validate the\nefﬁcacy of the graph module, we also apply it to other RGB-\nD-based methods such as SPD, CR-Net, SGPA. The experi-\nmental results are presented in Table 1. The experimental re-\nsults demonstrate that incorporating the graph module into\nthe network leads to improved performance. For instance,\nwhen we apply the graph module after RGB-D future fusion\nin SPD, the 5\u000e2cmmetric shows a signiﬁcant enhancement\nfrom 54.3 to 61.4, indicating a substantial improvement.\n4.6 Ablation Studies\nThe REAL275 dataset, being more challenging than the\nCAMERA25 dataset, provides a better evaluation of the\nnetwork’s performance. Therefore, we primarily utilize the\nREAL275 dataset for conducting ablation studies. These\nstudies focus on evaluating the proposed module, the num-\nber of reﬁnement iterations, and the loss terms.\nModule: We begin by conducting ablation studies on the\nproposed module, with the corresponding experimental re-\nsults presented in Table 2(A). Firstly, when the graph mod-\nule is removed, CatFormer’s performance decreases, indi-\ncating the effectiveness of the graph module in establishing\nconnections between different features. However, removing\neither the coarse deformation or ﬁne deformation module\ncauses a more signiﬁcant drop in CatFormer’s performance,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of point cloud deformation\nand completion.\nRepeat Times: In addition, we assess the efﬁcacy of the\nrecurrent reﬁnement module by reﬁning the initial point\ncloud multiple times. Speciﬁcally, we conduct reﬁnements\n1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 times in this study, with the corresponding\nexperimental results presented in Table 2(B). As the num-\nber of reﬁnement iterations increases, there is a gradual im-\nprovement in the network’s performance, reaching its peak\nat ﬁve iterations. However, further increasing the number of\niterations leads to a decline in the network’s performance.\nLoss Terms: Given the necessity of predicting the NOCS\nmodel of the object, the Lcorr term plays a crucial role. The\nexperimental results are summarized in Table 2(C). It is evi-\ndent from the results that relying solely onLcorr yields poor\nnetwork performance. However, when Lcorr is combined\nwith Ldis, CatFormer demonstrates relatively improved per-\nformance.\nAdditionally, removing Ldis results in a signiﬁcant de-\ncrease in network performance. Each row in matrix T can\nbe considered as a relaxed one-hot vector, allowing a point\nin the NOCS space to be transformed by up to three points in\nthe point cloud. We aim for T to have a peaked distribution,\nfocusing on high-conﬁdence transformations. This concen-\ntration of conﬁdence enhances the accuracy of the predicted\nNOCS model.\nLastly, we utilize Ldef to mitigate excessive deformation\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6813\nGroup Module Repeat Times Loss Terms REAL275\nCD FD GM Lcorr Lr Ldis Ldef IoU50 IoU75 5\u000e2cm 5\u000e5cm 10\u000e2cm 10\u000e5cm\n(A)\nX 3 X X X X 79.0 54.1 32.5 35.9 60.1 69.8\nX 3 X X X X 81.2 65.9 38.9 42.7 62.9 72.9\nX 3 X X X X 80.0 51.7 29.8 33.4 59.6 69.7\nX X 3 X X X X 79.8 67.7 37.7 42.5 63.9 74.0\nX X 3 X X X X 81.7 66.2 40.3 44.3 64.5 74.6\nX X 3 X X X X 80.9 56.0 34.9 38.5 61.1 71.9\n(B)\nX X X 1 X X X X 82.5 68.0 43.0 47.6 65.7 76.0\nX X X 3 X X X X 82.6 69.5 44.5 47.6 65.3 76.7\nX X X 4 X X X X 82.8 71.6 46.8 50.1 67.2 78.4\nX X X 5 X X X X 83.1 73.8 47.7 53.7 69.0 79.5\nX X X 6 X X X X 82.4 70.6 46.2 49.5 68.4 78.3\nX X X 7 X X X X 82.1 68.1 43.3 48.0 66.8 77.0\n(C)\nX X X 3 X X 74.9 34.9 41.6 46.0 66.0 75.4\nX X X 3 X X X 78.9 44.9 41.9 46.8 64.8 74.8\nX X X 3 X X X 82.2 68.0 42.0 47.1 64.3 75.4\nX X X 3 X 1.5 1.0 30.5 34.7 50.8 56.3\nX X X 3 X X 0.0 0.0 3.3 3.3 14.2 14.6\nX X X 3 X X 81.9 67.3 38.5 43.3 61.5 71.6\nX X X 3 X X X 81.8 68.1 42.0 47.1 63.8 75.4\nTable 2: Ablation studies on different conﬁgurations of network on REAL275.

RGB-D images\nare obtained using an Intel RealSense D435i camera, while\nsegmentation is performed using a pretrained Mask-RCNN\nmodel. The pose estimation results, shown in Figure 5, in-\ndicate that CatFormer exhibits good generalization and per-\nforms well in real-world object pose estimation tasks.\nFigure 5: Object pose estimation results of CatFormer in the\nreal world.\n4.8 Instance-Level Object Pose Estimation\nCatFormer is also applied to instance-level object pose\nestimation in this study. The LINEMOD dataset (Hinter-\nstoisser et al. 2011) is used for conducting the instance-\nlevel object pose estimation experiment. By comparing Cat-\nFormer’s performance with other state-of-the-art methods\non the LINEMOD dataset, the experimental results, dis-\nplayed in Table 3, indicate that CatFormer outperforms re-\nlated category-level methods and achieves competitive per-\nformance compared to some state-of-the-art instance-level\nmethods. For symmetric objects, we utilize ADD-S as the\nmetric (Xiang et al. 2018), while for non-symmetric objects,\nwe employ ADD as the metric (Hinterstoisser et al. 2012).\nWe also provide more details of instance-level object pose\nestimation in the supplementary material.\nMethod C.L.

CatFormer leverages\ntransformer-based deformation modules for both coarse and\nﬁne deformations. Additionally, we propose a graph mod-\nule to establish and extract graph features from fused fea-\ntures. To further reﬁne the prior point’s proximity to the\ntarget object, we introduce a recurrent reﬁnement mod-\nule. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, our\napproach demonstrates superior performance on both the\nCAMERA25 dataset and REAL275 dataset. Furthermore,\nCatFormer achieves successful results in instance-level ob-\nject pose estimation and real-world object pose estimation\ntasks.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6814\nAcknowledgments\nThe work was supported by the National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China under Grant 62173035, Grant\n61803033 and Grant 61836001, and in part by the Xiaomi\nYoung Scholars from Xiaomi Foundation, and in part by\nthe BIT Research and Innovation Promoting Project under\nGrant 2023YCXY035.\nReferences\nChen, D.; Li, J.; Wang, Z.; and Xu, K. 2020a.
