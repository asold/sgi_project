Decreasing \ncosts and widespread adoption of commercialized protocols, such as the 10X Genom -\nics platform, have made single-cell RNA sequencing ubiquitous across biological dis -\nciplines. To mitigate resource wastage from redundant sequencing, third-party public \ndatasets have become indispensable for research discovery and validation. Consequently, \nlarge-scale, curated single-cell “atlas” datasets have emerged for critical and complex dis-\neases [2].\nCollaborative efforts like the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) [3 ] and crowdsourcing \nplatform such as the cellxgene [4 ] platform have driven the generation of extensive, \nmulti-species, cross-tissue, and multi-omics cellular datasets. As of August 9, 2024, \n*Correspondence:   \ntangfuchou@pku.edu.cn\n1 Biomedical Pioneering \nInnovation Center, School of Life \nSciences, Peking University, \nBeijing 100871, China\n2 Beijing Advanced Innovation \nCenter for Genomics (ICG), \nMinistry of Education Key \nLaboratory of Cell Proliferation \nand Differentiation, Beijing, China\nPage 2 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \ncellxgene, the largest literature-curated single-cell database, encompasses 1458 data -\nsets, primarily human and mouse single-cell RNA sequencing data. However, this \nprogress is overshadowed by the annual influx of thousands of publications with novel \nsingle-cell sequencing datasets (Fig.  1A). These discrete datasets span fundamental \ncellular processes to diverse human pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenera -\ntive disorders, and immunological conditions. Effective utilization of these resources \ncould enhance understanding from common to rare diseases with diverse cellular \nstates while facilitating the construction of a comprehensive, multi-dimensional cel -\nlular landscape across a wide variety of tissues, developmental time points, diseases, \nand treatment conditions, thereby reducing research inefficiencies.\nCurrent data sharing protocols only mandate submission of raw sequencing data, \nwithout requiring processed expression matrices. While some publications provide \ncell-level annotations based on cellular barcodes in supplementary materials, these \nare often already incorporated into public datasets. Many smaller-scale published \ndatasets frequently lack accessible single-cell level annotations. This deficiency cre -\nates a significant barrier for data integration, necessitating time-consuming manual \nreview of articles to extract preprocessing methodologies and marker gene descrip -\ntions before dataset processing—an approach that becomes untenable when con -\nstructing large-scale integrated datasets from literature.\nAutomated annotation of single-cell datasets using reference label transfer methods \noffers an alternative strategy [5]. However, this approach limits the discovery of novel \ncell types unique to smaller datasets and requires comprehensive, high-quality reference \nlabels, often unavailable for many disease subtypes. Another method involves integrating \nunlabeled datasets using batch correction algorithms [6], followed by unified clustering \nand annotation. Nevertheless, existing batch correction methods tend to favor predomi -\nnant cell types, potentially over-integrating dataset-specific rare cell populations.\nRecent advancements in natural language processing and general-purpose large lan -\nguage models (LLMs) have expanded their applications to extracting structured bio -\nlogical knowledge. Cell annotation methods utilizing LLMs like GPT-4 have shown \nimpressive performance in evaluations [7]. However, applying these methods to \nFig. 1 Workflow of scExtract. A Bar chart comparing the annual number of newly published single-cell \nsequencing articles versus datasets available on crowdsourcing platforms. B Schematic workflow illustrating \nthe integration and annotation steps of scExtract. Individual datasets are first processed separately by the \nLLM agent, including preprocessing and annotation, before being merged together using annotation-based \nprior information for integration. C Scatter plot showing that Scanorama-prior utilizes label prior information \nto facilitate integration. D Scatter plot showing that Scanorama-prior better preserves the internal structure \nof cell clusters during integration. Left panel: During integration, Scanorama calculates mutual nearest pairs \nbetween two batches and determines the integration displacement vector (light gray arrows) through \nmutual nearest neighbor pairs. Scanorama-prior builds upon this by additionally considering the relative \npositions of cells within the clusters (gray dotted arrows). Middle panel: In Scanorama integration, cells \nmove according to the original light gray displacement vectors, causing all Batch 1 cells to shift to the \nupper portion of Batch 2. Right panel: Scanorama-prior considers relative positions, using gray arrows for \ndisplacement, resulting in better preservation of internal structure. E Cellhint-prior dynamically adjusts the \nweights of prior knowledge based on the uncertainty of cell population assignments. When uncertainty is \nhigher during the integration process, cellhint-prior incorporates a greater proportion of prior knowledge, \nensuring the cautious introduction of prior information\n(See figure on next page.)\nPage 3 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \nFig. 1 (See legend on previous page.)\nPage 4 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \nautomatically process article data presents several challenges. These include conducting \ncell filtration and preprocessing based on article information, determining optimal clus -\ntering granularity that aligns with the authors’ biological understanding, and leveraging \narticle-derived prior information for marker gene-based cell type annotation. Incorpo -\nrating this contextual knowledge is likely to yield superior performance compared to \napproaches that do not consider such article-specific information.\nIn light of these characteristics, we have developed scExtract, a novel framework based \non large language models for fully automated extraction and integration of published \nsingle-cell RNA-seq data using an annotation-aware approach. scExtract requires only \nraw expression matrices and article content as input, automatically performing pre -\nprocessing, clustering, and annotation operations aligned with the original methods \ndescribed in the articles. Furthermore, scExtract enables integration in a prior-depend -\nent manner, utilizing previous automated annotations with modified versions of scano -\nrama [8] and cellhint [9], which outperform original methods that do not incorporate \nprior knowledge across various metrics.\nIn articles with well-annotated datasets, scExtract demonstrates higher accuracy sur -\npassing current established methods across tissues. We further leveraged the advan -\ntages of annotation by developing scExtract’s integration pipeline, which incorporates \nannotations as prior knowledge. Through comparative analyses across multiple datasets \nof varying scales, we demonstrated that scExtract’s integration method not only exhib -\nited enhanced batch correction results while preserving biological diversities, but also \ndemonstrated robust performance even with some ambiguous or erroneous labels. By \ncombining annotation and integration capabilities, scExtract enables rapid and accurate \nintegration of published single-cell omics datasets.\nWe applied this comprehensive pipeline to 14 skin scRNA-seq datasets encompass -\ning various conditions, automatically constructing a skin immune dysregulation data -\nset comprising over 440,000 cells. Analysis of this integrated dataset validated different \nactivation program of T helper cells across various diseases. Detailed subgroup analysis \nrevealed characteristic cell cluster expansion of proliferating keratinocytes in psoriasis, \none of the most prevalent autoimmune skin disorders. These findings highlight the util -\nity and effectiveness of scExtract framework in uncovering novel biological insights from \ndiverse single-cell omics sequencing datasets.\nResults\nArticle‑based automated dataset process of scExtract\nscExtract’s automated processing pipeline consists of two components: LLM-based auto-\nmatic annotation incorporating article background information, and cell-type harmoni -\nzation with embedding integration guided by annotation information (Fig.  1B). In the \nannotation phase, we implemented an LLM agent that emulates human expert analysis, \nautomatically processing datasets while incorporating article background information. \nFor the integration phase, to optimize the annotated data processing, we utilized the \npreliminary annotation information. We modified two well-performing software pack -\nages, scanorama and cellhint, and integrated them in a pipeline that leverages approxi -\nmate annotations to enhance dataset integration.\nPage 5 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \nIn annotation stage, scExtract employs scanpy [10], the standard Python framework \nfor single-cell data analysis, to perform computations. The standard processing pipe -\nline includes cell filtering, preprocessing, unsupervised clustering, and cell population \nannotation. scExtract emulates the workflow adopted by human researchers in actual \nsingle-cell data annotation (Fig.  1B) (Methods), by extracting parameters used in each \nstep from the article text and implementing them using the scanpy system. For instance, \nif the target article mentions in the “Methods” section, “We filtered out cells with ≥ 20% \nmitochondrial genes, ” scExtract would extract this parameter and execute the corre -\nsponding computation.\nIn the clustering phase, scExtract’s prompts include two aspects: it can extract the \nnumber of cluster groups from the article as an external parameter, and when the article \ndoes not explicitly state the number of groups, it can infer from the article’s content, \nsuch as the number of cell populations discussed or the granularity of annotations. This \nmethod leverages the authors’ prior knowledge, which is crucial for preserving maxi -\nmal biological significance in the clustering process. While algorithms exist for selecting \noptimal cluster numbers in unsupervised clustering, they are often not applied in practi -\ncal data analysis due to their potential unreliability in capturing biologically meaningful \ndistinctions.\nDuring the annotation phase, similar to previous work utilizing LLMs for cell annota -\ntion, scExtract takes marker gene lists for each group as input. However, it also incor -\nporates the article’s background knowledge, ensuring that annotation results align more \nclosely with the article’s content. To better mitigate hallucinations in LLM information \nextraction and differences in the implementation platform of processing workflows, \nscExtract can optimize previous annotations after the initial annotation by autono -\nmously querying the expression levels of a set of characteristic marker genes. This gene \nset is generated by scExtract based on the article and existing tissue and cell type infor -\nmation, inferring potential cell populations in the current microenvironment and char -\nacteristic genes of annotated but low-confidence groups. After obtaining the expression \nlevels of these genes across different groups, scExtract can further optimize its previous \nannotations.\nThe next step in constructing a fully automated dataset is to integrate the data anno -\ntated by scExtract. However, the majority of conventional integration methods fail to \nleverage prior annotation information. To overcome these limitations, we developed \nscanorama-prior. Scanorama-prior requires additional clustering information and a \nsimilarity matrix of cell annotations at the embedding level, both from the scExtract \nprocessing pipeline. When constructing mutual nearest neighbors (MNN), scanorama-\nprior considers the prior differences between cell types (Fig.  1C), adjusting the weighted \ndistances between cells across datasets, thereby achieving more accurate neighbor \nconstruction.\nAdditionally, when shifting cells between datasets, scanorama-prior tends to move \noriginal cell groups as cohesive units towards corresponding groups in the target data -\nset. To enhance batch correction, it applies an additional adjustment vector based on the \npositions of cell group centers in both datasets. The weight of this adjustment vector is \ndetermined by the annotation similarity between the original and target groups. Con -\nsequently, if two groups exhibit similar expression patterns and identical annotations, \nPage 6 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \nthey will be more uniformly integrated (Fig.  1D). This approach ensures that biological \nrelationships are preserved while effectively mitigating batch effects.\nWhile possessing various advantages, scanorama-prior exhibits sensitivity to anno -\ntation errors, a characteristic we detailed in the benchmark section. To address this \nlimitation, we incorporated cellhint-prior into scExtract’s integration method. Cellhint, \noriginally designed for cluster-level integration, serves as an ideal downstream comple -\nment to rough annotations. Cellhint’s methodology can be employed to rectify previous \nannotations and provide harmonized annotations through cross-dataset comparisons. \nTo mitigate potential interference from prior information, we adopted a conservative \napproach in incorporating prior knowledge by adjusting annotation weights based on \ncell alignment uncertainty levels (Fig. 1E)(Methods).\nscExtract implements a stepwise integration process for automatically annotated \ndatasets (Fig.  1B). The process begins with cellhint-prior for cell type harmonization, \nleveraging neighboring datasets as references to rectify potential nomenclature incon -\nsistencies stemming from LLM output variations. When embedding-level integration is \nnecessary, scanorama-prior is applied to the harmonized cell types. The text-to-embed -\nding approach’s flexibility in cell type input format enables the similarity matrix to be \nderived from harmonized cell types. This pipeline effectively addresses both annota -\ntion harmonization and embedding integration challenges in heterogeneous single-cell \nomics datasets.\nEvaluating clustering and annotation accuracy using cellxgene data\nWe utilized manually annotated datasets from cellxgene to assess annotation accuracy. \nWe randomly selected 21 medium-scale annotated datasets (on the order of  104 cells), 18 \nof which possessed diverse cell types (Fig.  2A, Additional file 2: Table S1) [11–27]. These \n(See figure on next page.)\nFig. 2 scExtract automatically annotates published datasets with high accuracy. A Schematic workflow of \nthe cellxgene datasets benchmark annotation task.

We compared \nscExtract with three established methods, including SingleR [28], scType [29], and Cell -\nTypist [30] (Methods). To ensure cost-effectiveness when applied to larger-scale data, we \nemployed three model providers supportive of large-scale queries, with longer context \nFig. 2 (See legend on previous page.)\nPage 8 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n(> 128 k tokens) and suitable pricing (≤ $5.00 per 1 M input tokens): Deepseek-v2.5 [31], \nGPT-4o-mini [32], and Claude-3.5-sonnet [33].\nWe first evaluated the preservation of group structure in single-cell RNA-seq \ndatasets across different automatic annotation methods. Regarding the discrepancy \nbetween annotated cell type numbers and those reported in the original articles, \nSingleR and CellTypist, which operate at the single-cell annotation level, exhibited \na clear tendency to overestimate cell type numbers due to single-cell level noise. In \ncontrast, scType and scExtract, which utilize marker gene lists for cell group anno -\ntation, demonstrated better correlation with curated cell type numbers (Fig.  2B). \nAmong all model providers used in scExtract, Claude 3.5 tends to overestimate the \nnumber of cell types, while Deepseek-v2.5 and GPT-4o-mini tend to underestimate \nthe number of cell types. We further assessed the clustering performance using the \nAdjusted Rand Index (ARI) (Fig.  2C). Group-level annotation methods demonstrated \nsignificantly higher structural similarity compared to single-cell-level approaches. \nMeanwhile, Claude 3.5, due to its propensity for detailed annotation, displayed the \nlowest ARI among all models.\nTo evaluate annotation accuracy, we employed large language model’s text-to-\nembedding method, converting the annotation information into embeddings and cal -\nculating cosine similarity (Methods). scExtract-based methods demonstrated higher \nmean accuracy than current established methods across all 18 datasets in text-to-\nembedding (Fig.  2D). Moreover, reference transfer methods are more likely to accu -\nrately capture common cell types comprising the majority of the dataset due to their \nfrequent occurrence in reference datasets. We observed that the annotation accu -\nracy of all methods decreased as the cell proportion in the overall dataset declined \n(Fig.  2E). To address this limitation of single-cell level average, we implemented a \ncluster-level accuracy metric that disregards the influence of cell numbers. This met -\nric better reflects the accuracy of automatic annotation for rare cell types. Using this \nmetric, scExtract methods showed a clear advantage (Fig.  2D). The performance dif -\nferences within various language models is less pronounced, with Claude 3.5 dem -\nonstrating the most accurate information extraction capability, followed closely by \nDeepseek v2.5, and then GPT-4o-mini, which is roughly consistent with these mod -\nels’ performance in other domains. Additionally, we also evaluated the relationships \nbetween standard and annotated cell types using Cell-Ontology label (Methods). The \nresults were consistent with embedding-based methods, with a more pronounced \ndisparity between group-level and single-cell-level approaches in reference transfer \nmethods (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A).\nCompared to the previously published GPTCelltype [7 ] method, we hypothesize \nthat scExtract’s superior annotation accuracy stems from its application of article-\nderived prior knowledge and self-reflective capability through two-round annotation. \nDuring the annotating step, scExtract completed its annotations based on background \nand characteristic genes, then reviewed and adjusted the annotation content. For \ninstance, in the annotation of actual datasets, during the second round of annotation, \nscExtract subdivided intercalated cells into two subgroups by querying the expression \nlevels of SLC26A7 and SLC26A4 in the second round (Additional file 1: Fig. S1B-D).\nPage 9 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \nWe evaluated the performance difference between scExtract with and without back -\nground knowledge integration (Fig.  2F). Methods incorporating background knowl -\nedge demonstrated improved accuracy, and we hypothesize that the varying degrees \nof improvement among different models depend on their ability to capture contextual \ninformation from the background text. We also observed that as text was proportion -\nally replaced with confounding contents, annotation accuracy declined to varying \ndegrees, although more sophisticated models like Claude3.5 exhibited a compara -\ntively smaller decrease in performance (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A-B).\nWe directly compared the accuracy of GPTCelltype and scExtract methods on our \ndataset across different models and metrics, with scExtract consistently demonstrating \nsignificant improvements than GPTCelltype (Fig.  2H,I, Additional file  1: Fig. S2C-D). \nWhen assessing annotation accuracy using text-to-embedding methodology, the perfor -\nmance hierarchy was clearly established: scExtract > scExtract (no context) > GPTCell-\ntype. Similarly, in cell ontology-based accuracy measurements, the performance ranking \nwas as follows: scExtract > scExtract (no context) ≈ GPTCelltype. Notably, the perfor -\nmance differences between scExtract (no context) and GPTCelltype varied according to \nthe specific accuracy metric employed. We attribute these variations to inherent meth -\nodological differences in the evaluation approaches. The text-to-embedding method may \nbe more susceptible to formatting inconsistencies, particularly regarding standardized \nCell Ontology annotation usage, whereas the Ontology Look Service (ols_api) effectively \nneutralized these differences by systematically mapping annotations to the standardized \nCell Ontology hierarchical structure.\nTo mitigate the black-box nature of LLMs, we also implemented confidence scoring \nduring the annotation process (Fig.  2G). Results validated that the confidence scores \nprovided by scExtract reliably correlate with actual annotation accuracy.\nscExtract accurately annotated datasets with accordant group structure\nTaking the scExtract-generated dataset of adult human kidney [15] annotated by Claude \n3.5 as a representative example (Fig.  2J). The structure largely aligns with the cluster -\ning in the original article, demonstrating accuracy in annotation granularity. This con -\ntrasts with reference transfer-based methods, which often misclassified single cell types \ninto heterogeneous populations due to expression fluctuations (Fig.  2L). Regarding \nannotation accuracy, most cell clusters were annotated consistently with the original \ndefinitions.\nHowever, a small portion of cells showed lower accuracy (Fig.  2K), typically author-\ndefined cell subtypes more susceptible to language model fluctuations. For instance cells \nannotated as “Unknown” by scExtract (Fig.  2J) were originally defined as PT_VCAM1 \n[15] (subpopulation of proximal tubule with VCAM1 expression). Interestingly, this sub-\ntype was correctly annotated as “Proximal tubule (PT_VCAM1)” in the second repli -\ncates, matched to the original article (Fig.  2N, Additional file 1: Fig. S1D). Among model \nproviders, Claude 3.5’s annotations adhered more closely to the original text, while \nDeepseek v2.5 and GPT-4o-mini tended to reduce the specificity of original expres -\nsions, providing more generic annotations (Additional file  1: Fig. S3A). These obser -\nvations underscore the necessity for further refinement and validation of LLM-based \nannotations.\nPage 10 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \nWe also evaluated the poorer-performing neural tube dataset (Fig.  2D,  Additional \nfile 2: Table S1 dataset 4). Results indicated that scExtract’s lower performance largely \nstemmed from overly broad cell type definitions in the standard dataset, with more accu-\nrate cell type annotations in the original article (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B). For example, \nscExtract’s automatic annotations of two import structures, roof and floor plate cells, \naligned well with marker gene expression patterns (Additional file 1: Fig. S3D). However, \nas clustering complexity and customization increased, annotations required more care -\nful consideration.\nOverall, scExtract maintained granularity and annotation fidelity while operating fully \nautomatically. It can process novel datasets cost-effectively without relying on pre-anno-\ntated reference datasets, offering significant advantages in scalability and extensibility. \nNotably, scExtract can complete all process procedure of a dataset in less than 20 min \n(Additional file 1: Fig. S3E) at a cost of less than one dollar, with no additional computa -\ntional resources required if using web API. Moreover, with the ongoing advancements in \nlanguage models, we anticipate further improvements in precision and efficiency.\nEvaluating scExtract’s output stability and prompt sensitivity\nMajor constraints limiting the applications of large language models in scientific \ndomains include output variability and susceptibility to prompt interference. We next \nassessed the performance of the LLM agent in scExtract with respect to these aspects. \nWe selected Sample1, Sample11, and Sample19 (Additional file 2: Table S1), repeating \nthe analysis of each sample for six times to evaluate performance across two task phases: \nparameter extraction during preprocessing and cell annotation labeling.\nFor preprocessing parameters, high consistency was observed when parameters were \nexplicitly stated in the manuscripts (Additional file 1: Fig. S4A-B). Variability occurred \nprimarily for non-critical parameters not explicitly defined, where the LLM made rea -\nsoned inferences and cautiously set them to “default” rather than fabricating values. \nReduced reproducibility was noted in complex scenarios such as manuscripts contain -\ning multiple datasets with different characteristics, unpublished manuscripts, or custom \nalgorithms (Additional file  1: Fig. S4C). For cell annotations, high reproducibility was \nachieved for most cell types across replicates. Variability was typically confined to cell \nsubpopulations with ambiguous marker profiles (Additional file 1: Fig. S5A). Solid tis -\nsue samples (Samples 11, 19) (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A-B) showed higher annotation \nconsistency than blood samples (Sample 1) (Additional file 1: Fig. S5A). Annotation vari-\nability correlated with cell population heterogeneities and was accurately reflected in the \nmodel’s self-reported certainty levels (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A, S8B). When comparing \ndifferent methods, we observed that strict reproducibility ranked as GPTCelltype > scEx-\ntract (no context) > scExtract (Additional file 1: Fig. S5A-B, S6A). However, this ranking \ninversely correlated with annotation specificity, as more detailed annotations naturally \nintroduced more potential variations. Methods lacking article context failed to identify \nnovel cell subtypes discussed in the original papers (Additional file 1: Fig. S9A-B).\nWe tested prompt sensitivity using Sample 11 with five prompt variants: instruction \nsequence reordering, terminology modification with synonyms, enhanced guidance with \ndetailed instructions, minimalistic annotation with minimal instructions, and structural \nPage 11 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \nreformatting using JSON output format (Methods). Results showed that parameter \nextraction was generally robust across prompt variations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintained \nmore consistent performance with simplified prompts compared to Deepseek v3 (Addi -\ntional file 1: Fig. S10A-B). Similarly, annotation content remained largely stable across \nprompt variants, particularly for well-defined cell types (Additional file  1: Fig. S11A-\nB) (Additional file 3: Table S2). Advanced models demonstrated reduced sensitivity to \nprompt variations (Additional file 1: Fig. S11A-B).\nIn conclusion, scExtract maintains robust performance across multiple replicates and \nprompt variations, particularly for well-defined parameters and cell types. Variabil -\nity occurs primarily in scenarios requiring nuanced interpretations of ambiguous data. \nThe implementation of certainty reporting and detailed reasoning logs provides users \nwith transparency regarding the model’s decision-making process, enabling appropriate \ninterpretation of the results.\nScanorama‑prior enhanced integration of annotated single‑cell omics datasets\nWe evaluated scanorama-prior’s integration performance using pancreas single-cell \nRNA-seq datasets, which utilized different sequencing platforms on pancreas sam -\nples [34]. In contrast to the original version’s integration results, scanorama-prior \nFig. 3 Prior incorporated integration method benchmark of human pancreas dataset.

E UMAP plot demonstrating the integration of pancreatic data in UMAP dimensions using \nCellhint (upper panels) and Cellhint-prior (lower panels)\nPage 12 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \ndemonstrated superior batch effect removal while preserving cell type differences \n(Fig.  3A). Utilizing identical resolution parameters, unsupervised clustering on the \nadjusted embeddings revealed that scanorama’s results displayed more intra-cluster \nseparations resembling batch distributions, primarily due to incomplete batch effect \nremoval. We also benchmarked corrected PCA and UMAP embeddings on batch cor -\nrection and biological diversity preservation [6]. Results showed that scanorama-prior’s \nembeddings in both spaces exhibited superior performance metrics compared to the \noriginal version (Fig. 3B).\nTo evaluate scanorama-prior’s robustness to incorrect labeling, we tested its integra -\ntion performance under three scenarios: similar naming (cell types replaced with aliases \nor alternative nomenclature), unbiased incorrect naming (erroneous naming without \nbias towards existing cell types, e.g., annotated as unknown), and biased incorrect nam -\ning (erroneous naming biased towards existing cell types, e.g., mislabeling one cell type \nas another). Our findings revealed that scanorama-prior performed well in the first two \nscenarios. In the first case, the integration efficacy was essentially indistinguishable from \nthat achieved with strictly identical string inputs (Additional file  1: Fig. S12A). In the \nsecond scenario, the method adopted a more conservative approach to integrate the two \ncell types, yet still managed to merge them based on expression patterns (Additional \nfile 1: Fig. S12B). However, in the third scenario, scanorama-prior received conflicting \ndirectives from two dimensions. Consequently, it refrained from integrating the cells \ninto either group, instead positioning them as outliers between the two clusters (Addi -\ntional file 1: Fig. S12C). This observation underscores the importance of ensuring basic \nsimilarity in annotation types when integrating datasets, or at the very least, avoiding \nbiased incorrect annotations.\nCellhint‑prior enhanced cross‑dataset annotation harmonization with improved tolerance \nfor naming errors\nTo address this challenge in fully automate context, we leveraged a prior-aware version \nof cellhint, which can automatically reconcile annotation discrepancies across datasets. \nEvaluation using pancreas datasets revealed that while the original cellhint excelled \nin integrating inDrop series data, it struggled with Smart-seq2 and Fluidigm C1 plat -\nforms (Fig.  3C). In contrast, the prior-informed cellhint demonstrated superior align -\nment compared to its predecessor. Notably, it successfully aligned cells with severe batch \neffects due to disparities in batch and dataset origins (Fig.  3D, E). This improvement \nunderscores the value of incorporating annotation priors in the cell type alignment pro -\ncess, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data sources. We further evaluated \ncellhint-prior’s performance under those three previously mentioned annotation error \nscenarios. Results demonstrated that the structure of the cell type harmonization tree \nremained consistent with that of correct annotations across all three conditions (Addi -\ntional file 1: Fig. S12F). This stability underscores the method’s enhanced robustness to \nannotation variations.\nPage 13 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \nscExtract’s two‑step automated integration showed robust performance on mis‑annotated \ncell types\nRegarding the previously mentioned annotation error tolerance, we conducted multi -\nple experiments to evaluate the impact of incorrect annotations on the scExtract two-\nstep integration pipeline (Methods). In each experiment, we implemented all three types \nof label changes and isolated the modified data for subsequent benchmark evaluation \n(Additional file  1:  Fig. S12A-C). Our assessment of integration performance metrics \nrevealed that, consistent with previous benchmark results, scanorama-prior with prior \nknowledge performed optimally before label changes, while the use of cellhint for har -\nmonization showed no significant impact (Additional file  1:  Fig.S13A). However, after \nlabel changes, scanorama-prior without cellhint-prior harmonization showed marked \nperformance degradation, while the scExtract’s prior-harmonized version maintained \nrobust performance (Additional file 1:Fig.S13A).\nAdditionally, we performed unsupervised clustering on the post-change embeddings \nand annotated each cell cluster using majority voting. In scenarios where label changes \nresulted in cells being separately clustered, as in previous experiments, these cells would \nbe misclassified. We observed that scanorama-prior-harmonized demonstrated the \nhighest tolerance to annotation errors (Additional file 1: Fig. S13B-F), in some cases sur -\npassing the tolerance of cellhint raw without prior knowledge integration. This pattern \nwas also evident at the embedding level (Additional file 1: Fig.S14A-E). Scanorama-prior, \nobtained through our two-step integration approach, demonstrates optimal merging \nbetween cells with altered type labels (dark labels) and other cells of the same type (light \nbackground). This superior performance is attributed to two key factors: enhanced batch \neffect correction, compared to cellhint, and improved resilience to annotation varia -\ntions, compared to un-harmonized scanorama-prior.\nComprehensive evaluation of large‑scale atlas integration demonstrates the scalable \nsuperiority of scExtract‑based methods\nWe evaluated time performance of our two-step automated integration method on \nconcatenated large datasets (Methods). scanorama-prior, which incorporates a prior \nsimilarity matrix, demonstrated slightly higher time complexity compared to the origi -\nnal scanorama method (Additional file  1:  Fig. S15A) in a PC-level processer. To over -\ncome the computational limitations of scanorama-based methods on large datasets, \nwe implemented GPU acceleration. When executed on a V100 GPU, scanorama-prior \nexhibited speed increase compared to the original no-prior method and demonstrated \nscalability to datasets with one million cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S15B). Notably, in our \nbenchmark tests, cellhint-based methods exhibited significantly longer execution time \ncompared to those reported in the original paper [9] (Additional file 1: Fig. S15B). This \ndiscrepancy arises from our approach of generating large datasets by concatenating \nsmaller ones, where the original dataset size increases proportionally with cell numbers, \nwhich is more reasonable in a real scenario. In contrast, benchmark in the original study \nemployed downsampling from large datasets, maintaining constant original dataset \nnumbers. We observed substantial runtime differences between these two approaches. \nHowever, since our raw datasets were relatively small, this represents an extreme case \nPage 14 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \ndemonstration. In practice, actual execution times are expected to fall between these \ntwo extremes.\nWe further evaluated scExtract’s integration performance on six larger datasets [6, 9, \n35], containing between 50,000 and 600,000 cells in total, representing typical real-world \nintegration scenarios. We first tested the impact of adding general cell type descriptions \nto the integration process. Interestingly, we found virtually no differences in similarity \nmatrices generated using either “cell type” alone or “cell type: description” (Additional \nfile 1: Fig. S16A-B). This suggests that standard cell type designations already serve as \nsufficient sources of prior information. As cellhint’s integration approach modifies cell \nadjacency relationships rather than directly altering embeddings in reduced dimen -\nsional space, we generated 2D UMAP embeddings using identical parameters for bench-\nmarking. In datasets around 50,000 cells level (Fig.  4A, Additional file  1: Fig.  S17A), \nFig. 4 Assessment of scExtract’s two-step integration strategy on large-scale datasets. A–C Systematic \nevaluation of integration performance on Immune cells (A), Blood cells (B), and Human Lung Cell Atlas (C) \ndatasets. Dataset statistics (number of cells, datasets, and cell types) are indicated above each panel. Upper \npanel: UMAP visualizations of embeddings generated by different methods (from left to right): PCA, cellhint \nintegration, cellhint_prior integration, original scanorama, and scExtract’s two-step integration derived \nscanorama_prior.

This was followed by scanorama itself, with cellhint-prior and cell -\nhint showing relatively poor performance. While we anticipated that direct embedding \ndisplacement would be more effective than graph relationship modification for smaller \ndatasets, we hypothesize that single-cell noise might compromise the effectiveness of \nsuch approaches in larger-scale datasets.\nFor datasets containing more than 200,000 cells, we observed substantial variations \nin method performance across different datasets. In the Blood and Spleen datasets, \ncontaining 200,000 and 330,000 cells respectively but only four datasets each, bench -\nmark results indicated that cellhint-prior and cellhint significantly outperformed other \nmethods, with minimal performance differences between them (Fig.  4B, S17B). The \noriginal scanorama showed relatively poor performance, consistent with benchmark \nresults reported in the corresponding literature. However, in the Human Oral Cell Atlas \nand Human Lung Cell Atlas examples, which comprised 250,000 cells/14 datasets and \n580,000 cells/14 datasets, scanorama-prior, derived from our two-step integration, \nregained the leading position, while prior-knowledge-enhanced methods demonstrated \nincreasingly larger advantages over their original counterparts (Fig. 4C, S17C).\nBased on these results, we hypothesize that high-cell-count, low-dataset-number \nconfigurations may compromise the performance of embedding-based methods while \nfavoring graph-construction approaches. From a practical perspective, we recommend \nterminating the integration process at the cellhint-prior step when the average cell num-\nber per dataset exceeds 50,000 or when dealing with fewer than four datasets, as this \napproach may yield optimal results. However, this modification does not diminish the \nsignificance of prior annotation, as both cellhint and cellhint-prior require pre-clustered \ndata input.\nAdditionally, for novel datasets without reference materials, we tested first using \nscExtract (no context) to annotate the datasets, and then integrating them using scEx -\ntract’s two-step approach. We conducted analyses using pancreatic datasets as examples \nand performed three replicates. The overall performance of scExtract (no context) fell \nbetween that of scanorama-prior using standard cell types and the original scanorama \n(Additional file  1: Fig. S18). These results are reasonable from our perspective. When \nexamining specific performance aspects, the batch correction effect of scExtract (no \ncontext) integration was significantly better than the original scanorama, approaching \nthe level of scanorama-prior that directly used standard cell types for integration. How -\never, in terms of biological preservation, scExtract (no context) showed a decline, likely \ndue to potential annotation errors interfering with the integration steps. Notably, across \ndifferent replicates, the composite scores remained highly robust (Additional file 1: Fig. \nS18), consistent with our previous conclusions from the annotation evaluation section.\nAutomated construction of a skin autoimmune disease dataset with custom data \nincorporation\nThe skin serves as a critical barrier for our body, comprising various cell types. It is \ncrucial for skin health to maintain homeostasis within its microenvironment [36]. \nAutoimmune conditions like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) often result from \nPage 16 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \ndysregulated micro-environmental signaling pathways involving complex interactions \namong keratinocytes, immune cells, fibroblasts, and other cellular components [37, 38]. \nDespite recently emerging large-scale datasets [39, 40], they often encompass limited \ndisease phenotypes and require substantial resources for de novo single-cell sequenc -\ning. We utilized scExtract to automatically integrate skin datasets, addressing these \nlimitations.\nWe screened 20 articles for dataset construction (Additional file 4: Table S3), exclud -\ning six due to species mismatch or inconvenient accession of raw data. Phenotype \nlabels were manually curated from NCBI information, with acceleration of scExtract \nby extracting data accession and metadata of samples. Standard automated integration \nprocedures using Claude 3.5 yielded a comprehensive dataset of 440,000 cells from the \nremaining 14 articles (Fig.  5A, B) [41–54]. This integrated dataset encompasses vari -\nous pathologies including psoriasis, AD, acne, and granuloma annulare (GA), as well as \nacross developmental stages from neonates to elderly individuals (Fig. 5C, D).\nTo validate dataset quality, we performed manual clustering using two-step scano -\nrama-prior embedding (Additional file  1: Fig. S19A). To facilitate the annotation of \nintegrated data, scExtract provides an automated fuzzy majority voting method that \nleverages preliminary LLM annotations to generate final annotation results (Additional \nfile  1:  Fig. S19B). The automated annotation results demonstrate strong concordance \nFig. 5 Analysis of scExtract generated human skin single-cell RNA-seq dataset.

We then sought to confirm \nfindings from previously published large-scale datasets. Initially, we isolated T cells \nand reconstructed the kNN-graph and UMAP (Fig.  5F). Consistent with earlier studies \nwhich revealed higher proportion of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in fetal skin, charac -\nterization of the ILC marker gene KLRB1 confirmed its elevated expression in neonatal \nskin (Fig.  5G) [39]. Additionally, we identified distinct T cell expression patterns across \ndisease states, including characteristic expression of IL13 and IL22 in AD, IL17 family \ngenes in psoriasis, and IFNG in granuloma annulare (GA) (Fig.  5H). Concurrently, ele-\nvated PTPRC (encoding CD45) expression in immune-inflammatory lesion cells across \nall conditions indicated increased blood immune cell infiltration (Fig. 5H).\nSubcluster analysis identified distinct proliferating keratinocytes subtypes in psoriasis\nKeratinocytes often exhibit pronounced phenotypes in autoimmune diseases, display -\ning high proliferation activity and impaired differentiation despite diverse inflammatory \nsignals. To explore distinct keratinocyte states across diseases, we conducted a focused \nanalysis on isolated keratinocyte populations.\nUMAP visualization revealed multiple differentiation routes from progenitor to termi-\nnal keratinocytes (Fig. 6A). The psoriatic branch showed markedly elevated expression of \ninflammatory molecules such as S100A8 (Fig. 6C), while keratinocytes from non-lesional \npsoriatic skin exhibited phenotypes similar to healthy keratinocytes, occupying a separate \nbranch. Interestingly, AD keratinocytes were uniformly distributed between these two \nbranches, predominantly occupying intermediate differentiation states (Fig. 6A). Analysis \nof KRT10 expression provided further insights. Despite a higher proportion of KRT10-\nexpressing cells within the AD population, overall expression levels were lower compared \nto other disease states (Fig. 6B). This pattern suggests a higher proportion of differentiated \ncells in AD, but with a lower degree of differentiation.\nWe evaluated the performance differences between prior-knowledge-enhanced integra-\ntion methods and direct integration approaches in distinguishing fine-grained cell types \n(Methods). Our analysis revealed that two-step scanorama-prior effectively integrated cells \nacross different batches, as exemplified by the successful clustering of proliferative keratino-\ncytes from multiple batches (Fig. 6D). In contrast, the original integration method failed to \nproperly merge these keratinocyte populations due to insufficient batch effect correction \n(Fig. 6E, F). Additionally, prior-knowledge-enhanced integration methods showed better \npreserved differentiation trajectories, whereas the original method tended to form more \ncompact, spherical clusters.\nWe isolated proliferating keratinocyte subpopulations based on cell division-related \nmarker genes like MKI67 and performed subcluster analysis (Fig. 6C). Analysis of disease-\nspecific proportions within subclusters revealed shared and disease-enriched populations \n(Fig. 6G). Clusters 2 and 7 were shared across diseases and healthy states, while psoriasis-\nenriched (clusters 0, 1, 6) and AD-enriched (clusters 4) populations were also identified.\nDifferential gene expression analysis of these subclusters revealed distinctive features \n(Fig. 6H). The predominant psoriasis-associated cluster (cluster 0) exhibited high COL17A1 \nPage 18 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \nexpression, potentially linked to selection pressures under proliferative signals [55]. Pseudo-\nbulk analysis revealed elevated IGFBP3 expression in this cluster (Fig. 6I). Previous immu-\nnohistochemistry studies have localized IGFBP3 expression to basal layer cells above \nepidermal papillae, a population characterized by lower proliferation capacity [56]. Fur -\nthermore, CXCL14, previously associated with anti-inflammatory effects in psoriasis, was \nalso highly expressed in this cluster (Fig. 6I), in contrast to its overall decrease in psoriatic \nlesions [57]. Notably, a small cluster of cells from normal neonates exhibited similar char-\nacteristics. However, when comparing overall proliferative cell proportions, CXCL14 + pso-\nriatic keratinocytes increased from 35 to 58%, while the corresponding total proportion of \nhealthy cells decreased from 27 to 13%. While typically associated with anti-inflammatory \nFig. 6 Analysis of keratinocyte subpopulations in integrated datasets.

However, \nfurther research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying these gene expres-\nsion changes and their functional implications in the context of psoriasis.\nDiscussion\nThe power of single-cell RNA sequencing technologies in biological research has led to \namazingly fast expansion of single-cell transcriptome data. However, many studies inter-\npret datasets within their own constraints, limiting broader perspectives. Cross-dataset \ncomparisons have emerged as a valuable tool for expanding our understanding, while \nflexible and adaptable reference datasets can yield novel insights in studies focused on \nspecific diseases or biological processes. Nevertheless, in many articles, single-cell level \nannotations are not always uploaded to public repositories in a precise manner. Conse -\nquently, researchers attempting to reproduce these studies often engage in redundant \nwork, with the workload increasing proportionally to the number of datasets incor -\nporated. scExtract streamlines this process by leveraging large language models’ text \ninformation extraction capabilities to eliminate repetitive labor (Fig.  1B). This enables \nresearchers to focus more intently on elucidating biological significance, rather than \ndata preprocessing.\nWe propose that annotation and integration processes in constructing integrated data-\nsets are mutually reinforcing. Previous attempts to utilize annotation information have \nbeen limited by annotation variability and inadequate standardized cell classification \nsystems. This has restricted the application of methods like scANVI [58] and scGen [59], \nwhich rely on strict string matching, while approaches such as cellhint utilizes cluster -\ning information rather than cell type annotations. In cases where hard classification is \nchallenging, continuous representation of annotations offers a promising alternative. \nWhile scExtract, employing current general-purpose text-to-embedding models, has \nshown corrective capabilities (Fig.  3A–D), these models lack domain-specific expertise. \nWe anticipate the development of more specialized text-to-embedding models tailored \nto the biological domain, or even fine-tuned for cell type classification. Such advance -\nments would enable more nuanced extraction of the biological significance from labels. \nWe also envision the incorporation of continuous cell labels into deep learning methods \nlike scANVI, potentially enhancing their adaptability to real-world datasets.\nDespite demonstrating significantly higher accuracy compared to existing automatic \nannotation methods, the pre-harmonized results from scExtract should be interpreted \nwith caution, particularly regarding the nomenclature of more refined cell subtypes. We \nrecommend using cellhint or cellhint-prior to refine cell type annotations, leveraging \nother datasets as references. To facilitate user verification and potential manual correc -\ntion of annotations, scExtract generates comprehensive log files. These logs contain the \nreasoning behind specific cell group annotations and the expression levels of queried \ngenes across different clusters during the re-annotation process.\nIn this study, we utilized the scExtract pipeline to automatically integrate 14 datasets, \nconstructing a comprehensive skin dataset spanning multiple diseases and physiologi -\ncal states (Fig.  5A). Our analysis initially validated conclusions from previous datasets, \nPage 20 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \nthen focused on keratinocytes, particularly proliferating keratinocytes, which were iso -\nlated and independently analyzed. Our investigation identified distinct subpopulation \nexpansion specific to psoriasis, one of the most prevalent autoimmune skin diseases \n(F  ig.  6I), which is associated with anti-inflammatory functions. While past research \non autoimmune diseases has predominantly centered on immune cells, our study high -\nlights the importance of keratinocytes, which constitute the majority of cells in the skin \nmicroenvironment but have been understudied. This example underscores the need \nfor more detailed and standardized research into keratinocyte subpopulations, which \ncould enhance our understanding of their specific roles under various conditions. Fur -\nthermore, our application of scExtract demonstrates its versatility and potential to sig -\nnificantly reduce the manual workload associated with meta-analyses of subpopulations \n[60]. Additionally, scExtract can assist researchers in constructing customized reference \ndatasets tailored to their specific areas of interest.\nIn conclusion, our study not only provides valuable insights into the cellular dynamics \nof skin autoimmune diseases but also showcases the power of automated data integra -\ntion and analysis tools like scExtract. As we continue to unravel the complexities of cel -\nlular heterogeneities in health and disease situations, such tools will be instrumental in \naccelerating discoveries and fostering more comprehensive understanding of biological \nsystems.\nConclusions\nThis study is a novel comprehensive framework for fully automated single-cell RNA-seq \ndata annotation and integration using large language models. scExtract addresses the \ncritical bottleneck of processing abundant public datasets by automatically extracting \nexperimental parameters and biological knowledge from research articles. Our annota -\ntion approach, incorporating article-derived prior knowledge and self-reflective capa -\nbilities, consistently outperformed established reference transfer methods across diverse \ntissue types and cell populations. The integration pipeline, featuring scanorama-prior \nand cellhint-prior, demonstrates superior batch correction while preserving biologi -\ncal diversities compared to conventional methods that ignore annotation information. \nThis framework is particularly valuable for discovering rare cell types and novel biologi -\ncal insights that might be overlooked by reference-based approaches. We successfully \napplied scExtract to construct a comprehensive human skin atlas comprising 440,000 \ncells from 14 datasets, revealing disease-specific keratinocyte subpopulations and \ninflammatory signatures across multiple autoimmune conditions. The identification of \nCXCL14 + proliferating keratinocytes in psoriasis exemplifies scExtract’s capability to \nuncover previously understudied cellular dynamics in complex diseases. By eliminating \nlabor-intensive manual preprocessing and enabling cost-effective integration of pub -\nlished datasets, scExtract democratizes large-scale single-cell analysis and accelerates \nthe construction of tissue-specific atlases. Our framework provides essential infrastruc -\nture for the single-cell omics community to harness the wealth of existing data, facilitat -\ning reproducible research and advancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneities \nin health and disease.\nPage 21 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \nMethods\nscExtract process details\nscExtract requires two primary inputs: the article in PDF format and corresponding raw \ncount-level dataset in h5ad format.

The specific prompts \nfor each step are available in the source code.\n(1) Filtering.\nThis stage eliminates cells with poor quality control (QC) metrics. Thresholds are \napplied to the number of genes expressed per cell, total counts per cell, and the \nnumber of cells expressing each gene. Default parameters, such as a minimum \nof 300 genes expressed per cell, are preset for common 10X single-cell datasets. \nAdditional filters, including upper limits on genes per cell and proportions of \nmitochondrial and ribosomal genes, are only applied if explicitly mentioned in \nthe article and parsed by the language model.\n(2) Preprocessing.\nThis stage prepares the data for clustering. While most parameters use default \nsettings, key adjustable parameters include the number of highly variable genes \nselected, the neighborhood size for kNN graph construction, and the option for \nsample-level batch correction using harmonypy [61].\n(3) Clustering.\nClustering methods (Leiden or Louvain) and the estimated number of cell clusters \nare determined at this stage. scExtract selects an appropriate resolution param -\neter based on the inferred cluster number. In this step, more sophisticated models \ngenerally yield more accurate parameter estimates.\n(4) Annotation.\nTo further optimize costs, we cleared the previous question-answering cache con -\ntext before the annotation phase and utilized separate tool models for specific \ntasks where extensive context was unnecessary. Initial annotation uses the top \n10 highly variable genes for each cluster, identified through Wilcoxon rank-sum \ntests. This strategy has been shown to yield optimal performance [7 ]. scExtract \nintegrates this information with background knowledge to annotate cell clusters. \nAnnotations include cell type, confidence level, sample tissue origin, disease state, \nand developmental stage. It should be noted that these annotations carry inher -\nent variability due to LLM outputs and should be interpreted with appropriate \ncaution.\n(5) Re-annotation (optional).\nIn this step, scExtract allows the language model to select genes for querying, poten -\nPage 22 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \ntially improving annotations. As language models are not sensitive to numerical \ninferences, cluster-level expression data is first summarized into natural language \nby a tool model before being input into scExtract for judgment and re-annotation.\nOutput and documentation\nIn addition to the processed dataset, scExtract generates a config file documenting all \nprocessing parameters and a log file detailing the reasoning behind parameter choices \nand annotations at each step (Fig.  1B). For multi-dataset annotations, cross-dataset \ncorrection is recommended. For single dataset annotations, users should carefully \nreview the log file contents.\nCellxgene benchmark dataset preparation\nTo evaluate scExtract’s performance, we utilized manually processed datasets from \ncellxgene. Eighteen datasets were selected (Additional file 2: Table S1), balancing ran -\ndom selection with sample diversity. We prioritized datasets containing fewer than \n50,000 cells per individual set, as larger datasets often comprise multiple sub-datasets \nwith more chance to be uploaded to public cohorts, diminishing the need for auto -\nmatic annotation. We downloaded the original matrix data uploaded by study authors \nand aligned them with cellxgene’s processed data using cell barcodes. During this \nprocess, two datasets were excluded due to lack of original author-defined cell type \ncolumn, leaving six datasets for benchmarking.\nAutomatic annotation with established methods\nFor singleR, we used python implemented SingleR with “HumanPrimaryCellAtlas” \nas the reference dataset for label transfer annotation. This choice prioritizes method \ngeneralizability over optimizing SingleR’s performance with specialized datasets, \naligning with our focus on automated processing. We employed CellTypist v1.6.3 [30] \nfor our analysis. As CellTypist does not provide cross-tissue reference data, we uti -\nlized LLMs to automatically extract tissue types from datasets and performed label \ntransfer using corresponding reference data. Moreover, it is important to note that \nthe fundamental limitation in label transfer algorithm, the inability to identify and \nannotate novel cell types, persists regardless of the reference dataset used. We applied \nthe same approach to scType; however, due to scType’s limited tissue type coverage, it \nsuccessfully annotated fewer samples compared to the aforementioned methods.\nBenchmark cellxgene dataset annotation accuracy\nConsistent with our use of LLMs, we adopted a text-to-embedding approach, with \nconfigurable models specified in the scExtract config file. Ontology-based method is \nalso supported in scExtract.benchmark function setting method parameter to “ols_\napi” . However, this method is constrained by naming style limitations in its initial \nstring-matching step from custom annotation to cell ontology nodes trough Ontol -\nogy Lookup Service. While the original version [7 ] used a binary scoring system (1 \nfor exact matches, 0.5 for shared parent classes), we implemented a more nuanced \nPage 23 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \napproach. We calculate the Jaccard coefficient using all hierarchical nodes in the cell \nclassification tree, resulting in a more universally applicable and granular evaluation. \nThe primary challenge with the text-to-embedding method lies in its training on gen -\neral models, where cell type semantics may be influenced by other linguistic contexts \n(Additional file 1: Fig. S2D). We anticipate that a future fine-tuned model could better \ndifferentiate the biological significance of cell types, potentially improving the accu -\nracy of automated annotations.\nPrompt variation designs\nTo explore how different prompts influence task performance, we developed five vari -\nants of our original prompt, including Instruction_Reordering, which simply rear -\nranged the narrative sequence; Terminology_Modification, which replaced terms \nwith synonyms; Enhanced_Guidance, which incorporated more detailed descrip -\ntions and instructions; Minimalistic_Annotation, which used the minimal possible \ninstructional content; and Structural_Reformatting, which employed JSON format \nfor output, while other prompts utilized YAML-like format. The contents of prompts \nvariants can be inspected at the github repository for reproduction (https:// github.  \ncom/ yxwucq/ scExt ract_ repro duce/ blob/ master/ scrip ts_ revis ion/ prompt_ varia tion. \npy). We evaluated the impact of different prompts on both preprocessing and annota -\ntion stages separately, creating five variants each for the filter parameter extraction \nand annotation prompts, and repeated the evaluations for three times on Sample 11 \nto assess the performance of different prompt configurations.\nScanorama‑prior integration methods with prior knowledge\nWe utilize cell type similarity matrices as previously mentioned to introduce prior infor-\nmation on cell cluster similarities. In the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) construction \nprocess, cell distance matrices are weighted by naming similarities:\nwhere d′ij , dij , and MIJ  are modified distance between cell i and cell j, raw distance \nbetween cell i and cell j, cell type similarity between cell type I and cell type J. The gen-\neral-used text to embedding model’s cell naming distances are typically more than 0.3, \nallowing for meaningful differentiation without introducing extreme outliers. In faster \nkNN graph construction methods using annoy index, scanorama-prior first expands \nthe candidate cell pool to five times (configurable) the size of k. It then performs \nweighted distance calculations within this expanded candidate list to select the k nearest \nneighbors.\nDuring the distance reduction process, cells lacking adjacency relationships with the \ntarget dataset’s cells are shifted closer to expression-similar cells within the same group, \nminimizing interference from other group displacement vectors. Additionally, a cluster \ncenter-based displacement vector is applied based on the annotation similarity between \ncells and their corresponding target dataset cells. This is represented as:\nd′ij = dij/M IJ\nBias′ij = Biasij + M IJ × (v i − v I − v j + v J )\nPage 24 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \nwhere Biasij , MIJ  , vi , vI , v j , vJ are original bias between cell i and j, cell type similarity \nbetween cell type I and cell type J, embedding vector of cell i, mean embedding vector \nof cell type I, embedding vector of target cell j, embedding vector of target cell type J. \nConsequently, higher annotation consistency results in new embeddings being shifted to \nmaintain relative positions within the new cluster, enhancing integration.\nCellhint‑prior harmonization methods with prior knowledge\nWe utilize cell type similarity matrices to incorporate prior information on cell clus -\nter similarities. The integration process begins by calculating the raw distance matrix \nbetween cells and cell types. The raw distance matrix is then normalized by dividing it \nby the mean distance across all cell pairs and converted into a similarity matrix using \nnegated exponential transformation. When embedding dictionaries are provided, a prior \nsimilarity matrix is computed using cell type embeddings. The raw distance matrix is \nthen normalized to a similarity matrix:\nwhere S′ij , β , αi,Sij , and MIJ  are adjusted similarity of cell i and target cell type J, hyper \nparameter for the effect of prior information (default set to 0.1), inversion of clarity score \nwhich is calculated based on the entropy of cell i to all cell types, raw similarity of cell i \nand target cell type J, and cell type similarity between cell type I and cell type J. The clar -\nity score, which quantifies the distinctiveness of a cell’s expression profile, serves as a \nmodulator in this process. When the clarity score decreases, indicating difficulty in dis -\ntinguishing cell types based solely on expression data, the influence of prior knowledge \nbecomes more pronounced. Conversely, for cells with high clarity scores, the algorithm \nrelies more heavily on the expression-based similarities.\nPancreas dataset benchmark\nFor the pancreas dataset benchmark, we evaluated scanorama and scanorama_prior \nusing identical parameters. Log1p-transformed data with highly variable genes were \nused as model inputs. Integration was performed using the integrate_scanpy function of \nboth methods, with approx = False and knn = 30. For evaluation, neighborhood graphs \nwere generated for both embeddings using n_neighbors = 30, and UMAP embeddings \nwere created with default parameters. All embeddings were evaluated using single-cell \nbenchmarking metrics provided by scib_metrics [6]. For cellhint and cellhint_prior, we \napplied consistent default parameters as recommended by the original methods [9], \nusing 50-dimensional PCA embeddings as input without the PCT method. Cell type \nembeddings were generated using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large model accessed \nthrough Azure API.\nLabel change experiment\nFor label change experiments, we manually modified specific cell types in selected data -\nsets and evaluated using the aforementioned integration methods. We conducted five \nbatch experiments, each incorporating three types of modifications described in the \npaper: Fuzzy match, Unbiased error, and Biased error. Integration methods remained \nS′iJ = β[(1− α i)SiJ + α iM IJ ]+ (1− β)SiJ\nPage 25 of 28\nWu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n \nconsistent with above. To minimize background interference, we isolated cells with \nmodified labels for subsequent evaluation. Integration metrics were calculated using \nilhouette_score, adjusted_rand_score, and normalized_mutual_info_score function \nfrom sklearn.metrics module. Additionally, we performed unsupervised clustering using \nLeiden algorithm (resolution = 0.7) and applied major voting to the modified cell types \nto generate consensus cell type annotations. The results were analyzed using confusion \nmatrices.\nTime consumption across diverse methods\nWe conducted a comprehensive evaluation of runtime performance on both a PC and \na GPU-accelerated server. The PC was equipped with an Intel Core i5-13600 K proces -\nsor, while the server used Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6132 CPU @ 2.60 GHz with an Nvidia \nTesla V100-PCIE-32 GB GPU. To generate a large-scale dataset, we utilized the pancreas \ndataset and employed a replication-based approach. Specifically, the original dataset \nwas replicated three times, with each copy assigned a unique index to serve as the initial \ninput for concatenation. This input was then progressively concatenated to simulate data \nscales ranging from 1 × to approximately 20x (equivalent to 1 million cells).\nEach method was systematically integrated using the aforementioned approach, \nwith the focus solely on the time required for the integration process. Specifically, we \nbenchmarked the runtime of cellhint.harmonize, scanorama.integrate_scanpy, and \ntheir respective prior-incorporated variants. On the GPU-enabled server, we activated \nGPU acceleration by setting use_gpu = True, leveraging CuPy for enhanced computa -\ntional efficiency. To mitigate the risk of memory overflow, we configured the batch_size \nparameter for the scanorama-related methods to 1000 cells.\nLarge‑scale dataset benchmark\nThe integration and benchmarking methodologies employed were consistent with those \npreviously described. Notably, within the Human Oral Cell Atlas dataset, we excluded a \ndataset labeled as “multiple” due to the inability to accurately assess its independence. \nNo modifications were made to the remaining datasets.\nAutomatic integration of 14 skin datasets\nWe initially selected 20 datasets for our integration study. One dataset was excluded due \nto its murine origin, and another for being a duplicate. Two datasets were omitted owing \nto missing matrix files. A dataset with atlas-level cell numbers was reserved for subse -\nquent assessment of result reproducibility. Another dataset was excluded due to insuf -\nficient cell count. This curation process yielded 14 datasets suitable for integration. To \nmaintain data diversity while managing computational load, datasets exceeding 60,000 \ncells were randomly downsampled to this threshold.\nThe integration process followed a standardized three-step protocol: initial automatic \nannotation using scExtract, followed by cell type harmonization via cellhint-prior, and \nfinished in embedding integration using scanorama-prior. For the integrated dataset, we \napplied X_scanorama_prior with the parameter n_neighbors = 30 to compute the neigh-\nbors’ graph. Subsequently, we employed the Leiden clustering algorithm with resolution \nPage 26 of 28Wu and Tang  Genome Biology          (2025) 26:174 \n= 0.5 to partition the cells into distinct clusters. To further refine the annotation, we \nutilized the major_vote_top_clusters function provided by scExtract, which performs a \nconsensus-based voting mechanism across individual dataset annotations to assign con -\nsistent cell type labels.\nSubcluster analysis and pseudo‑bulk generation\nFor the subpopulation analysis of T cells and keratinocytes, we extracted the corre -\nsponding subsets from the large-scale integrated dataset. Given the reduced number of \ncells in these subsets, we adjusted the parameter n_neighbors to 15 to optimize the anal-\nysis. Using the top 30 principal components (PCs), we reconstructed the neighborhood \ngraph and UMAP embeddings with both X_scanorama_prior and X_scanorama.\nTo mitigate the impact of batch differences between single cells on differential gene \nexpression, we constructed pseudo-bulk samples using decoupleR v1.6.0 [62]. This \napproach helps to reduce the influence of technical variations between batches and \nprovides a more robust foundation for identifying biologically relevant gene expression \ndifferences.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13059- 025- 03639-x.\nAdditional file 1.
