    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots utilizing large language models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant interest due to their ability to generate humanlike responses to user inquiries in an interactive dialog format. While these models are being increasingly utilized to obtain medical information by patients, scientific and medical providers, and trainees to address biomedical questions, their performance may vary from field to field. The opportunities and risks these chatbots pose to the widespread understanding of skeletal health and science are unknown. Here we assess the performance of 3 high-profile LLM chatbots, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) 4.0, BingAI, and Bard, to address 30 questions in 3 categories: basic and translational skeletal biology, clinical practitioner management of skeletal disorders, and patient queries to assess the accuracy and quality of the responses. Thirty questions in each of these categories were posed, and responses were independently graded for their degree of accuracy by four reviewers. While each of the chatbots was often able to provide relevant information about skeletal disorders, the quality and relevance of these responses varied widely, and ChatGPT 4.0 had the highest overall median score in each of the categories. Each of these chatbots displayed distinct limitations that included inconsistent, incomplete, or irrelevant responses, inappropriate utilization of lay sources in a professional context, a failure to take patient demographics or clinical context into account when providing recommendations, and an inability to consistently identify areas of uncertainty in the relevant literature. Careful consideration of both the opportunities and risks of current AI chatbots is needed to formulate guidelines for best practices for their use as source of information about skeletal health and biology.",
