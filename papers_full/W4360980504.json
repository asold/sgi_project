A range of fabrication methods exist \nto manufacture nanoscale features for applications in sen-\nsors and nanoelectromechanical systems for example [ 1]. \nCurrently, adopted methods to produce nanoscale struc-\ntures and patterned devices include deep and extreme \nultraviolet nanolithography, nanoimprint lithography, \nfocused ion beam machining, wet etching, electron \n * Emmanuel Brousseau \n brousseaue@cardiff.ac.uk\n1 School of Engineering, Cardiff University, \nCardiff CF24 3AA, UK\n2 School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University, \nCardiff CF24 3AA, UK\n3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, \nUniversity of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, \nCA 93106, USA\n Nanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5 \n1 3    5  Page 2 of 12\nbeam cutting, and single-point nanoscale machining. In \nthe context of prototype device development, most of \nthese techniques can be limited by the choice of sub-\nstrate materials or the cost of equipment and processing. \nAtomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nano-scratching \nmay provide a cost-effective alternative to create fea-\ntures, such as nano-grooves with high levels of lateral \nand vertical resolutions [ 2–4]. Nanoindenter systems also \nfall into this category of enabling equipment, as they \ncan be used to implement a similar mechanism to gener -\nate nanoscale grooves on various materials[5 ], with the \nadded benefit of not being affected by the compliance \nof AFM cantilever probes [6 , 7]. The development of \ndifferent tool tip geometries, such as spherical tips [8 ], \nconical tips [ 9], and pyramidal tips [10], has enabled the \nproduction of various nanochannel shapes. A common \ncharacteristic of mechanical material removal at such a \nsmall scale is that the rake angle of a typical tool is often \nnegative due to its inherent geometry and cutting edge \nradius. The resulting topography of nanoscale grooves is \nnot only evidently influenced by the tool geometry but it \nalso depends on the properties of the processed material \nand the specific removal mechanism at play, i.e., plough-\ning and/or cutting. For this reason, it is often desirable \nto model the nanoscale scratching process as a function \nof processing parameters, such as the rake angle of the \ntool. Such simulations can be useful not only to predict \nthe scratched topography but also to understand how the \nprocess affects subsurface material properties, such as \nthe extent of plastic strain underneath a groove.\nThe nanoscale scratching process is often modeled \nusing molecular dynamics [11– 19]. However, given that \nthis approach is typically restricted to very small spatial \nand time scales, on the order of nanometers (nm) and \nnanoseconds (ns), its application can be limited when one \nneeds to simulate more realistic length and time condi-\ntions. Based on continuum mechanics, smooth particle \nhydrodynamics (SPH) has recently emerged as a modeling \ntechnique to investigate the nanoscale scratching process. \nThe SPH approach, initially developed by Gingold and \nMonaghan [20] and Lucy [21] for applications in astron-\nomy, is a meshless numerical method that discretizes the \nproblem domain with SPH particles and thus eliminates \nthe issues related to mesh distortion experienced by tra-\nditional continuum mesh-based methodologies, such as \nfinite element method, finite-volume method, and bound-\nary element method [22]. With the successful develop-\nment of the SPH method in handling large deformations \nin solid and fluid mechanics problems, its application has \nbeen extended to micro and nano machining in recent \nyears [23]. For example, Leroch et al. [24] implemented \na mesh-free total Lagrangian SPH algorithm using \nLAMMPS to simulate scratching on a viscoplastic mate-\nrial. While these authors found that the tangential forces \nobserved in the simulations were lower than those meas-\nured in experimental trials, they found that the simulated \nscratch hardness still compared well with the experimental \nresults. Guo et al. [25] performed SPH simulations using \nLS-DYNA of nanochannel scratching with two different \nindenter configurations, which included a spherical capped \nconical tip and a spherical capped regular three-side pyra -\nmid tip. These authors performed scratching along differ -\nent directions on the workpiece, and their investigation \nshowed that the magnitude of the normal forces, in the \ncase of a pyramidal tip, vary significantly along differ -\nent directions of scratching. Islam et al. [26] performed \nan SPH-based modeling study of nanoscale scratching \nwith an elastoplastic material model. They also observed \nthat the simulated normal forces were greater than the \nsimulated cutting forces and that a higher negative rake \nangle led to a reduction in ploughing and an increase in \nthe residual stress and strain.\nA considerable amount of research has been published \nusing modeling and experimental techniques to investi-\ngate the nanoscale scratching process. For atomic-scale \nmodeling techniques, the length scale in simulations is \nnot similar to that of experiments, and the mesh-based \ncontinuum-scale modeling techniques suffer from the \nmesh distortion problem. Moreover, it is very difficult to \nanalyze subsurface deformation underneath grooves and \nunderlying material removal, and deformation mecha-\nnisms with the available experimental characterization \ntechniques. The particle-based SPH method is a robust \nmodeling technique that eliminates the mesh distortion \nproblem and can simulate the process in a similar length \nscale to experiments. In the research presented here, an \nin-house Lagrangian SPH code was developed to model \nthe nanoscale scratching process and to investigate the \neffects of the scratching depth and tool rake angle on the \nresulting forces, groove topography, and the extent of the \ndeformed layer under a groove as a function of the rake \nangle. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \nThe nanoscale scratching model configuration and mate-\nrial properties of the tool and workpiece are described \nin Sect.  2. The computational procedure developed by \ndetailing the governing equations, SPH discretization, \nand contact model adopted in the numerical simulations \nis explained in Sect.  3. The model validation and effect \nof scratching parameters on the groove formation, forces, \nand residual plastic deformed layer are discussed in detail \nin Sect.  4. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in \nSect. 5.\nNanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5  \n1 3 Page 3 of 12     5 \n2  Materials and Nanoscale Scratching \nModel\nA 3D configuration of the nano-scratching process and its \n2D schematic representation illustrating the tool and work -\npiece are shown in Fig.  1. The modeled tool was conical \nand had a spherical cap with a specified radius at the tip. \nAs illustrated in Fig.  1b, for the purpose of the numerical \nsimulation, the bottom and front ends of the workpiece \nwere treated as fixed boundaries to provide a rigid base. \nThe spherical capped conical tool had a radius (R0) and con-\nsisted of a rake angle (γ), as shown by the schematic diagram \nin Fig. 2. The tool tip was made of diamond, and its density, \nelastic modulus, and Poisson ratio were 3520 kg/m 3, 1150 \nGPa, and 0.07, respectively. The tool was assumed to be \nrigid. The workpiece material was chosen as oxygen-free \nhigh-conductivity (OFHC) copper in the present work. The \nOFHC Cu has an elastic modulus of 124 GPa, a shear modu-\nlus of 46.3 GPa, a yield stress of 0.4 GPa, and a Poisson’s \nratio of 0.34 [27]. As stated earlier, the workpiece material \nwas described by an elastoplastic constitutive model.\nThe nanoscale scratching simulations were performed \nusing a tool tip with a radius of 100 nm. Three different \nscratching depths, i.e., 100, 150, and 200 nm, were con-\nsidered in this work to analyze the effect of the depth of \ncut on the deformation and scratched surface of the Cu \nworkpiece material. Three different negative rake angles \n(i.e., 10°, 30°, and 60°) were also selected to determine \nthe effect of various values of the negative rake angle on \nmachined surfaces. In the presented simulations, the tool \nwas initially indented into the copper workpiece up to a \ncertain depth, and subsequently, it was moved parallel to \nthe top surface at the same depth to produce a nanoscale \nscratch. For validating the developed code, experimental \nresults available in the literature [26] for 100-, 150-, and \n200-nm scratching depths with a 60° negative rake angle \ntool were compared with the outcome of the numerical \nsimulations.\n3  Computational Procedure\nThe computational approach used was based on the SPH \nmethod. SPH is a particle-based Lagrangian modeling tech-\nnique where a continuum domain is represented by a set of \nparticles. In a Lagrangian-based approach, field variables, such \nas density, pressure, and velocity can be traced at SPH parti-\ncles, which follow the material deformation. A smoothing or \nkernel function is utilized in the SPH formulations to obtain \nthe approximate field properties. For any particle, the approxi-\nmated field variables or properties are determined by taking an \naverage over neighboring particles using smoothing functions.\n3.1  Governing Equations\nIn the Lagrangian approach, to solve governing conservation \nequations, the reference or undeformed configuration of the \nsimulation domain remains fixed as the simulation progresses. \nThe current or deformed configuration is computed with respect \nto the reference configuration. Therefore, the conservation and \nconstitutive equations are expressed in terms of the coordinates \nof the reference configuration X. A mapping function ϕ relates \nthe reference and current configuration and is used to define the \nbody motion between two configurations at a given time t as\nwhere x represents the current configuration coordinates \nand X represents the corresponding reference configuration \ncoordinates. Hence, displacement is given by\n(1)x = /u1D719(X, t)\n(2)u = x − X\nFig. 1  a 3D model of nano-\nscratching and b 2D schematic \nview\nFig. 2  Schematic diagram of the spherical capped conical tip model\n Nanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5 \n1 3    5  Page 4 of 12\nThe deformation gradient represents the gradient of the map-\nping function:\nThe conservation equations for mass and momentum in the \nLagrangian approach are represented by\nwhere ρ is the mass density, σ is the stress tensor, v denotes \nthe velocity, and ∇ is the gradient operator. For elastic sol-\nids, the stress tensor can be expressed as a composition of \nvolumetric and deviatoric parts:\nwhere p is the mean stress or pressure and σ′ denotes devia-\ntoric stress.\n3.2  SPH Discretization\nThe nanoscale scratching model comprising of a tool and a \nworkpiece was discretized with SPH particles [28], as shown \nin Fig. 3. SPH is a two-step approximation method: The first \nstep is particle approximation, where a continuum is repre-\nsented by clouds of particles. The second step is smoothing, \nwhich indicates that any property of the particle is approxi-\nmated as the weighted average of values associated with \nsurrounding particles. The SPH particles interact through \na kernel function.\nMathematically, a given function f(x) can be approximated, \nin a discretized form, by the values associated with neighbor-\ning particles and a kernel function W(x, h) [29] as follows:\nwhere h is the smoothing length and Vb is the volume associ-\nated with particle b. The kernel function should fulfill the \nfollowing consistency conditions for accurately reproducing \nthe given function f(x):\nwhere δ denotes the Dirac delta function. The SPH interpo-\nlation of the first derivative of the function f(x) in a discre-\ntized domain can be expressed as:\n(3)F = dx\ndX\n(4)d/u1D70C\ndt =− /u1D70C∇⋅ /u1D42F\n(5)d/u1D42F\ndt = 1\n/u1D70C∇ ⋅ /u1D748\n(6)/u1D748=− pI + /u1D748�\n(7)f(x) =\nM/uni2211.s1\nb=1\nfbW b\n/parenleft.s1x − xb,hb\n/parenright.s1Vb\n(8)/uni222B.smW (x,h)dx = 1\n(9)lim\nh→0\nW (x,h) → /u1D6FF(x)\nThe SPH method uses smoothing or the kernel function for \ninterpolating the properties of a given particle from neigh-\nboring particles and is governed by a radius of influence, i.e., \nthe smoothing length h. Various smoothing kernel functions \nexist for implementing numerical approximations. The quan-\ntic spline kernel is one of the most popular functions used, \nand it is defined as follows:\nwhere q = /uni007C.varx/uni007C.var\nh  and α  denotes the normalizing factor of the \nquintic spline kernel function. For the above kernel function, \nα is determined as\nThe velocities and positions of the SPH particles are updated \nby the leapfrog time integration scheme, which can be \nexpressed as\nwhere /u1D42Fn+1\n2\n,/u1D42Fn−1\n2\n are the velocities of SPH particles at the \nnext and previous half steps, respectively.

The pres-\nsure distribution at the contact is semi-elliptical, and the \ninterface between the two particles is circular with the \npeak pressure taking place at the center. The magnitude \nof the interaction force (F ) between the tool and work -\npiece SPH particles is defined based on the Hertz contact \nmodel as\nwhere the contact modulus E* is expressed as\nIn the above equation, Ei and Ej are the respective elastic \nmodulus of the tool and workpiece.

Following the validation \nof the model, the scratched surface was further analyzed to \nunderstand the cutting and ploughing mechanisms for dif-\nferent scratching depths and rake angles. In the experimental \ninvestigation employed as a reference [26], the scratching \nspeed was not mentioned. The speed used in the current \nsimulation study was 100 m/s, which is higher than that \nemployed in actual nano-scratching experiments. Initially, \nsimulation trials were carried out with different scratch-\ning speeds. However, it was observed that the value of the \nscratching speed had little effect on the simulation outcomes, \ni.e., forces and produced topography. For this reason, the \nhigher speed of 100 m/s was eventually used to save compu-\ntational time. In the simulation study on nano-scratching car-\nried out by Guo et al. [25], the magnitude of the scratching \nspeed did not have a significant effect either on the normal \nand cutting forces.\n4.1  Model Validation: Contact Forces\nThe normal and cutting forces obtained from the simulations \nwere compared with the available experimental results from \nthe work of Islam et al. [26]. For a fixed negative rake angle \nof 60°, the simulated and experimental results of normal \nand cutting forces for different scratching depth values of \n100, 150, and 200 nm are presented in Figs.  5, 6, and 7, \nrespectively. The overall evolution of the forces is similar \nfor all scratching depths. In particular, when the scratching \ninitiates, the normal force undergoes a drop in magnitude for \nall three cutting depths considered here. This is due to the \nfact that the tool is in contact with neighboring workpiece \nFig. 5  Variation of forces for the 100-nm scratching depth with a 60° \nnegative rake angle tool\nFig. 6  Variation of forces for the 150-nm scratching depth with a 60° \nnegative rake angle tool\nFig. 7  Variation of forces for the 200-nm scratching depth with a 60° \nnegative rake angle tool\nFig. 8  Variation of simulated average forces against the scratching \ndepth for a 60° negative rake angle tool\nNanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5  \n1 3 Page 7 of 12     5 \nparticles in all radial directions during the initial indentation \nprocess, and as the scratching process subsequently starts, \nthe tool does not remain in contact with the particles behind \nthe scratching direction. Thus, the normal force experienced \nby the tool is decreased as the number of particles in contact \nwith the tool rapidly reduces. This drop in normal force is \nobserved to be higher in the case of the simulation results. \nOne of the reasons for such a large drop in the simulated \nnormal force may be attributed to the fact that a high scratch-\ning speed used in simulations causes the tool and workpiece \nmaterial behind the tool to lose contact rapidly as the effect \nof elastic recovery may not play a role in this case. Follow-\ning the initial drop in magnitude, the normal force rapidly \nincreases for a short period and subsequently fluctuates \naround a particular value. Moreover, the simulated values \nobtained for cutting and normal forces are consistently lower \nthan the experimental ones for all scratching depths. This \nobservation is summarized in Fig.  8 and is consistent with \nthe observations reported by Leroch et al. [24]. In the case \nof the normal force, the difference between simulated results \nand experimental ones becomes more pronounced as the \nscratching depth decreases from 200 to 100 nm, whereas the \nopposite is observed for the cutting force. A likely explana-\ntion for this general discrepancy may be attributed to the \nfact that the material constitutive model used here does not \ntake into account the well-known indentation size effect [30, \n31], which was also shown to be existing when nanoscale \nscratching is considered [32, 33]. The other contributing \nFig. 9  Simulated groove topography and its cross-sectional view for a 60° negative rake angle tool with different scratching depth values: a 100 \nnm, b 150 nm, and c 200 nm\n Nanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5 \n1 3    5  Page 8 of 12\nfactor to the difference between the simulation and experi-\nmental forces may also be the slight deviation in the tool \ngeometry and workpiece surface used between the simula-\ntions and experiments. As suggested by Islam et al. [26], \nthe tool and workpiece are usually not perfectly smooth in \nthe experiments. In spite of these discrepancies, which will \nrequire further refinement of the material constitutive equa-\ntions in future works, the model was subsequently used to \ngain some insights into the resulting groove topography, as \npresented in the following subsection.\n4.2  Groove Formation\nFigure 9 presents contour plots illustrating the pile-up height \nand corresponding groove cross-sectional view at its mid-\nsection obtained during the nanoscale scratching simula-\ntion of the Cu specimen for the three depths considered. As \nexpected, with the increase in the depth, the pile-up height \nincreases, and so does the width of the groove. It is known \nthat when the depth of cut reaches the minimum chip thick-\nness values for a given combination of material and cut-\nting edge radius, then a transition between ploughing and \ncutting occurs, with material being removed essentially as \na chip [34]. Consequently, if the given scratching depth is \nless than the minimum chip thickness, the material from the \nworkpiece will not be removed as a chip, and the dominant \nmechanism could be ploughing or sliding. In the reported \nsimulation, the material is mainly ploughed and accumulated \non the sides of the groove along the scratching length which \nsuggests that the scratching depth is below the minimum \nchip thickness.\nFurthermore, in Fig. 9, the topography of the groove var-\nies along the scratching direction on the workpiece. The \nexperimental observations in [5 ] also reported the non-\nuniformity of the groove dimensions along the scratch. \nTherefore, to validate the simulated groove profile against \nthe experimental results, the simulated groove profiles were \nextracted at five different cross sections along the scratch, \nas indicated in Fig.  10a. These cross sections were at dis-\ntances of 500, 750, 1000, 1300, and 1600 nm from the point \nwhere the scratching was initiated. The extracted profiles \nfrom the five cross sections were used to produce an aver -\nage cross-sectional profile for the 150 nm scratching depth, \nwhich was then compared against available experimental \nresults from Islam and Ibrahim [ 35]. Figure  10b displays \nthis comparison, where the height and depth of the simulated \nand experimental groove profiles agree well. The approxi-\nmate width and height of the simulated groove profile were \n946 and 192 nm, respectively, whereas the corresponding \nexperimental groove profile values are 1.1 μm and 205 nm, \nrespectively.\n4.3  Effect of the Tool Rake Angle on Contact Forces\nNext, the influence of the rake angle value of the simulated \nforces was analyzed. In particular, Fig. 11a, b show the vari-\nation of the cutting and normal forces for a 30° negative rake \nangle tool. Contrary to the results obtained when scratch-\ning with a 60° negative rake angle tool, the cutting forces \nobserved here were slightly higher than the simulated nor -\nmal forces for the two scratching depths of 150 and 200 nm. \nFor the 100 nm scratching depth, the normal force was still \nslightly higher than the cutting force. Figure 11c displays the \ndifference between the average cutting and normal force at \ndifferent scratching depths for the 30° negative rake angle \ntool. The comparison of Figs.  8 and 11c clearly noted that \nthe rake angle has an influence on the cutting and normal \nforces. In the case of scratching with a 30° negative rake \nangle tool, the cutting force at higher scratching depths was \ncomparable to or slightly higher than the normal forces. In \ngeneral, the cutting force becomes comparable to the normal \nforce when the scratching depth reaches the minimum chip \nthickness. This indicates that in the case of the 30° negative \nrake angle tool, the scratching depth is likely to have reached \nthe minimum chip thickness at depths around 150 nm to \n200 nm.\nTo investigate further the influence of the tool rake angle \non contact forces, simulations were also repeated for a tool \nwith a 10° negative rake angle. Figure 12 illustrates the aver-\nage cutting and normal forces obtained in this case. This fig-\nure shows a similar trend as in the case of nanoscale scratch-\ning with a 30° negative rake angle. However, the difference \nFig. 10  a Locations of the \nsampled groove profile and b \ncomparison of the groove cross-\nsectional profiles\n\nNanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5  \n1 3 Page 9 of 12     5 \nbetween the magnitudes of the cutting and normal forces is \nlarger at increased scratching depths. This suggests that the \ntransition from ploughing took place earlier with increas-\ning scratching depth and that cutting likely becomes the \ndominant mechanism of material removal at larger depths. \nBased on these observations, it can be summarized that for \na conical tool with 30° and 10° negative rake angles, the \nmechanism behind nanoscale scratching is either ploughing \ndominated or cutting dominated depending on the scratching \ndepth and that when the rake angle becomes less negative, \nthe transition from a ploughing-dominated to a cutting-dom-\ninated regime occurs at a reduced scratching depth.\n4.4  Assessment of the Residual Strain Underneath \na Scratched Groove\nIn this section, the effect of the scratching depth on the \nextent of the residual plastic strain is evaluated. Figure 13a–c \ndisplay the equivalent plastic strain distribution at a mid-\nsection of the scratch length obtained from the nanoscale \nscratching simulations for different depths of cut. According \nto Kermouche et al. [36], immediately underneath a single \nscratch, a small region of tensile stress should be present to \na maximum depth of about 0.5 times the contact radius, fol-\nlowed by a larger region of compressive stress with a thick-\nness of up to 2 to 3 times the contact radius. As a result, the \nsurface of a groove is irregular, and the groove’s intended \ndimensions might vary. The deformed subsurface layers also \ninfluence the surface roughness, which in turn affects the \nmechanical characteristics of the workpiece. Thus, the depth \nof the subsurface deformed layer is an important parameter, \nwhich can be difficult to be assessed experimentally [37]. \nFollowing scratching, this layer can have an effect on the \nmechanical properties and life of the scratched component. \nIn this study, the subsurface deformed layer was estimated \nusing the equivalent plastic strain distribution below the \nscratched surface, as reported in Fig.  13. It is noticed that \nthe subsurface deformed layer thickness increases with the \nincrease in the scratching depth. In particular, the thickness \nof this layer for a 60° negative rake angle tool doubles from \n190 nm at a 100 nm scratching depth to 375 nm at twice the \nscratching depth, i.e., 200 nm. Figure  14 summarizes the \ndeformed layer thicknesses for a surface scratched on the \nnanoscale using 10°, 30°, and 60° negative rake angle tools. \nThis bar chart shows that the more negative the rake angle, \nthe larger the thickness of the deformed layer. This phenom-\nenon was also observed in a conventional machining study \nbased on different tool rake angles carried out by Dahlman \net al. [38], where larger negative rake angle tools would lead \nto higher compressive stresses and a deeper deformed zone \nbelow the machined surface. Figure 14 also shows that for all \nrake angle values, the higher the scratching depth, the larger \nthe deformed layer thickness.\nFig. 11  Simulated contact \nforces for the 30° negative rake \nangle tool: a cutting force; b \nnormal force; c average forces\n\n Nanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5 \n1 3    5  Page 10 of 12\nThe present study involving the SPH modeling of \nnanoscale scratching could be expanded to other nanoscale \nmachining processes, such as single-point diamond turn-\ning, precision grinding, mechanical polishing, and lapping \nprocesses. These processes also make use of either a solid \nmechanical tool or loose abrasives to machine material \nfrom a workpiece. The underlying mechanisms of mate-\nrial removal and deformation in these processes bear some \nsimilarities to that of nanoscale scratching. For this reason, \na model similar to that used in this study could be helpful \nin investigating such nanoscale machining processes.\n5  Conclusions\nIn this study, the SPH method was employed for modeling \nthe nanoscale scratching process on copper using negative \nrake angle tools. Three scratching depths, i.e., 100, 150, \nand 200 nm, and three different negative rake angle values, \ni.e., 10°, 30°, and 60°, were considered for the simula -\ntion. The output of the simulations focused on analyz-\ning the tool–workpiece contact forces, scratched surface \ntopography, and residual stresses underneath a scratched \ngroove. The SPH simulation results were also compared \nwith experimental data from the literature. The following \nconclusions can be drawn from the reported results:\n1. The normal and cutting forces on the tool increase with \nan increase in the scratching depth. The tool rake angle \nalso significantly influences the contact forces in the \nnanoscale scratching process. More negative rake angle \nvalues lead to higher cutting and normal forces for all \nscratching depths considered. For less negative rake \nangle values, the cutting forces eventually become larger \nthan the normal force for increased scratching depths.\n2. The averaged simulated groove profile is in close agree-\nment with the experimental groove profile. In particular, \nFig. 12  Average cutting and normal forces from the nano-scratching \nsimulation with the 10° negative rake angle tool\nFig. 13  Equivalent plastic strain \ndistribution in the scratched \nworkpiece for a 60° negative \nrake angle tool with different \nscratching depth values: a 100 \nnm, b 150 nm, and c 200 nm\n\nNanomanufacturing and Metrology             (2023) 6:5  \n1 3 Page 11 of 12     5 \nthe difference between the simulated and experimen-\ntally observed groove dimensions was less than 15%. \nHowever, this comparative study was possible only in \nthe case of the 60° negative rake angle tool, as similar \nexperimental results could not be found in the literature \nfor other values.\n3. Ploughing and cutting mechanisms were inferred based \non the analysis of the simulated forces when scratch-\ning was performed with conical tools. The ploughing \nmechanism was more dominant during the nanoscale \nscratching process conducted with the 60° negative rake \nangle tool. In the case of the 10° and 30° negative rake \nangle tools, the ploughing mechanism was marginally \ndominant at lower scratching depths, whereas the cutting \nmechanism was more dominant at higher depths.\n4. A layer of residual plastic strain could also be simulated \nbeneath a groove following the scratching process. It was \nobserved that the thickness of the plastically deformed \nregion increased not only for higher scratching depths \nbut also for more negative rake angle tools.\nAcknowledgements The reported research was funded by the Engi -\nneering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the \ngrant EP/T01489X/1.
