I NTRODUCTION\nSome of the essential parts of an electric distribution system\nare the transformers which are responsible for duties like\nvoltage transmission and isolation. Nevertheless, they are one\nof the heaviest and most expensive parts of low frequency\n(50Hz) distribution systems. Nowadays, EPTs are used instead\nof ordinary power transformers to fulﬁll voltage transmission\nand to deliver power to the power system by using power\nelectronic converters [1], [2].\nThe main advantage of an EPT is its ability to control the\nvoltage phase angle and amplitude in both the primary and\nsecondary sides, immediately, via power electronic converters\n[3].\nIt is known that saturation ﬂux density has a reverse relation\nwith frequency. Therefore, by using a high frequency link via\nan EPT, the bulky iron core and heavy copper windings in\ntransformers can be eliminated.\nIn addition to the mentioned duties, this type of transformer\nimproves various qualities of the power, including the voltage\nunbalances, voltage harmonics, voltage sags, voltage swells\nManuscript received Apr. 20, 2011; revised Nov. 19, 2011\nRecommended for publication by Associate Editor Jun-Keun Ji.† Corresponding Author: Hooshmand r@eng.ui.ac.ir\nTel: +98-311-7934073, Fax: +98-311-7933071, University of Isfahan∗Dept. of Electrical Eng., University of Isfahan, Iran∗∗Dept. of Electrical Eng., Najaf Abad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran\nand voltage ﬂuctuations in the distribution network, as well\nas the voltage control, power ﬂow control, static and dynamic\nstability improvements in the transmission network [4]–[8].\nEPTs have received a great deal of attention in recent years\nin both industry and scientiﬁc centers and many studies have\nbeen performed on their performance mechanism, structural\ndesign, parallel performance and control strategies [9]–[12].\nIn terms of the performance mechanism, ﬁrst an EPT is\nanalyzed as a single-phase structure with connected converters\nin series, and then the switching of the converter in four-\nsteps is dealt with [9]. The EPT structure is also considered\nin terms of structural design, and then an appropriate design\nfor the considered system is proposed, in order to achieve the\nsystem requirements [10], [11]. Also, the subject of parallel\nperformance is considered. The EPT performance is compared\nwith that of an ordinary power transformer and an appropriate\ncontrol strategy is used [12].\nBut the main application studies focus on EPT performance\nin distribution systems (DEPT). There are two main structures\nfor DEPT; one does not have a DC-link [8], [13] and the other\nhas a DC-link [7], [12]. Using a DC-link has advantages such\nas controllable voltage and current on both sides of the DEPT\nvia pulse width modulation (PWM) technology. By utilizing\nSMC, a new method is presented in this paper for improving\nthe DEPT dynamic behavior with a DC-link. This dynamic\n146 Journal of Power Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 2012\nimprovement is considered in terms of the following four\ncontrolling aims:\n1) Maintaining the input currents in a sinusoidal form and\nin phase with the input voltages having a unity power factor.\n2) Keeping the dc-link voltage within the reference amount.\n3) Maintaining the output voltages at ﬁxed amounts.\n4) Keeping the output voltages in sinusoidal and symmetri-\ncal forms.\nThe DC-link voltage in the input stage plays an important\nrole in achieving the four controlling aims. Therefore, in\nsection 2, a DEPT model with a 3-wire DC-link is considered.\nIn the third section, the control and proper performance of the\nDEPT are analyzed by designing a PI controller and a linear\nquadratic regulator (LQR), and then introducing sliding mode\ncontrol (SMC). In section 4, the method of using the proposed\nSMC in the DEPT is presented. The simulation results in\nthe ﬁfth section show the capability of the SMC method, in\ncomparison with the PI and LQR methods.\nII. DEPT M ODEL\nIn this section, the DEPT model is expressed in terms of\nthe DC-link existence. Fig. 1 shows a diagram for a DEPT\nbase with a DC-link, which includes two power electronic\nconverters in the primary and secondary side and a medium\nfrequency transformer (MFT).\nThe main task of a MFT is the isolation of the system\nprimary and secondary side. Since the size of a transformer has\ninverse relation with the frequency, a medium frequency trans-\nformer (with a frequency of 1kHz) is smaller than an ordinary\npower transformer (with a frequency of 50Hz). According to\nFig. 1, ﬁrst a sinusoidal input voltage with a frequency of 50Hz\nis converted into a medium frequency signal (1kHz) and then\nit is coupled magnetically towards the secondary side. In the\nsecondary side, the medium frequency signal is transformed\ninto a sinusoidal output voltage via a converter.\nFig. 2 shows a DEPT structure with a 3-wire DC-link.\nAs can be seen, this transformer is formed by three-stages\nthat include the input, isolation and output stages. The input\nstage is a three-phase PWM rectiﬁer that converts a three-\nphase sinusoidal input voltage into DC voltage. The isolation\nstage includes an H-bridge-1 converter, a medium frequency\ntransformer (MFT) and an H-bridge-2 converter. The obtained\nDC voltage from the input stage feeds the H-bridge-1 and is\nmodulated into a medium frequency square waveform. Then\nthe obtained square wave is delivered to the MFT and the\nrectiﬁer and converted into a DC voltage via the H-bridge-2.\nThere is a three-phase high frequency inverter in the output\nstage that transforms the obtained DC voltage of the isolation\nstage into a three-phase ac sinusoidal voltage.\nFig. 3 shows a simpliﬁed diagram of a DEPT. The transient\nstates of the H-bridge are so fast in this simpliﬁed diagram\nthat they can be neglected. Also, the leakage inductance of\nthe MFT is sufﬁciently small in the real condition that it can\nbe ignored.\nAccording to Fig. 2, the dynamic equations include:\n\n\n\nLdila(t)\ndt = usa(t)−ula(t)+ Rila(t)\nLdilb(t)\ndt = usb(t)−ulb(t)+ Rilb(t)\nLdilc(t)\ndt = usc(t)−ulc(t)+ Rilc(t)\n(1)\n\n\n\nCf\nduLa(t)\ndt = if a(t)−iLa(t)\nCf\nduLb(t)\ndt = if b(t)−iLb(t)\nCf\nduLc(t)\ndt = if c(t)−iLc(t)\n(2)\n\n\n\nLf\ndi f a(t)\ndt = uoa(t)\nk −uLa(t)\nLf\ndi f b(t)\ndt = uob(t)\nk −uLb(t)\nLf\ndi f c(t)\ndt = uoc(t)\nk −uLc(t)\n(3)\nd\ndt\n(1\n2Cu2\ndc\n)\n= ula(t)ila(t)+ ulb(t)ilb(t) +ulc(t)ilc(t)\n−uoa(t)if a(t)\nk −uob(t)if b(t)\nk −uoc(t)if c(t)\nk\n(4)\nwhere,\nC = C1 +C2\n/\nk2\nL,R : inductor and resistor of the input stage\nC1,C2 : dc capacitors of the input and output stages\nLf ,Cf : ﬁlter inductor and capacitor of the output stage\nk : transformation ratio of MFT\nUdc : DC-link voltage of the input stage\nc.b.a : denotes three-phase stationary reference frame\nus = [usa,usb,usc] : instantaneous input voltages\nuL = [uLa,uLb,uLc] : instantaneous output voltages\nul = [ula,ulb,ulc] : instantaneous ac terminal voltages of the\ninput stage\nuo = [uoa,uob,uoc] : instantaneous ac terminal voltages of\nthe output stage\nil = [ila,ilb,ilc] : input currents\nif = [if a,if b,if c] : ﬁlter inductance currents of the output\nstage\niL = [iLa,iLb,iLc] : load currents\nIn addition to these equations, the voltage variables regard-\ning equations (1) to (4) can be expressed with the following\nalgebraic equations:\n\n\n\nusa(t) =\n√\n2Us sinωt\nusb(t) =\n√\n2Us sin(ωt −2π\n3 )\nusc(t) =\n√\n2Us sin(ωt + 2π\n3 )\n(5)\n\n\n\nula(t) =m1Udc sin(ωt −θ1)\nulb(t) =m1Udc sin(ωt −θ1 −2π\n3 )\nulc(t) =m1Udc sin(ωt −θ1 + 2π\n3 )\n(6)\nImproving the Dynamic Performance of Distribution Electronic Power Transformers··· 147\nFig. 1.

DEPT C ONTROLLERS STRUCTURE\nTo achieve the aims mentioned in the introduction, the\ninput, isolation and the output stages should be controlled in a\nsuitable way. This section deals with designing the LQR and\nthe PI controllers and introducing the SMC. Also, separate\ncontrollers are considered for each of the three-stage of the PI\ncontrollers. However, the LQR and SMC, controllers are only\ndesigned for input and output stages.\nA. PI controller for a DEPT\nFor controlling a DEPT and for achieving a more appropri-\nate performance, the following controlling method, based on a\nPI controller for each of the input, isolation and output stages,\nis used [10].\n148 Journal of Power Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 2012\nFig. 4. Model of the input stage.\n1) Control method for the input stage:The input stage is\nconnected directly to the primary of the system. In order to\nprevent harmonic injection into the network, the input current\nshould be sinusoidal and in phase with the input voltage and\nthe power factor should equal to “1”. Thus, a controllable\ncurrent source for controlling the input stage is used.\nThe mathematical model of the input stage can be written\nin the a-b-c stationary reference frame or in the d-q rotating\nreference frame. However, using the controlling method in\nthe d-q frame results in better performance [14]. Hence, the\nmathematical model of the input stage in the d-q rotating\nreference frame can be used as follows:\n\n\n\nLdild\ndt = ωLilq −uld +usd\nLdilq\ndt = −ωLild −ulq +usq\n(12)\nwhere the existing variables in the equations include:\n[\nild ilq\n]T = K\n[\nila ilb ilc\n]T\n[\nuld ulq\n]T = K\n[\nula ulb ulc\n]T\n[\nusd usq\n]T = K\n[\nusa usb usc\n]T\nK = 2\n3\n[\nsinωt sin(ωt −120) sin(ωt +120)\ncosωt cos(ωt −120) cos(ωt +120)\n]\nω : synchronous angular velocity of the grid voltage\n[ild ,ilq] : input currents in the synchronous rotating frame\n[uld ,ulq] : terminal voltages of input stage in the syn-\nchronous rotating frame\n[usd,usq] : input voltages in the synchronous rotating frame\nK : Park’s transformation matrix\nil = [ila,ilb,ilc] : input currents in the stationary frame\nul = [ula,ulb,ulc] : terminal voltages of input stage in the\nstationary frame\nus = [usa,usb,usc] : input voltages in the stationary frame\nThis model is shown in Fig. 4.\nEquation (12) and Fig. 4 show that there is a relation\nbetween the “d” and “q” axes that could affect the dynamic\nperformance of the system. To solve this problem and separate\nthe d-q voltage, the components of the control input source\nvoltage are used as a “feed-forward”. To keep the dc voltage\nﬁxed and the input current sinusoidal, a double loop control\nis used, where one loop is a dc voltage output loop and the\nother is a current internal loop. This method is shown in Fig.\n5.\nThe starred variables in this ﬁgure indicate the reference\nvariables. As can be seen in Fig. 5, i∗\nld is obtained from the\ndc voltage outer loop and i∗\nlq is found from the power factor\nloop. Thus, for a power factor to equal “1”, i∗\nlq tends to zero.\nIf the d axis with the network voltage is considered to be in\none direction, eq = 0 is reached. Therefore, according to Fig.\n5, equation (12) could be simpliﬁed as follows:\n\n\n\nLdild\ndt = (Kp + KI\ns )(i∗\nld −ild )\nLdilq\ndt = (Kp + KI\ns )ilq\n(13)\nwhere, Kp , KI are control coefﬁcients.\n2) Control method for the isolation stage:In the isolation\nstage, the DC voltage obtained from the input stage is mod-\nulated into a medium frequency square wave and is coupled\nto the secondary side. Then, the resultant voltage is converted\ninto a DC voltage.\nHere, the task of the medium frequency transformer is\nisolation, as well as the control of voltage level ﬂuctuations.\nAn electronic power converter can change the voltage level\ndirectly, but there is enormous pressure on semiconductor\nequipment due to high frequencies [15].\nTo simplify the design of the control system, an open loop\nPWM controller is applied for the H-bridge-1 converter. If the\npower transmission is wanted only in one direction, then a\ndiode rectiﬁer should be used. Hence, a proportional ampliﬁer\ncan be used for the isolation stage. A simpliﬁed model of this\nis shown as follows:\nVdc2 = 1\nkVdc1 (14)\nwhere, k is transformation ratio of the MFT, and Vdc1 and\nVdc2 are the dc bus voltages of the input and output stages,\nrespectively.\n3) Control method for the output stage: The output is\ndirectly connected to the consumer. Therefore, its output\nvoltage should be a ﬁxed amount. As mentioned earlier, there\nare three single-phase inverters in this stage and each inverter\nhas its own separate output phase. Hence, controlling each\none can be done independently. In order to connect a load in\nthe output, the inverter should be controlled as a single-phase\nsinusoidal voltage source.\nAs can be seen, when the switching frequency is larger\nthan the reference signal, the inverter can be controlled as a\nproportional ampliﬁer. Therefore, the mathematical model for\nthe output stage is deﬁned as follows:\n\n\n\nCf\nduL\ndt = if −iL\nLf\ndi f\ndt = uo −uL\n(15)\nwhere the parameters of the equation are as deﬁned previously\nafter equations (1) to (4).\nImproving the Dynamic Performance of Distribution Electronic Power Transformers··· 149\nFig. 5. Control diagram of input stage based on PI controller.\nThe loads in distribution systems are mostly considered to\nbe passive. Therefore, the constant ac voltage is controlled as\nan instantaneous feedback amount [16]. The control design of\nthe output stage, based on PI controllers, is shown in Fig. 6.\nThere are two control loops in this ﬁgure. The two signals,\nincluding the output effective voltage ( Uo ) and the instanta-\nneous output voltage ( uo ), are considered as feedback signals.\nThe output effective voltage is used for regulating the output\nloop and the instantaneous output voltage in the inner loop is\nused for obtaining a sinusoidal output voltage.\nTheoretically, the output effective voltage remains constant\nuntil the load changes. Moreover, the output voltage can\nproduce a sinusoidal waveform. To avoid phase angle errors,\na proportional control (P) is used for the inner loop. It is\nnecessary to note that the three-phase control design is that\nof a single-phase control. The only different is the 120 ◦phase\nangles for the sinusoidal signals.\nB. LQR for a DEPT\nOne method for controlling multi-input multi-output\n(MIMO) systems is using state feedbacks. Nowadays, the\ndesign method of a linear quadratic regulator is widely applied\nas a modern optimal control method [4], [7], [17]. The main\ntask of this method is controlling the static variables in small\nsignal performance. This type of controller is appropriate for\nmulti-input multi-output systems [17], [18]. Since a DEPT is\na multi-input multi-output system, an LQR can be used to take\ncontrol of a 3-wire DEPT to improve its dynamic performance.\nThe LQR performance index to be minimized is as follows:\nJ = 1\n2\n∫ ∞\n0\n(xT\na Qxa +uT Ru)dt (16)\nwhere the diagonal matrices Q,R deﬁne the output and input\nweights, respectively.\nThe input control u, which is used to minimize the perfor-\nmance index is deﬁned as a feedback, as:\nu = −Kxa (17)\nThe gain matrix of the state feedback is deﬁned as:\nK = R−1BT P (18)\nwhere P is determined by the Riccati equation\nQ −PBR−1BT P +AT P +PA = 0. (19)\nThe state space model of equations (8) to (11) is suitable\nfor large signal operation in a nonlinear form. Therefore, the\ncorresponding reference amounts can be used. This model is\nobtained by putting the mentioned equations equal to zero and\nby replacing all of the variables with their steady states.\nThe operating points of the nominal steady state include:\nild = Ild ,ilq = Ilq,if d= If d,if q= If q,iLd = ILd,iLq = ILq\nuLd = ULd,uLq = ULq,us = Us,udc = Udc,m1 = M1,θ1 = θ∗\n1\nm2 = M2,θ2 = θ∗\n2\nThe used small signal model, which has been linearized\naround operating points, is:\nd∆x\ndt = A.∆x +B.∆u +E.∆v (20)\nwhere:\n∆x = [∆ild ∆ilq ∆udc ∆if d ∆if q ∆uLd ∆uLq ]T\n∆u = [∆m1 ∆θ1 ∆m2 ∆θ2 ]T\n∆v = [∆usd ∆usq ∆iLd ∆iLq ]T\nThe non-zero elements of the A,B,E matrix are shown in\nthe appendix.\nThe LQR is naturally a proportional regulator. Thus, to\neliminate the steady state errors in response to a step refer-\nence or a disturbance facing the system, an integral optimal\nregulator is required. The main task of this regulator is ﬁnding\nthe optimal input that reduces the state variables to zero with\na fast response. Equation (20) is transformed to an optimal\nintegral regulator by adding new variables to the state space.\nWith regards to the four aims of the DEPT, the four\nvariables ∆ild ,∆udc,∆uLd,∆uLq should be controlled and their\nintegrals added to the small signal model. Then the following\nis obtained:\n150 Journal of Power Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 2012\nFig. 6. Control strategy of output stage.\nd∆xa\ndt = Aa.∆x +Ba.∆u +Ea.∆v (21)\nwhere,\n∆xa = [∆ild ∆ilq ∆udc ∆if d∆if q∆uLd ∆uLq∫\n∆ild\n∫\n∆udc\n∫\n∆uLd\n∫\n∆uLq]T\nThe non-zero elements of the Aa,Ba,Ea matrices are similar\nto the A,B,E matrices. Only the following non-zero elements\nare added to the A matrix:\na81 = 1, a93 = 1,a106 = 1, a117 = 1\nEquation (21) shows that the state variables ∆ild ,∆udc,\n∆uLd,∆uLq are close to zero in their steady state. By consid-\nering the four control aims of the DEPT, the control system\nreference amounts can be determined as follows:\nIld = 0, ULd = 0,ULq,= 1,Udc = 1\nFig. 7 shows the LQR control structure, where I is the\nintegral operand [19].\nC. SMC for a DEPT\nSliding mode control is a nonlinear controller that can\nproperly control a system in the presence of structured and un-\nstructured uncertainties. In other words, sliding mode control\nis one of the most important control methods that possesses\nnon-linear characteristics together with robust properties. This\ncontroller has the advantages of non-sensitivity to external\ndisturbances, a fast transient response, design simplicity, sim-\npliﬁed execution and reduced calculations. In this method, the\ncontrol law is usually formed by two separate parts. The ﬁrst\npart should provide the state of the system towards the sliding\nsurface. The other part is to keep the system state on the sliding\nsurface.\nConsider the following single input dynamic system:\nx(n) = f (X)+ b(X)u\nwhere,\nx : considered output\nu : control input\nf (X),b(X) : non-linear functions containing uncertainties\nwith known bounds\nX(t) = [x ˙x .... x(n−1) ]T : system state vector\nIf the desired state vector is considered as Xd, then the\nfollowing is obtained:\n˜X = X −Xd = [ ˜x ˙˜x ... ˜x(n−1) ]T (22)\nThe control law for u should be in such a way that the state\nvector X can follow the desired state vector Xd . The purpose\nof this activity is so that ˜X will to tend to zero. Therefore,\ndesigning the sliding mode control includes the following main\nparts:\n1) Designing a sliding surface for reaching the system\nrequirements: Regarding this matter, a variable surface with\ntime s(t) in the state space R(n) is deﬁned with the scalar\nequation of s(X,t) =0, which is known as the sliding surface\nor the switching surface [20], [21]:\ns(x,t) = (d\ndt +λ)(n−1) ˜X (23)\nwhere, λ deﬁnes the eigenvalue of a closed loop of a system\non the sliding surface and is always selected as a positive\nnumber.\n2) Designing a control law for conducting the system\ntowards the sliding surface:In this method, the control law\nis established in two parts and each part has special role in\ncontrolling the system. The sliding control law all together, is\ndeﬁned as:\nu(t) =ueq(t)−un(t) (24)\nThe control signal in the sliding mode control should be\ndesigned in such a way that the sliding condition exists. For\nthis system, it is assumed that the approximations of the\nf (X),b(X) function be as ˆf (X), ˆb(X), so that:\n{\nˆf = fmax + fmin\n2ˆb = (bminbmax)1/2\n(25)\nHence, the control signal is selected as follows:\nu(t) =1\nˆb [ ˆu(t)−ksign(s)] (26)\nWhere, sign(s) is known as the switching function and is\nas follows:\nsign(s) =\n\n\n\n1 s > 0\n0 s = 0\n−1 s < 0\n(27)\nAlso, ˆu(t) and k are deﬁned as:\nˆu(t) =\n[\n−ˆf +x(n)\nd −λ ˜x(n−1) −.... −λ(n−1) ˜x\n]\n(28)\nImproving the Dynamic Performance of Distribution Electronic Power Transformers··· 151\nFig. 7. Control strategy of output stage.\nk ≥B(η +F)+( B −1)|ˆu| (29)\nWhere B,F are determined as follows:\nB =\n√\nbmax\nbmin\n, 0 < bmin < b < bmax , F ≥\n⏐⏐f −ˆf\n⏐⏐\nIt is clear that the k function depends on the system\nuncertainties amounts and disturbances.\nThe existence of uncertainties in the system and the lim-\nitation of the high switching frequency have effects on the\nsliding mode control design. This effect is so that the system\nstate should not remain on the switching surface, and vibrate\naround it which causes a chattering phenomenon to occur. This\nphenomenon is not appropriate, because it causes an increase\nin the control activities and excitation of the high frequencies\nunmodelled dynamics of the system and it may even lead to\ninstability of the system. Thus, a lot of application research\nhas been done to eliminate these problems. Sliding control\nwith ﬁxed boundary layers, variable boundary layers and the\nintegral sliding surface are common methods used to eliminate\nchattering. The ﬁrst method, which is used in this paper, is\ngoing to be brieﬂy described.\nInstead of the sign(s) function, deﬁned in equation (27), the\nsaturation function should be applied for using the boundary\nlayer in the sliding control. The φ parameter introduces the\nthickness of the boundary layer. In other words, the system\nstates in a boundary region are placed around the sliding\nsurface, in this method. The form of this function for a ﬁxed\nboundary layer, which is equal to φ, is as follows:\nsat( s\nφ ) =\n\n\n\n1 s > φ\ns\nφ −φ ≤s ≤φ\n−1 s < φ\n(30)\nIV. P ROPOSED SMC M ETHOD IN CONTROLLING DEPT\nSince a 3-wire DEPT is formed by nonlinear equations,\nSMC is used in order to improve its dynamic performance\nand to obtain suitable steady state behavior.\nild ,ilq,if d,if q were selected from equations (8) to (11), as\nstate variables and appropriate state vectors i∗\nld ,i∗\nlq,i∗\nf d,i∗\nf qwere\nconsidered. To design the SMC, four sliding levels (switching\nlevels) were selected for the system as follow:\n\n\n\ns1(ild ) =ild −i∗\nld\ns2(ilq) =ilq −i∗\nlq\ns3(if d) =if d−i∗\nf d\ns4(if q) =if q−i∗\nf q.\n(31)\nThe control laws are determined by differentiating equation\n(31) and using the dynamic equation to conduct the system\ntowards the sliding surface. According to the above selected\nsliding surfaces, four control inputs are obtained as follows:\nThe ﬁrst input:\n˙s1(ild ) =0 ⇒˙ild −˙i∗\nld = 0 ⇒−(R/L)ild −ωilq\n+(m1 sinθ1udc)/L = 0\n⇒m1 sinθ1udc = L((R/L)ild +ωilq) =u1\n(32)\nThe second input:\n˙s2(ilq) =0 ⇒˙ilq −˙i∗\nlq = 0 ⇒−(R/L)ilq +ωild\n−(m1 cosθ1udc −\n√\n2us)/L = 0\n⇒(m1 cosθ1udc −\n√\n2us) =L((R/L)ilq −ωild ) =u2\n(33)\nThe third input:\n˙s3(if d) =0 ⇒˙if d−˙i∗\nf d= 0 ⇒−ωif d−(uLq/Lf )\n−(m2 sinθ2udc)/Lf = 0\n⇒m2 sinθ2udc = −Lf (ωif d+(uLq/Lf )) =u3\n(34)\nThe fourth input:\n152 Journal of Power Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 2012\n˙s4(if q) =0 ⇒˙if q−˙i∗\nf q= 0 ⇒ωif d−(uLq/Lf )\n+(m2 cosθ2udc)/Lf = 0\n⇒m2 cosθ2udc = Lf ((uLq/Lf )−ωif d) =u4\n(35)\nSince i∗\nld ,i∗\nlq,i∗\nf d,i∗\nf q are constants, ˙i∗\nld , ˙i∗\nlq, ˙i∗\nf d, ˙i∗\nf q are equal\nto zero in equations (32) to (35).\nTo analyze the DEPT and to evaluate the proposed control\nsystem, some disturbances are applied to the system input\nvoltage. The disturbances are in the form of voltage sags,\nﬂickers, voltage harmonics and voltage unbalances, hence the\nexisting nonlinear functions are considered for equation (22).\nTo eliminate the disturbances via applying −ksign(s) to the\nsystem, the inputs u1 to u4 are formed as follows:\n\n\n\nu1 = −k1sign(s1)\n⇒m1 sinθ1udc = −k1sign(s1/φ1)\nu2 = −k2sign(s2)\n⇒m1 cosθ1udc −\n√\n2us = −k2sign(s2/φ2)\nu3 = −k3sign(s3)\n⇒m2 sinθ2udc = −k3sign(s3/φ3)\nu4 = −k4sign(s4)\n⇒m2 cosθ2udc = −k4sign(s4/φ4)\n(36)\nThe chattering phenomenon is faced a consideration of\nequation (36). Thus, to eliminate this phenomenon, the bound-\nary layer in the sliding mode control is used and the function\n“sat(s/φ)” replaces “ sign(s).” Therefore, the system input is\nre-written by the use of the sat(s/φ) function as follows:\n\n\n\nu1 = −k1sat(s1/φ1)\n⇒m1 sinθ1udc = −k1sat(s1/φ1)\nu2 = −k2sat(s2/φ2)\n⇒m1 cosθ1udc −\n√\n2us = −k2sat(s2/φ2)\nu3 = −k3sat(s3/φ3)\n⇒m2 sinθ2udc = −k3sat(s3/φ3)\nu4 = −k4sat(s4/φ4)\n⇒m2 cosθ2udc = −k4sat(s4/φ4)\n(37)\nBy accurate regulation of k1,k2,k3,k4 the disturbance to\nthe distribution system can be reduced, and the parameters\n“m1,θ1,m2,θ2” can be obtained, which are required for the\nSPWM block. Fig. 8 shows the proposed sliding mode control.\nIn this ﬁgure, regarding equation (37), the considered con-\ntrol system inputs are generated. It is worth mentioning that\nthe system inputs include “ m1,θ1,m2,θ2,” which should be\nseparated from each other, in a proper way.\nThe m1,θ1 signals to the ﬁrst SPWM block and the m2,θ2\nsignals to the second SPWM block are applied, so the blocks\ncan generate signals related to the DEPT input stage converter\ngates and the DEPT output stage converter, respectively.\nStability Analysis of the Propose SMC: In order to\nevaluate the stability of this method, it should be veriﬁed\nthat the sliding surface is an absorbent surface such that the\nsystem states always move towards it. For this purpose, the\nLyapunov’s theorem is used by considering the Lyapunov\nfunction candidate as follows:\nV(s) =1\n2s2. (38)\nFig. 8. The proposed sliding mode control.\nAccording to Lyapunov’s direct theorem, the stability con-\ndition is presented as follows:\n˙V(s) =1\n2\nd\ndt (s2) =s˙s < 0. (39)\nThis equation is called the sliding condition as well. Since\nV(s) is clearly positive deﬁnite, if ˙V(s) is negative deﬁnite,\ni.e., the sliding condition is satisﬁed, then the equilibrium at\nthe origin s=0 is globally asymptotically stable. Therefore,\ns tends to zero as the time tends to inﬁnity. Moreover, all\nof the trajectories starting off the sliding surface s = 0 must\nreach it in a ﬁnite time and then remain on this surface. The\ncontrol signal must be realized as this sliding condition is\nprovided in the presence of the parameter nonlinearity and\nuncertainty. By replacing the related equations in the above\nmentioned condition and using the proposed control law and\nsome mathematical manipulations, the sliding condition is\nsatisﬁed, if the coefﬁcients k1,k2,k3,k4 are selected properly\nin high values as follows:\n\n\n\nL((R/L)ild +ωilq) =−k1sat(s1/φ1)\n⇒k1 = −L((R/L)ild +ωilq)/sat(s1/φ1)\nL((R/L)ilq −ωild ) =−k2sat(s2/φ2)\n⇒k2 = −L((R/L)ilq −ωild )/sat(s2/φ2)\n−Lf (ωif d+(uLq/Lf )) =−k3sat(s3/φ3)\n⇒k3 = Lf (ωif d+(uLq/Lf ))/sat(s3/φ3)\nLf ((uLq/Lf )−ωif d) =−k4sat(s4/φ4)\n⇒k4 = −Lf ((uLq/Lf )−ωif d)/sat(s4/φ4).\n(40)\nV. S IMULATION RESULTS\nIn this section, the results of the proposed SMC on DEPT\nperformance are presented. To express the capabilities of the\nproposed method, the results will be compared with those of\na PI controller and a LQR. It is worth mentioning that the\nforms of the input voltage, the DC-link voltage and the output\nvoltage are obtained by MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The\nDEPT parameters are indicated in Table I.\nImproving the Dynamic Performance of Distribution Electronic Power Transformers··· 153\nTABLE I\nBASIC PARAMETERS OF DEPT\ninput voltages 10 KV\noutput voltages 400 V\nEPT’s rated capacity 500KV A\nfrequency of network 50Hz\nfrequency of MFT 1000Hz\ncapacitor of input stage 1000µF\ninput inductor 10mH\nﬁlter capacitor 800µF\nﬁlter inductor 0.24mH\nload capacity 500KV A@0.8\nA. Generation an unbalance in the input voltage\nIt is assumed in this situation that an unbalanced in the\nvoltage is generated in the phases. Fig. 9 shows the simulation\nresults regarding a case where an unbalance voltage occurred\nin the input, at 0.15 to 0.2 sec. In this case, the voltage\namplitude of phase A has about a %70 voltage sag. The\nfrequency of phase B is adjusted to 49Hz and the angle of\nphase C is 80 ◦. As can be seen in this ﬁgure, the input is\na three-phase voltage with an intense unbalanced condition.\nHowever, the three-phase output voltage is in sinusoidal and\nsymmetrical forms, as a result of using the proposed control\nprocess.\nB. Flicker generation in the input voltage\nIn this case, the input has a sinusoidal wave shape with\na frequency of 10Hz and a modulation index of %10. Fig.\n10 shows the waveforms under a voltage ﬂicker. This ﬂicker\noccurs in the input voltage at 0.15 to 0.2 sec. As can be seen,\nthe ﬂicker is eliminated in the output voltage and therefore,\nthis voltage has no ﬂicker. Also, the DC-link voltage reaches\nits real amount (about 20kV) after applying the ﬂicker.\nC. Generation of voltage sag in the input\nIt is assumed in this case that the three-phase input faces a\nvoltage sag of about %40. Fig. 11 shows the simulation results\nunder such voltage sags at 0.5 to 0.2 sec. From this ﬁgure,\nit can be seen that by using the proposed SMC, the output\nvoltage remains ﬁxed and sinusoidal, despite the primary\nvoltage sag. Also, the DC-link voltage reaches the previous\nconstant amount, before the application of a voltage sag at\n0.23 sec.\nD. Distortion generation in the input waveform\nIt is assumed in this situation that voltage harmonics of\nthe 5 th and 7 th orders with amplitudes of %10 and %8,\nrespectively, are applied on the input voltage. Fig. 12 shows\nthe result of the simulation of this situation, with consideration\nof the proposed SMC. As can be seen in this ﬁgure, despite the\nhigh amplitudes of the harmonics, the voltage is completely\nsinusoidal and symmetrical. Also, the DC-link voltage reaches\na ﬁxed amount of 20kV , at 0.19 sec.\nE. Generation of a voltage swell in the input\nIt is assumed in this case that the three-phase input faces a\nvoltage swelling of about %40. Fig. 13 shows the waveforms\nunder voltage swelling at 0.15 to 0.2 sec.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 9. Waveforms under unbalance voltage. (a) Input voltages. (b) DC-link\nvoltage. (c) output voltages.\nFrom this ﬁgure, it can be seen that by using the proposed\nSMC, the output voltage remains ﬁxed and sinusoidal. Also,\nthe DC-link voltage reaches 20kV after applying the swelling.\nAs can be seen, the swelling is eliminated in the output voltage\nand therefore, this voltage has no swelling.\nThe DC-link voltage reaching its real value faster indicates\nthat the considered controller responds faster to distribution\nsystem disturbances and is on the point of reducing the effects\nof these disturbances in the DC-link. Hence, from Figs. 10 to\n13 (b), it can be seen that:\n1- A DC-link with a linear quadratic regulator is preferred\nover the PI controller.\n2- A DC-link with the sliding mode controller is preferred\n154 Journal of Power Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 2012\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 10.

These results show that the system response overshoot\nin the case of using proposed SMC in comparison with LQR\nand PI methods is less. Moreover, by using the proposed SMC,\nthe steady state error reaches to zero. However with other\nmethods, this error does not vanish, which shows the other\nadvantage of the proposed strategy.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 11. Waveforms under voltage sags. (a) input voltages.

Then to improve the DEPT dynamic\nperformance, a design for a control system was proposed on\nthe basis of the SMC. Also, to compare the proposed controller\nperformance, the SMC method was compared with the control\nmethods of PI and LQR. In the sliding mode control distur-\nbances of the distribution system were rejected by four sliding\nsurface and a proper control law. The simulation results show\nthat the DEPT performance has an appropriate dynamic and\nsteady state performance as a result of using the SMC design,\nwhen compared to the PI and LQR controllers.
