  "abstract": "This study explores the potential benefits of employing generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) in recreational tourism, the difficulties that arise when implementing such technology, the impact it has on tourist behaviour, and the ways it can be utilised in recreational tourism management. The original aspect of the study is that it is the first to give detailed information about the use of GPT in recreational tourism. ChatGPT was used as an interviewer in the study. ChatGPT is a software application that utilizes the high-powered machine learning software called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3), developed by the OpenAI organization. Six questions were posed on the ChatGPT query screen (https://chat.openai.com/chat). The interview queries were prepared with reference to the study by Fusté-Forné and Orea-Giner (2023). The question statements in this study on the use of GPT in gastronomy tourism were changed to recreational tourism. ChatGPT's replies were tabulated and presented descriptively. Inferences and suggestions were made in line with the answers given by ChatGPT. The study showed that using GPT technology in recreational-based tourism can offer better customer interaction, decision-making, and a personalized travel experience. ChatGPT underlined that new technologies continue to evolve, and recreational-based tourism will become more personalized, informative, and immersive, ultimately enhancing the overall travel experience, and contributing to the growth and sustainability of the tourism industry. ChatGPT also noted GPT models have the potential to shape and enhance the entire travel experience for tourists, from the initial planning stages to the actual trip itself. Although GPT makes significant contributions to recreational tourism management and recreational tourists, there are deficiencies in ethical, privacy, and authenticity concerns.",
