  "abstract": "The condition of oil-paper insulation is closely related to the life expectancy of a transformer. The accurate results of oil-paper have not been obtained due to the impact of influencing factors. Therefore, in order to improve the evaluation accuracy of oil-paper insulation, in this paper, oil-paper samples which were prepared with different aging and moisture content were analyzed by frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS). Results show that when the moisture content is less than 2%, the range of 101~103 Hz is mainly affected by moisture and aging has little effect. However, with the increase of moisture content, the effect of aging degree on this band became increasingly prominent. Sm, which represents the integral value from 10−1 to 10−3 Hz, and SDP, which represents the integral value from 101 to 103 Hz, were extracted as characteristic parameters of moisture content and aging degree respectively. Compensation factors γ which represents the influence ratio of moisture on SDP and φ which represents the influence ratio of aging on Sm were introduced to compensate for the influence of moisture content and aging degree on characteristics respectively. Then, a new method was proposed to evaluate the condition of oil-paper based on compensation factors. Through this method, the influence in characteristics can be eliminated by the obtained actual compensation factors, thus distinguishing the internal influence between moisture content and aging degree on FDS. Finally, this method was verified by field test.",
