[6] studied how influence operations under-\nmined the vaccine debate in public health. To help combat misin-\nformation on social media, Twitter began releasing user accounts\nassociated with state-sponsored influence activities. Our work uses\nthis dataset for troll detection, and as such a troll in our context is\na state-sponsored agent with links to an influence campaign.\nExisting troll detection models focus on extracting signals from\nuser online posts and user activities [ 1–3, 8, 10, 12, 32]. Recent\nneural approaches explore fusing different feature representations\nfor troll detection, e.g. social structure, source posts and propagated\nposts such as retweets on Twitter [3, 39]. These studies generally\nformulate the task as a standard supervised learning problem which\nrequires a substantial amount of labelled data for known campaigns.\nAs such, they are ill-equipped to detect novel campaigns sponsored\nby another state for a different target.\nMeta-learning is a well-established framework for few-shot learn-\ning [14, 16, 28, 33, 35]. The idea of meta-learning is to leverage the\nshared knowledge from previous tasks to facilitate the learning\nof new tasks. In our context, meta-learning has the potential to\nquickly adapt a troll detection model to a new campaign via few-\nshot transfer, once it’s meta-trained on a set of known campaigns.\nHowever, in a continual learning setting where the troll detection\nmodel needs to be constantly updated to work with new campaigns\nover time, the standard meta-learning framework suffers from cata-\nstrophic forgetting — the problem where the model “forgets” how to\ndetect trolls from the older campaigns as they are updated [36, 37].\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows:\n•We introduce a troll detection problem under a realistic set-\nting where novel campaigns continually emerge, mimicking\nreal-world events on social media platforms.\n•We propose MetaTroll, a text-based meta-learning frame-\nwork for troll detection, which includes a three-stage meta-\ntraining process that allows it to learn knowledge across\ndifferent campaigns for fast adaptation to new campaigns.\n•MetaTroll tackles catastrophic forgetting by introducing\ncampaign-specific transformer adapters [19] (i.e. each cam-\npaign has its own set of adapter parameters), which can\n“memorise” campaign-specific knowledge.\n•MetaTroll has the ability to to work with multiple languages\n(multilingual) by using a pretrained multilingual model and\nincorporate images as an additional input (multimodal) by\n1https://www.adelaide.edu.au/newsroom/news/list/2021/12/09/understanding-mass-\ninfluence-activities-is-critical.\narXiv:2303.07354v1  [cs.CL]  13 Mar 2023\nWWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Lin Tian, Xiuzhen Zhang, and Jey Han Lau\neither encoding them using pretrained image classifiers or\nconverting them into text via optical character recognition.\n•Large-scale experiments on a real-world dataset of 14 Twitter\ncampaigns showed the superior performance of MetaTroll.\n2 RELATED WORK\nOur related work comes from three areas, troll detection, meta-\nlearning and few-shot text classification.\n2.1 Troll detection\nEarly studies of troll detection focus on extracting hand-engineered\nfeatures from the textual contents of user posts for troll detection [8,\n10, 12, 12, 25, 31]. Signals such as writing style, sentiment as well as\nemotions have been explored [10, 31]. User online activities have\nalso been used to detect trolls [ 8, 12]. Cheng et al. [8] presents a\nstudy on anti-social behavior in online discussion communities,\nfocusing on users that will eventually be banned.\nMore recently, approaches that combine user posts and online\nactivities for troll detection have emerged [ 1, 3, 4, 13, 20, 32, 34].\nAddawood et al. [1] identify 49 linguistic markers of deception and\nmeasure their use by troll accounts. They show that such deceptive\nlanguage cues can help to accurately identify trolls. Im et al. [20]\npropose a detection approach that relies on users’ metadata, activity\n(e.g. number of shared links, retweets, mentions, etc.), and linguistic\nfeatures to identify active trolls on Twitter. Shafiei and Dadlani[32]\nshow that Russian trolls aim to hijack the political conversation to\ncreate distrust among different groups in the community. Stewart\nand Dawson [34] similarly demonstrate how trolls act to accentuate\ndisagreement and sow division along divergent frames, and this\nis further validated by Dutt et al . [13] in relation to Russian ads\non Facebook. In Badawy et al. [4], the authors study the effects of\nmanipulation campaigns by analysing the accounts that endorsed\ntrolls’ activity on Twitter. They find that conservative-leaning users\nre-shared troll content 30 times more than liberal ones. Zannettou\net al. [39] compare troll behavior with other (random) Twitter ac-\ncounts by recognising the differences in the content they spread,\nthe evolution of their accounts, and the strategies they adopted\nto increase their impact. Atanasov et al . [3] leverage both social\nstructure and textual contents to learn user representations via\ngraph embedding. We focus on how to detect trolls in emergent\nsocial activities with limited labelled data.\n2.2 Meta-learning\nMeta-learning aims to extract some transferable knowledge from a\nset of tasks to quickly adapt to a new task. These approaches can be\ndivided into three categories: metric-based, optimisation-based, and\nmodel-based. Metric-based meta-learning approaches [33, 35] aim\nto learn an embedding function to encode the input and a metric\nfunction to learn the distance (e.g. cosine distance and euclidean\ndistance) between the query data and support data. Optimisation-\nbased approaches [14, 16] are designed to learn good parameter\ninitialisation that can quickly adapt to new tasks within a few\ngradient descent steps. Model-based approaches [26, 30] use neural\nnetworks to embed task information and predict test examples\nconditioned on the task information. Our approach combines both\noptimisation and model-based ideas in that we adopt [14] to update\nmodel parameters and a novel architecture that involves adapters\nand adaptive classification layers to learn task information.\n2.3 Few-shot text classification\nText classification has shifted from task-specific training to pre-\ntrained language models (such as BERT) followed by task-specific\nfine-tuning [11, 27]. Recently, the language model GPT-3 [7] has\nshown strong few-shot performance for many natural language\nprocessing tasks. Few-shot text classification refer to a text classifi-\ncation setting where there are novel unseen tasks (domains) with\nonly a few labelled examples for training a classification model,\nand meta-learning have been shown to produce strong perfor-\nmance [5, 15, 17, 38]. Bao et al . [5] introduce distributional sig-\nnatures, such as word frequency and information entropy, into a\nmeta-learning framework. Gao et al. [15] combine attention mech-\nanism with prototypical network to solve noisy few-shot relation\nclassification task. Geng et al. [17] leverage the dynamic routing\nalgorithm in meta-learning to solve sentiment and intent text clas-\nsification tasks for English and Chinese datasets. Yu et al . [38]\npropose an adaptive metric-based method that can determine the\nbest weighted combination automatically. In our problem setting,\nour focus is on adapting the classifier to a new task (i.e. campaign)\nunder the meta-learning framework.\n3 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nWe first explain some preliminaries of meta-learning, and contex-\ntualise it under our problem setting, before describing our model\nin Section 4. Let E= {𝑒0,𝑒1,𝑒2,...,𝑒 𝑙}be a set of campaigns. These\ncampaigns are split into two partitions: E𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 for meta-training\nand E𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 for meta-testing (in our case, we have 6 campaigns for\nE𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛, and 4 for E𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡; see Table 1). For each campaign 𝑒, we have\nlabeled users U, where each user u consists of a list of text posts\nand images, defined as u = {(𝑐0,𝑚0,𝑝0),..., (𝑐𝑛,𝑚𝑛,𝑝𝑛)}, where 𝑐\nrefers to the textual content of the post, 𝑚a set of images, and 𝑝\nthe timestamp of the post. Each user u is associated with a ground-\ntruth label𝑦 ∈𝑌, where𝑌 represents the label set (troll or non-troll;\nbinary). Our goal is to leverage the knowledge learned from past\n(meta-train) campaigns (E𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛) to adapt quickly to new (meta-test)\ncampaigns (E𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡) via few-shot learning (e.g. 5 or 10 users for the\nnew campaign).\nIn our problem setting, the notion of a task (from meta-learning)\nis the binary troll detection task for a particular campaign . Each task\nT𝑖 = (D𝑠,D𝑞)includes a support set D𝑠 with 𝑆 data points and a\nquery set D𝑞 with 𝑄 data points, where D𝑠 =\n\b\nu𝑠\n𝑖,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖\n\t𝑆\n𝑖=1 ,D𝑞 =\n\b\nu𝑞\n𝑖,𝑦𝑞\n𝑖\n\t𝑄\n𝑖=1, and u𝑖 is a user with a list of posts and images and\n𝑦𝑖 ∈{0,1}corresponding to troll/non-troll labels (as defined above).\nDuring meta-training, we iterate through different campaign in\nE𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and sample support and query instances to train the model.\nOnce that’s done, to adapt to a new campaigns inE𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡, we follow a\nsimilar training process but we update the model parameters using\nonly the support instances from the new campaign, and reserve the\nquery set for evaluation (i.e. the query set is not used for model\nupdate).\nMetaTroll: Few-shot Detection of State-Sponsored Trolls with Transformer Adapters WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA\nRussia-2016-MAGA\nFeature \nExtractor \nTroll\nNon-Troll\nX\n+\nIran-2018-Pakistan\nAggregator\n \nIran-2018-Palestine\nAdaptive \nlinear \nclassifier \nBERT\nIran-2018-Pakistan\nAdapter\nBERT\nRussia-2016-MAGA\nAdapter\nBERT\nIran-2018-Palestine\nAdapter\nDataset\nmean-pooling \nfor  \nLinear \nclassifier\nFigure 1: Overall architecture of MetaTroll.\n4 APPROACH\nWe present the overall architecture of MetaTroll in Figure 1. Meta-\nTroll has two modules, a BERT-based [11] feature extractor and an\nadaptive linear classifier.\nWe first explain at a high level how we train MetaTroll in three\nstages for the feature extractor and linear classifier (Algorithm 1).\nIn the first stage, we fine-tune an off-the-shelf BERT and update all\nits parameters (Φ) using all training samples from the meta-train\ncampaigns E𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 (line 1 in Algorithm 1). At this stage we do not\nintroduce adapters [19] to BERT and it is optimised to do binary\nclassification of trolls and non-trolls. The idea of this step is to\ntrain a feature extractor for the troll detection task (in other words,\nthis step is standard fine-tuning to adapt BERT for binary troll\ndetection).\nIn the second stage, we introduce adapters [19] to BERT and train\nthe adapter parameters ( Ψ) using model agnostic meta-learning\n(MAML: Finn et al . [14] ; line 3–16 in Algorithm 1). Note that\nthe adapter is shared across all campaigns (i.e. the adapter is not\ncampaign-specific), and the idea of this stage is to learn a good\ninitialisation for the adapter to do general troll detection; in the\nnext stage, the learned adapter parameters will be used to initalise\ncampaign-specific adapters. During this stage, only the adapter pa-\nrameters (Ψ) are updated while the BERT parameters (Φ) are frozen.\nIn the third and final stage, we introduce campaign-specific\nadapters and adaptive linear classifiers to MetaTroll, creating the\nfull model. The campaign-specific adapters are initialised using\nthe campaign-general adapter from stage 2. The idea of using\ncampaign-specific adapters is to address catastrophic forgetting\nwhen MetaTroll is continuously updated for new campaigns that\nemerge over time in an application setting: the campaign-specific\nadapter solves the ‘forgetting’ problem because the knowledge of\ndetecting older/past campaigns are stored in their adapters which\nwill not be overwritten as MetaTroll is continually updated. As\nfor the adaptive linear classifiers, they are also campaign-specific\nand designed to encourage MetaTroll to learn campaign represen-\ntations that are distinct for different campaigns. 2 We update the\ncampaign-specific adapter (Ψ𝑒) and classifier parameters (Ω𝑒) via\n2The adaptive linear classifier parameters are initialised randomly for a new campaign.\nmeta-learning, similar to stage 2 training (line 17–32 in Algorithm 1),\nnoting that the BERT parameters (Φ) are frozen in this stage.\nAfter MetaTroll is trained (over the 3 stages), to adapt it to trolls\nof a new campaign at test time, we follow the third stage training to\nlearn campaign-specific adapter (Ψ𝑒) and classifier (Ω𝑒) parameters\nfor the new campaign. Once adapted, MetaTroll can be used to\nclassify users from this new campaign. We next describe the training\nstages and test inference in detail.\n4.1 Stage One Training\nIn the first stage, MetaTroll is a standard BERT fine-tuned with\nstandard cross entropy loss to do binary classification of trolls vs.\nnon-trolls (ignoring the campaigns). Given a user u with posts\n{𝑐0,...,𝑐 𝑛}:\n𝑣 = BERT([CLS]⊕ 𝑐0 ⊕... ⊕𝑐𝑛) (1)\nˆ𝑦 = softmax(𝑊𝑣 +𝑏) (2)\nwhere 𝑣is the contextual embedding of [CLS]and ⊕is the concate-\nnation operation.\n4.2 Stage Two Training\nIn the second stage, we add adapters to BERT (see Figure 2). Fol-\nlowing [19], we insert two adapter modules containing bottleneck\nlayers into each transformer layer of BERT. Note that the adapter\nis shared across all campaigns here, as the goal in this stage is to\nlearn good set of initial adapter parameter values that can be used\nto initialise campaign-specific adapters in the next stage.\nCorrespondingly, Equation 1 is now modified to:\n𝑣 = AdapterBERT([CLS]⊕ 𝑐0 ⊕... ⊕𝑐𝑛) (3)\nWe meta-train the adapter parameters using MAML (line 3–16\nin Algorithm 1). We first sample a task T𝑖 for campaign 𝑒 from\nE𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 to create the support 𝐷𝑠 and query set 𝐷𝑞.

Formally, Equation 3 is\nnow updated to:\n𝑣 = AdapterBERT𝑒([CLS]⊕ 𝑐0 ⊕... ⊕𝑐𝑛)\n3In our implementation, 𝛼is layer-specific, i.e. we have a separate learning rate for\neach adapter in different layers.\nMetaTroll: Few-shot Detection of State-Sponsored Trolls with Transformer Adapters WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA\nMulti-headed \nattention\nFeed-forward \nlayer\nAdapter\nLayer \nNorm\n2x \nFeed-forward \nlayers\nLayer \nNorm\nAdapter\nFeed-Forward\nDown\nFeed-Forward\nUp\nNonLinear\nFigure 2: Overall architecture of Adapter-BERT. The left fig-\nure illustrates how two adapter modules are added to a trans-\nformer layer; right shows the components in the adapter.\nwhere 𝑒 is the campaign.\nWe introduce campaign-specific adapters to our model for two\nreasons: (1) they are more efficient to train and less vulnerable to\noverfitting (which is important in a few-shot learning setting), since\nthey contain only a small number of parameters compared to the\nalternative where we have one BERT model for every campaign);\nand (2) they alleviate catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning\nsetting, as each campaign has its own adapter.\nInspired by Requeima et al. [28], we next introduce an adaptive\nlinear classifier network that replaces𝑊 and 𝑏in the linear layer\nused for classification (Equation 2). Intuitively, this adaptive clas-\nsifier works by first computing the aggregate troll and non-troll\nrepresentation for each campaign, and then learn campaign-specific\nprojections to classify between trolls vs. non-trolls. Let D𝑠\n0 and D𝑠\n1\ndenote the support set where the labels are trolls ( 𝑦 = 0) and\nnon-trolls (𝑦 = 1) respectively, we compute𝑊𝑒, 𝑏𝑒 and ˆ𝑦for troll\ncampaign 𝑒 as follows:\n𝑊0\n𝑒 = 1\f\fD𝑠\n0\n\f\f\n∑︁\n𝑣∈D𝑠\n0\n(𝑣) 𝑏0\n𝑒 = 1\f\fD𝑠\n0\n\f\f\n∑︁\n𝑣∈D𝑠\n0\n(𝑣)\n𝑊1\n𝑒 = 1\f\fD𝑠\n1\n\f\f\n∑︁\n𝑣∈D𝑠\n1\n(𝑣) 𝑏1\n𝑒 = 1\f\fD𝑠\n1\n\f\f\n∑︁\n𝑣∈D𝑠\n1\n(𝑣)\nˆ𝑦 = softmax(𝑊𝑒𝑣+𝑏𝑒)\nwhere 𝑊𝑖𝑒 denotes the (𝑖 −1)th column of 𝑊𝑒. In other words,\nMetaTroll classifies a user based on whether its representation (𝑣)\nis closer to the (average) troll or non-troll representation.\nThe campaign-specific adaptive linear classifier parameters Ω𝑒\nand the adapters parameters Ψ𝑒 are trained using MAML, just like\nstage 2 training (line 17–31 in Algorithm 1).\n4.4 Meta-testing\nAfter MetaTroll is trained, to adapt it to a new campaign 𝑒 , we\nfollow the process of the third stage training. To simulate few-\nshot learning, we sample only a small number of instances for the\nsupport and query set (e.g. 5 each), and use only the support set\nfor updating the adapter (Ψ𝑒) and classifier parameters (Ω𝑒) (line\n25–26 in Algorithm 1) and do not run the outer loop ((line 30–31).\nHere the query set is used only for computing performance (i.e. in\nline 27 we compute accuracy instead of loss over the query set).\n5 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n5.1 Datasets and models\nWe use the information operations dataset published by Twitter\nfor our experiments. 4 This dataset contains different groups of\nusers banned by Twitter since October 2018 for engaging in state-\nsponsored information operations, and each group represents a\ncampaign in our work. For example, the “Iran-2018-Palestine” cam-\npaign refers to trolls sponsored by Iran for an information campaign\ntargeting Palestine in 2018.5 To clarify, these campaigns are defined\nby Twitter when they release the data, and each campaign is asso-\nciated with a blogpost that explains the information operation.\nFor each campaign, we filter users and keep only those who have\nposted a tweet within the 6-month event period (“Event Time” in\nTable 1) to remove users who are inactive during the event.6 For\neach user, we also filter their tweets to keep only their most recent\n20 posts that have a timestamp within the event period.\nTo create the non-troll users, we combine two sources: (1) “Ran-\ndom”, random accounts that are sampled by generating random\nnumeric user IDs and validating their existence following [2]; and\n(2) “Hashtag”, users whose posts contain popular hashtags used by\na campaign, where popular hashtags are defined as hashtags that\ncollectively cover 75% of trolls’ posts. The reason why we have two\ntypes of non-troll users is that if we only sample random users as\nnon-trolls, the post content of non-trolls would be topically very\ndifferent to that of the trolls, and the detection task would degener-\nate into a topic detection task. The non-troll users sampled using\nthe “Hashtag” approach is designed to circumvent this and makes\nthe detection task more challenging.\nTable 1 present some statistics for trolls and non-trolls in different\ncampaigns, where 6 are used for meta-training and 4 for meta-\ntesting. Note that the non-trolls of a particular campaign are users\nsampled with the “Hashtag” approach, and the last row corresponds\nto non-troll users sampled using the “Random” approach. For these\ncampaigns, at least 80% of the trolls’ posts are in English, and so\nthey are used for the monolingual (English) experiments in the\npaper.7\nThe trolls and non-trolls in Table 1 represent the pool of users\nwhich we draw from to construct the final training/testing data. In\nall of our experiments, we keep the ratio of trolls to non-trolls to\n50/50 through sampling, and when sampling for non-troll users,\nthe ratio from the two sources (“Random” and “Hashtag”) is also\n50/50.8 As an example, “Uganda-2021-NRM” has 334 troll users. We\ntherefore sample 334 non-troll users, where 167 are from “Random”\nand another 167 from “Hashtag”.\n4https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/information-operations.html\n5https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/enabling-further-research-of-\ninformation-operations-on-twitter\n6The event period is determined as follows: (1) the end date is the last post in the\ncampaign; and the (2) start date is 6 months from the end date.\n7For non-troll users, we only keep English tweets (based on the predicted language\ngiven in the metadata).\n8We also only sample “Random” users whose most recent post is in the event time.\nWWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Lin Tian, Xiuzhen Zhang, and Jey Han Lau\nTable 1: Statistics of English meta-train and meta-test data.

In Sections\n5.4 and 5.5 we extend MetaTroll to work with non-English data\nand images. As we focus on English here, non-English posts are\ndiscarded (although this only reduces the data size by a negligible\namount, as most data is in English, as explained in Section 5.1). All\nreported figures are an average accuracy performance over 5 runs\nwith different random seeds.19\nTable 2 presents 5-shot and 10-shot results for the 4 meta-test\ncampaigns.20 MetaTroll is the best model, achieving an average of\n76.35% accuracy over all campaigns. That said, some of the few-shot\ntext classifiers (Induct e.g.73.57%) are not far behind. Most models\nonly benefit marginally by seeing 5 more examples going from 5-\nto 10-shot, with the exception of GPT3 where we see a substantial\nperformance boost (average 14.64% gain).\n5.3 Continual learning performance\nIn continual learning [29], new tasks appear over time, where the\ngoal of learning is to adapt the model accordingly to the new tasks\n17https://github.com/thunlp/HATT-Proto\n18https://github.com/YujiaBao/Distributional-Signatures\n19Noting that the performance for one run is an average performance over the query\nsets from multiple tasks.\n205-shot means only 5 labelled instances for each class are given in the support set.\nMetaTroll: Few-shot Detection of State-Sponsored Trolls with Transformer Adapters WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA\nTable 2: Troll detection accuracy in 5-shot and 10-shot settings.\nGRU-2020-NATO IRA-2020-Russia Uganda-2021-NRM China-2021-Xinjiang\nModel 5-shot 10-shot 5-shot 10-shot 5-shot 10-shot 5-shot 10-shot\nBERT [11] 50.41 51.39 ↑0.98 51.70 52.21 ↑0.51 55.96 56.53 ↑0.39 60.36 61.68 ↑1.32\nKNN [21] 46.10 48.91 ↑2.81 42.52 44.28 ↑1.76 46.74 48.49 ↑1.75 50.21 51.85 ↑1.37\nAdBERT [27] 65.05 66.73 ↑1.68 55.16 57.39 ↑2.23 52.24 56.27 ↑4.03 65.49 67.38 ↑1.89\nGPT3 [7] 54.25 71.39 ↑17.14 61.87 75.96 ↑14.09 52.49 69.66 ↑17.17 70.34 80.49 ↑10.15\nMAML [14] 70.13 72.43 ↑2.30 70.11 71.82 ↑1.71 61.11 65.74 ↑4.63 70.99 73.87 ↑2.85\nCNP [16] 69.88 71.26 ↑1.38 69.47 72.70 ↑3.23 64.48 66.95 ↑2.47 67.05 69.95 ↑2.90\nProtoNet [33] 60.43 62.87 ↑2.44 67.87 70.05 ↑2.18 64.43 67.79 ↑3.36 74.56 76.65 ↑2.09\nInduct [17] 71.11 72.26 ↑1.15 76.49 77.24↑0.75 71.55 73.50 ↑1.95 75.13 76.70 ↑1.57\nHATT [15] 63.02 65.56 ↑2.54 75.82 77.50 ↑1.68 60.45 63.87 ↑3.42 78.22 80.03 ↑1.81\nDS [5] 62.69 64.62 ↑1.93 66.05 68.92 ↑2.87 62.43 64.50 ↑2.07 71.74 73.43 ↑1.69\nMetaTroll 72.74 75.13 ↑2.39 76.25 77.99↑1.74 75.05 78.25 ↑3.20 81.37 84.50 ↑3.13\nTable 3: Catastrophic forgetting results under continual\nlearning. “G” = GRU-2020-NATO, “I” = IRA-2020-Russia, “U”\n= Uganda-2021-NRM, “C” = China-2021-Xinjiang.\nModel G→I G →I→U G →I →U→C\nG G G I G I U\nBERT [11] 50.41 45.16 48.02 44.80 42.85 43.25 50.00\nKNN [21] 46.10 45.25 43.12 49.99 43.01 45.50 45.33\nAdBERT [27] 65.05 62.41 54.59 52.56 50.54 53.74 49.95\nGPT3 [7] 54.25 51.92 50.33 58.88 48.93 56.87 50.06\nMAML [14] 70.13 68.32 65.15 56.55 57.62 50.04 54.87\nCNP [16] 69.88 71.55 68.72 56.75 60.57 56.95 63.21\nProtoNet [33] 60.43 56.56 61.05 61.99 53.47 52.83 60.05\nInduct [17] 71.11 69.50 62.82 66.13 58.43 63.52 64.83\nHATT [15] 63.02 60.50 55.62 70.18 50.25 50.11 55.43\nDS [5] 62.69 60.05 58.85 61.50 50.65 60.12 61.85\nMetaTroll 72.74 73.45 72.18 70.81 71.15 69.74 68.75\nTable 4: Campaign classification results under continual\nlearning.\nModel G→I G →I→U G →I →U→C\nI I U I U C\nGPT3 [7] 74.86 79.25 82.86 81.17 79.38 74.62\nMetaTroll 85.57 85.15 87.50 83.61 86.92 86.11\nwithout forgetting the previous tasks. This is a more realistic setting\nfor a troll detection system, as it should continually adapt to new\ncampaigns that appear over time. But in this setting it will suffer\nfrom catastrophic forgetting [36, 37], where after adapting to newer\ncampaigns its performance to classify older campaigns will degrade.\nTo simulate this continual learning setting, we next evaluate\nthe troll detection models on a past campaign after it has been\nadapted for a number of campaigns in sequence. For example, a\nsystem is first adapted to GRU-2020-NATO (G), and then to IRA-\n2020-Russia (I), Uganda-2021-NRM (U) and China-2021-Xinjiang\n(C) in sequence (denoted as G→I→U→C). We then test the system\nusing trolls using the past campaigns, i.e. G, I and U.\nOne challenge with MetaTroll under this continual learning\nevaluation is that at test time it needs to know which adapter to use\n— information that most other systems do not require as they don’t\nhave campaign-specific parameters (exception: AdBERT and GPT-\n321). We experiment a simple approach to solve this: have MetaTroll\nclassify a user using all its adapters, and select the outcome that\nhas the highest probability.22\nWe present (5-shot) troll classification results under this contin-\nual learning setting in Table 3. AdBERT and GPT-3 suffers little\ncatastrophic forgetting, as they have campaign-specific parameters\nor prompts (they are unaffected by continual learning as their base\nmodel is unchanged), although their performance is only marginally\nabove random chance in the first place. MetaTroll is the clear winner\nhere, with only <5% accuracy degradation over time.23 In contrast,\nthe meta-learning methods and few-shot classifiers suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting and their performance on older campaigns\ndrops substantially (e.g. MAML’s performance for GRU-2020-NATO\ndrops from 68.32 to 65.15 and 57.62 after several updates).\nAn unintended benefit of that MetaTroll classifies trolls using\nmultiple adapters is that it is effectively doing multi-class rather\nthan binary classification (with over 85% accuracy for campaign\nclassification; Table 4). What this means is that not only MetaTroll\nis able to retain its performance for classifying trolls vs. non-trolls\nfrom different campaigns over time, it can also predict which cam-\npaign an instance belongs to – an arguably more difficult task.\n5.4 Multilingual performance\nWe extend MetaTroll to multilingual. To encode multilingual input\ntext, we replace BERT with XLM-R [9].24 For comparison, we in-\nclude baselines BERT, KNN, and AdBERT, and meta-learning meth-\nods ProtoNet and MAML as their base model can be replaced with\nXLM-R. We exclude the few-shot classifiers as they are designed\nfor English and cannot be trivially adapted to other languages.\n21GPT3 technically does not have campaign-specific parameters, but it needs to be\ngiven campaign-specific prompts, and so requires the campaign label.\n22We do the same for AdBERT and GPT3.\n23Note that performance of these systems on older campaigns will still degrade slightly\nover more adaptations, as there are more campaign-specific adapters or prompts to\nselect from.\n24Specifically, we use the following library that implements adapters into XLM-R:\nhttps://docs.adapterhub.ml/classes/models/xlmroberta.html\nWWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA Lin Tian, Xiuzhen Zhang, and Jey Han Lau\nTable 5: Statistics of Multilingual meta-test data.

Generally we see that all models’\nperformance has somewhat degraded when their feature extractor\nis replaced with a multilingual model, although MetaTroll manages\nto keep its accuracy around 60%. Interestingly, China-2021-Changyu\nappears to be the most difficult campaign, and we suspect it may\nbe due to its diverse set of languages (38% French, 12.3% English,\n12.1% Simplified Chinese).\n5.5 Multimodal performance\nNext we consider incorporating images posted by users, as image is\nan effective communication device (e.g. memes). Note that we only\npresent results for different variants of MetaTroll here, as we have\ndemonstrated that it is the most competitive detection system.\nTo process images, we use pre-trained ResNet18 [18] as an off-\nthe-shelf tool to extract image embeddings. We also explore using\na multilingual OCR model to extract text information from images\n(which will be useful for processing memes).25 As we have multiple\nimages for each user, we aggregate the ResNet18 image embeddings\nvia max-pooling, and concatenate the max-pooled vector with the\ntext representation (𝑣 in Equation 3). For texts that are extracted\nby OCR, we concatenate them into a long string and process them\nwith another AdapterBERT (Equation 3; their parameters are not\nshared), and similarly concatenate the final CLS representation to\nthe text representation.\nResults are in Table 7. “+image#” is a baseline where we concate-\nnate a numeric feature that denotes the number of images posted\nby the user to the text representation. Interestingly, even with the\nbaseline approach we see a small improvement, indicating that\ntrolls use more images (e.g. average number of images used by\ntrolls is 20 vs. 5 for non-trolls in GRU-2020-NATO). Incorporating\neither ResNet or OCR encodings boosts performance further (with\nOCR being marginally more beneficial), and that adding them both\nproduces the best performance.\n6 CONCLUSION\nWe propose MetaTroll, a few-shot troll detection model with campaign-\nspecific adapters that tackles catastrophic forgetting in a continual\nlearning setting. Experimental results show that MetaTroll out-\nperforms existing state-of-the-art meta-learning and few-shot text\nclassification models, and it can be extended to handle multilingual\nand multimodal input.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research is supported in part by the Australian Research Coun-\ncil Discovery Project DP200101441.

The adapter-\nbased models are from AdapterHub29.\nTo handle images, we use ResNet18 30 and EasyOCR 31.\nWe set maximum token length = 320 and dropout rate = 0.2 for\nBERT embedding and dropout rate = 0.1 for meta-learning process.\nLearning rate is tuned in the range between [1𝑒−5,5𝑒−5]for BERT\nin the first stage. Learning rate warmup is set up 10% of steps. The\nlearning rate 𝛽for MAML outer loop is1𝑒−5. In the first stage, BERT\nuses the Adam optimiser [22]. Search space for learning rate𝛾and 𝛿\nis from [1𝑒−4,1𝑒−5,2𝑒−5,3𝑒−5,4𝑒−5,5𝑒−5]. The outer loop learning\nrate for the third stage 𝛿 is set as 1𝑒−5. The inner loop learning\nrate 𝛾 for BERT-based models is set as 2𝑒−5 and for XLM-R-based\nmodels is set as5𝑒−5. We experimented with the number of training\ntasks in the range of 60,000 to 100,000, with 80,000 tasks generally\nyielding the best results. Our experiments are running using A100\nGPU with 40GB Memory.\nB ABLATION STUDY\nWe conduct ablation study to justify the importance of our three\nstages training processes. By removing the adaptive classifier, we\nattach a standard linear layer for the final classification. For “s1+s2”,\nwe attach a standard linear layer for the final classification with\nremoving the adaptive classifier. “s2+s3” is initialise the BERT text\nencoder without pre-training on any troll data. “s1+s3” drops the\nmeta-trained task-specific adapter. We still allocate one adapter to\neach task with randomly initialised adaptor. We report the average\naccuracy on four English meta-testing campaigns of different model\nvariants in Table 8. Results show that our model, the combination\nof all three training stages achieves the best average accuracy of\n76.35%. Without pretraining the base text encoder, the framework\nperforms the worst, resulting in 3.04% drops on average accuracy.\nTable 8: Ablation results.\nVariants G I U C\ns1 + s2 71.35 75.02 72.47 80.03\nS1 + s3 72.43 74.81 72.25 79.55\ns2 + s3 71.25 75.19 73.50 78.33\nMetaTroll 72.74 76.25 75.05 81.37\nC DATASET DETAILS\nWe further include a detailed statistics of our Twitter troll data with\ndetailed topic for each campaign and online post link attached.\n26https://github.com/huggingface\n27https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased\n28https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base\n29urlhttps://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers\n30https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.h\ntml\n31https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR\nMetaTroll: Few-shot Detection of State-Sponsored Trolls with Transformer Adapters WWW ’23, May 1–5, 2023, Austin, TX, USA\nTable 9: Statistics of Twitter data for troll and non-troll accounts.
