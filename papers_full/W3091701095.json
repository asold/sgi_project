INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers are important devices for electrical\nenergy conversion and transmission. Their health status is\nrelated to the reliability of electric distribution systems.\nIn recent years, many techniques have been developed to\ndetermine the condition of transformers, including frequency\nresponse analysis, short-circuit impedance measurement, and\ndissolved gas analysis [1], [2]. The winding structure is\nmore prone to the risk of damage due to an overload cur-\nrent impulse, and its condition is critical to a transformer’s\noperational lifetime [3]. The winding clamping pressure is an\nimportant factor affecting the short-circuit strength of a power\ntransformer [4]. Increased concerns about fault detection and\ndiagnosis efﬁciency in a smart-grid context have motivated\nresearch into developing online non-intrusive monitoring\ntechniques [5]. Previous studies have shown that transformer\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Arpan Kumar Pradhan\n.\nvibration is connected with the mechanical properties of\nwindings, and the vibration technique has been used to\nprovide diagnostic information [6]–[9].\nThe mathematical model of transformer windings, known\nas the static winding model, has been well studied in past\ndecades. In the 1970s, Swihart et al.used a multiple lumped\nspring-mass system to represent the axial vibration of trans-\nformer windings, and investigated the dynamic stress-strain\ncharacteristics of insulations in detail [10]. With the develop-\nment of computer technologies, ﬁnite-element models were\nused to obtain a more accurate and intuitive result [11].\nIn the static winding model, the structural parameters of the\nwindings are independent of load, which can be obtained\nby the free vibration test. Geng et al. extracted the modal\nparameters of windings from the experimental data by using\nan improved empirical mode decomposition technique [12].\nSimilarly, Hong et al. decomposed the transient response\nsignal into single-frequency modes using variational mode\ndecomposition, and evaluated the damping properties by\nVOLUME 8, 2020\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.\nFor more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ 178685\nK. Honget al.: Transformer Condition Monitoring Based on Load-Varied Vibration Response and GRU Neural Networks\nidentifying the decay pattern [13]. For transformers in power\nstations, it was found that the transient vibration acquired\nduring the de-energizing process also contained structural\ninformation of the windings [8]. These results suggest the\npotential for diagnosing transformer windings by detecting\nthe change of modal parameters.\nAn operating transformer’s windings are affected by elec-\ntromagnetic force, and their structural parameters should be\ndifferent from those of static windings because of the non-\nlinear properties of insulations. For a normal winding, coil\nmovement in the axial direction is restricted by the clamping\ndevice. On one hand, an operating winding is almost equiv-\nalent to a static winding when the clamping force is much\nlarger than the electromagnetic force. On the other hand, the\nelectromagnetic force will change the axial force distribution\nof the winding under a low clamping force. It is important to\nunderstand the dynamic characteristics of an on-load winding\nfor transformer diagnosis. However, it is very dangerous to\nperform a free vibration test on a winding during operation.\nIn this study, free vibration tests were conducted on a small-\nsize winding model to explore the effects of electromagnetic\nforce on modal parameters under a safety voltage.\nThe steady-state vibration of a power transformer can be\nregarded as a response subjected to harmonic excitation,\nwhich often has components at 100 Hz and its harmonic\nfrequencies [14]. This is also the reason why it is difﬁcult\nto extract the structure information from the vibration sig-\nnals. Note that the transformers selected in this study are all\nworking at 50 Hz grid frequency. The vibration at 100 Hz\nis commonly explained as the combined contribution from\nthe magnetostrictive force and the electromagnetic force. The\nformer is proportional to the quadratics of the magnetic ﬂux\nin the core, while the latter is proportional to the square of\nthe current in the windings. As the applied voltage is usu-\nally a suitably regulated sinusoidal signal at 50 Hz, the ﬂux\nand current in idealized transformers are proportional to the\ninput voltage. Because practical transformers have nonlinear\nhysteresis between the excitation current and the magnetic\nﬂux within the core, the magnetostrictive force also contains\nother harmonics of 100 Hz. Ji et al.presented the relationship\nbetween the 100 Hz component and the electrical parame-\nters [15]. García et al.proposed an improved 100 Hz vibration\nmodel, which not only includes current and voltage, but also\ncontains oil temperature and a power factor [16]. We found\nthat the correlation between the 100 Hz vibration of differ-\nent locations contains diagnostic information of the wind-\nings [17]. Recently, Zhang et al.investigated the applicability\nof operational modal analysis to extract the modal parameters\nof windings from operating transformers [18], however, the\neffectiveness of digital ﬁlters needs to be further veriﬁed.\nThe features and changes in the harmonic components\nof transformer vibration are necessary to identify pos-\nsible changes in the mechanical properties of a trans-\nformer. Bartoletti et al.proposed a low-frequency parameter\nnamed the weighted total harmonic distortion to distinguish\nbetween normal and anomalous transformers [19]. Similarly,\nwe proposed several signal-based parameters [20], including\nthe frequency complexity analysis based on information\nentropy and vibration stationarity analysis based on a recur-\nrence plot [21]. It was showed statistically that anomalous\ntransformers have unpredictable high-frequency vibration\ncomponents. Recently, advanced signal processing methods,\nsuch as empirical wavelet transform, have been used to\ndiscover the non-stationary components of the vibrations\ncollected from anomalous transformers [22]. In this study,\nwe focus on the relationship between the steady-state vibra-\ntion response of windings and the load. During the process of\ntransformer condition monitoring, the vibration and current\nsignals usually appear in the form of time series. Therefore,\na gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is adopted to\nexplore the change in vibration amplitude with load for in-\nservice transformers.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Section II, the\nrelationship between natural frequency change and load is\ninvestigated after the winding vibration model is introduced,\nand a GRU-based sequence model is developed by taking\ninto account the effect of load current on harmonic response.\nThen, the frequency responses of a winding model under dif-\nferent clamping forces and loads are simulated in Section III.\nLaboratory experiments are carried out to verify the simulated\nresults in Section IV . In Section V , the feasibility and efﬁ-\nciency of the proposed ﬁeld application scheme are validated\nthrough analysis of typical in-service transformers. Finally,\nconclusions are drawn in Section VI.\nII. THEORY\nA. VIBRATION MODEL OF AN OPERATING WINDING\nA typical winding structure of an oil-immersed high-voltage\ntransformer is shown in Fig. 1. It comprises a stack\nof disk-type coils. The disks are composed of conduc-\ntor strips insulated with kraft paper, and are separated by\nequally spaced pressboards. In the equivalent multi-degree-\nof-freedom (MDOF) model, m stands for the mass of each\ncoil, and the insulation materials including pressboard and\nkraft paper are represented by a combination of stiffness (k )\nand damping (c). The above three parameters are considered\nto be the structural parameters in this study. In addition, fi and\nxi represent the electromagnetic force and displacement of\nthe i-th coil, respectively. The whole winding unit is clamped\nbetween the top and bottom clamping beams. The motion of\nthe bottom clamp is constrained, and the top clamp provides\na constant axial clamping force.\nUnder the assumption that the core and frame are relatively\nstiff, the axial winding vibration model can be described:\nM{¨x}+C{˙x}+K{x}={f }, (1)\nwhere M, C, and K represent the mass, damping, and stiffness\nmatrices, respectively, and {x } and {f } are the displacement\nand force vector, respectively. The induced electromagnetic\nforce on each coil is proportional to the current squared,\n178686 VOLUME 8, 2020\nK. Honget al.: Transformer Condition Monitoring Based on Load-Varied Vibration Response and GRU Neural Networks\nFIGURE 1. Simplified mathematical model of windings.\nwhich can be denoted as:\nfi(t) =Fi[1 −cos(2ωt)], Fi ∝I2, (2)\nwhere I and ω are the rated value and frequency of the\ncurrent. Fi is the force amplitude of the i-th coil, which can\nbe obtained via static electromagnetic analysis. The function\nfi consists of a DC part and an AC part, where the DC part\nchanges the stress on the pressboard in the axial direction,\nwhile the AC part acts as an excitation force at frequency 2ω :\nfi =f DC\ni +f AC\ni , (3)\nThe stiffness coefﬁcient and stress-strain property of an\ninsulation block are expressed respectively as [23]:\nk =H dσ\ndε and σ =\n{\naε+bε3 (ε> 0)\n0 (ε ≤0), (4)\nwhere σ and εare stress and strain, respectively; a and b are\nmaterial-related constants; and H is a constant related to the\ncontact area and thickness of insulations. For a system with\ndamping less than critical, the natural frequency of the n-th\nmode is denoted as:\nωn =γn\n√\nk/m, (5)\nwhere γn is a constant. Next, the derivative of ωn with respect\nto σ is obtained as:\n1ωn\n1σ ≈dωn\ndσ =3γnH2bεk−3/2m1/2. (6)\nHere, a new parameter called the frequency shift rate (FSR)\nis deﬁned as:\nFSR(ωn) =1ωn\nωn\n≈λ·1σ,λ (σ)=3H2bεk−2m, (7)\nwhere λ is a parameter related to the clamping force for a\nspeciﬁed winding. Since the stress change is proportional to\nthe change of the current squared, FSR is only dependent on\nthe current change for the windings with the same clamping\nforce:\nFSR(ωn) ∝1(I2), (8)\nAccording to (4), the progressive loss of clamping force is\nreﬂected in the decrease of the equivalent stiffness. Therefore,\nthe winding conditions can be assessed in terms of axial\nforce distribution by evaluating the relationship between FSR\nand 1(I2).\nB. LOAD-VARIED STEADY-STATE VIBRATION\nThe harmonic components other than 100 Hz can be regarded\nas the responses of the winding structure under the magne-\ntostrictive force. Because the input voltage is approximately\nconstant for an in-service transformer, the magnetostrictive\nforce originating from the core can be treated as a stable\nharmonic excitation:\nf core =\n∑\nω\nFcore\nω sin ωt, (9)\nwhere ω should be an integral multiple of the fundamental\nfrequency (100 Hz). When the sinusoidal force at frequency ω\nis applied on each coil of the model shown in (1), the steady-\nstate response in the physical coordinates under the assump-\ntion that there is a little damping [24] is:\nxq(ω) =\nN∑\nn=1\nϕqnFcore\nω\n∑\nj\nϕjn\n∑\nj\nmjϕ2\njn\n· sin ωt\n(ω2n −ω2), (10)\nwhere N is the total number of degrees-of-freedom, xq is the\ndisplacement of the q-th coil, and ϕjn is the amplitude of the\nj-th degree of freedom in the n-th mode. Since all coils have\nthe same mass for a winding, the following is satisﬁed when\nnormal modes are used:\n∑\nj\nmjϕ2\njn =1. (11)\nIt stands to reason that the maximum amplitude appears\nwhen the excitation frequency is close to a certain natural\nfrequency. For a system with no closely spaced modes, it is\nassumed that the amplitude peak at frequency ω is only\ndominated by the nearest n′-th mode (ω ≈ ωn′), and the\namplitude of the q-th coil in terms of acceleration is:\nAq(ω) ≈µqn′\nω2\n(ω2 −ω2\nn′),µqn′ =Fcore\nω ϕqn′\n∑\nj\nϕjn′, (12)\nwhere µqn′is a constant coefﬁcient related to the location,\nmode shape, and magnetostrictive force. Note that Aq may\nhave a negative value. Next, the amplitude change due to the\nnatural frequency change is obtained as:\n1Aq\n1ωn′\n≈ dAq\ndωn′\n=µqn′\n2ω2ωn′\n(ω2 −ω2\nn′)2 . (13)\nBased on (12) and (13), the FSR value of an operating\nwinding can be estimated by:\nFSR(ωn′) =1ωn′\nωn′\n≈µqn′\n2\n1Aq(ω)\nA2q(ω) . (14)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 178687\nK. Honget al.: Transformer Condition Monitoring Based on Load-Varied Vibration Response and GRU Neural Networks\nSubstituting (7) into (14), the relationship between the\namplitude change and the stress change is:\n1Aq(ω)\nA2q(ω) ≈ 2λ\nµqn′\n1σ. (15)\nFor an operating transformer, the vibration samples under\ndifferent loads can be acquired, and a new parameter SAC is\nused to represent the sum of the amplitude change between\nany two samples:\nSAC = 1\nNω\n∑\nω\n1Aq(ω)\nA2q(ω) ∝1(I2), (16)\nwhere Nω is the number of selected harmonic components.\nCompared with FSR, it is shown that SAC is also proportional\nto the change of current squared. However, the relationship\nbetween them not only reﬂects the winding clamping state,\nbut also contains the information of the magnetostrictive\nforce, mode shape, and sensor location. In ﬁeld applications,\nSAC can be approximately used to assess the clamping state\nbased on the following assumptions. First, f core has a similar\ndistribution function for all transformers. Second, the matrix\nK varies with the clamping force proportionately because the\npressure on each pressboard changes synchronously, which\nresults in unaffected mode shapes when the corresponding\nnatural frequency changes, and it is assumed that all domi-\nnated modes are covered when enough harmonic peaks are\ntaken into account. Third, the vibration sensors are arranged\nat the same or symmetrical locations on the tank during the\nmeasurement.\nC. GRU-BASED MODEL IN FIELD APPLICATIONS\nIn ﬁeld applications, six accelerometers are arranged on one\nside of the three-phase transformer tank, whose locations are\nillustrated in Fig. 2. The sensors in one column are related to\none winding structure, whose positions are symmetrical with\nrespect to the winding center. In addition, the sensor location\nshould close to the winding end which is subjected to the\nlargest axial electromagnetic force. The vibration and current\nsignals are acquired synchronously at 10 kHz. Our measure-\nment system records one second of data every minute, and the\nmeasurement continues for more than 24 hours to cover the\nentire load range.\nThe vibration acquired from the transformer tank is a\nmixed signal, and we focus on the harmonic components\nlarger than 100 Hz. Based on the aforementioned theory,\nthe vibration features of each location can be extracted by\nusing the procedures shown in Fig. 3. The time point number\nT depends on the sampling interval. If the interval is set to\none hour, then T is 24 for a one-day period. According to\nthe requirement of (12), the absolute value of the selected\npeak should be larger than the threshold which is 0.2 times the\nroot mean square of the vibration series. Vi and Ii represent\nthe vibration series and current RMS at time index i, respec-\ntively. Note that Ii should be normalized by dividing its rated\nvalue ﬁrst. According to (16), the SAC sequence is derived\nfrom the vibration sequence, and each element in the force\nFIGURE 2. Sensor arrangement in the field applications.\nFIGURE 3. Flowchart of the GRU-based sequence model.\nchange sequence {1F t } equals to the change of the current\nsquared.\nIn this study, a GRU network is used to establish the rela-\ntionship between SAC sequence and force sequence. Accord-\ning to (16), the GRU network is sufﬁcient to interpret the\nlinear relationship, which also has the ability to capture non-\nlinear patterns. In addition, the GRU network is a kind of\nimproved recurrent neural networks, which aims to solve the\nvanishing gradient problem. The GRU cell is also illustrated\nin Fig. 3, and Eqs. (17)–(20) summarizes how to calculate the\ncell state:\nzt =Sigmoid(Wz ·[ht−1,1F t ]), (17)\nrt =Sigmoid(Wr ·[ht−1,1F t ]), (18)\nh′\nt =tanh (W ·[rt ∗ht−1,1F t ]), (19)\nht =zt ∗h′\nt +(1 −zt )∗ht−1, (20)\nwhere rt and zt are reset gate and update gate, respec-\ntively. W , Wr and Wz are weight matrices. Because\nthe load variation trend of each transformer is differ-\nent, we introduce a method refers to the ‘‘learn and pre-\ndict’’ procedure. First, the GRU network is trained by\nusing the monitoring data. After that, the obtained GRU\ncell contains the sequence information. Then, the SAC\nsequence can be predicted by giving an arbitrary force\nsequence.\n178688 VOLUME 8, 2020\nK. Honget al.: Transformer Condition Monitoring Based on Load-Varied Vibration Response and GRU Neural Networks\nFIGURE 4. FE model based on the experimental winding.\nTABLE 1. Specifications of the winding model.\nIII. FINITE-ELEMENT SIMULATION\nIn this section, a ﬁnite-element (FE) model of the experi-\nmental winding structure is established using the software\nAbaqus. The 10 kV A single-phase winding and the corre-\nsponding FE model are illustrated in Fig. 4, and its parameters\nare given in Table 1. In the model, the degree of freedom of\nthe bottom nodes is deﬁned as zero because of the constraint\nboundary condition, and the pressure is applied on the top.\nThe frequency response functions of each coil under different\nclamping forces are obtained in the simulation, and we focus\non the effect of electromagnetic force on vibration responses.\nThe stress-strain property of the pressboard is obtained\nfrom compression and decompression measurements, which\nare depicted in Fig. 5. In the FE model, the hysteresis phe-\nnomenon is ignored, and the mean value is used instead. The\nelectromagnetic force distribution can be obtained by estab-\nlishing a 2-D axisymmetric model in ANSYS [9]. The axial\nelectromagnetic force amplitude deﬁned in (2) is obtained\nwhen the input current is 75 A, which is shown in Fig. 6.\nIn order to make the results more visible, the input current is\nthree times as large as the rated value. Because the maximum\naxial electromagnetic force always appears at the winding\nend, P1, P12, and P24 are selected as typical points.\nA frequency response function (FRF) is a mathematical\nrepresentation of the relationship between the input force\nand the measured vibration at a particular point. Note that\nthe excitation force is applied to the top clamp in both\nsimulation and experiment. For a clamping force (CF) of\n2.4 MPa, the FRFs under different loads are compared in\nFig. 7. Similarly, the FRFs under 0.2 MPa are compared\nFIGURE 5. Stress–strain curves of the pressboard.\nFIGURE 6. Electromagnetic force distribution at maximum current.\nin Fig. 8. It can be seen that the electromagnetic force pro-\nduced by the current is insufﬁcient to change the structural\nparameters of the windings when the clamping force is large\nenough. By comparison, the electromagnetic force will cause\nthe natural frequency of the structure to move to higher\nfrequencies when the clamping force is 0.2 MPa. Similar\nmovement patterns are observed in all the coils.\nAccording to (7), FSR is only related to the stress change.\nTaking P1 as an example, the relationship between FSR and\nnatural frequency is shown in Fig. 9, which is obtained by cal-\nculating the peak movement between the FRF curves under\n0 A and 75 A. It is shown that the FSR value is independent\nof frequency, and the average FSR value is used instead in the\nremainder of this paper.\nFor P1, the relationship between FSR and current is plotted\nin Fig. 10. It can be seen that the FSR value is proportional\nto the current squared. According to (7), the slope of the line\ncontains the structural information of the windings, which is\nalso deﬁned as FSRR =FSR /I2. The FSRR values of three\nVOLUME 8, 2020 178689\nK.

Comparison of FRF curves for the loose windings.\ntypical points under different clamping forces are depicted\nin Fig. 11. It can be seen that all points have the same trend,\nso FSRR can be treated as a location-independent structural\nindex.\nIV. LABORATORY EXPERIMENT\nDuring the laboratory experiment, free vibration tests were\nconducted on an on-load winding unit whose parameters are\nthe same as those given in Table 1. The clamping force of\nthe winding was adjusted by tightening the bolt to a speciﬁed\ntorque, and the torque value was ﬁnally converted to the pres-\nsure on the pressboard. The accelerometers (Model 356A03)\nwere glued on the coil, and the vibrations from P1, P12, and\nP24 were analyzed in detail. The integrated system B&K\n3560C with PULSE software was used to acquire vibration\ndata and calculate FRFs. During the experiment, the low-\nvoltage terminals of the windings were short-circuited, and\nthe high-voltage terminals were connected to the AC voltage\nregulator. Unlike in the FE simulation, the current was limited\nFIGURE 9. FSR values under different clamping forces.\nFIGURE 10.

The\ncurrent was increased gradually by adjusting the voltage.\nWhen the current reached the desired value, the transient\nvibration responses in the axial direction and related FRFs\nwere obtained when the winding top was hit by an impact\nhammer (B&K 8206).\nThe FRF curves of three typical points under 2.0 MPa and\n0.1 MPa are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14, respectively. Due\nto the small size of the experimental windings, the effect of\nthe load current on the low-frequency FRFs is not signiﬁcant.\nWhen the clamping force is large enough, the load current\nhardly affects the natural frequency of the windings. By com-\nparison, the peaks in the FRF curves shift to higher frequen-\ncies when the current increases for the loose windings. These\nresults are consistent with the simulation results. Based on the\nFRFs, the natural frequencies of the system can be extracted\nby locating the peaks, which are compared in Table 2.\n178690 VOLUME 8, 2020\nK.

Single-phase model in the laboratory experiment.\nTABLE 2. Comparison of the identified natural frequencies.\nBased on the identiﬁed natural frequencies, the FSRR val-\nues are calculated by taking into account the peak movement\nand the current change. We still regard 75 A as a 100% value,\nwhich is consistent with the simulation results. Fig. 15 shows\nthe FSRR values at different frequencies, and the averaged\nvalues under different clamping forces are also compared.\nThe FSRR value increases rapidly with the decreasing clamp-\ning force when the clamping force is less than 0.5 MPa. Refer-\nring to the simulated curve shown in Fig. 11, the estimated\nFIGURE 13. FRF curves under standard clamping force.\nFIGURE 14. FRF curves under low clamping force.\nclamping force can be derived from the FSRR value, which is\nclose to the real value.\nAt the end of this section, we would like to discuss an\ninteresting phenomenon. The pressboard at the top may lose\ncontact with the coils when the clamping force drops to a\nlow level. Because the direction of the electromagnetic force\non the top coil is downward, the looseness becomes more\nsevere when the current increases, and the quick reduction\nof the stiffness of pressboard will decrease the natural fre-\nquency. Fig. 16 shows that the FRF curve moves toward low\nfrequency as the current increases when the clamping force\nis less than 0.1 MPa, which is opposite to the result shown\nin Fig. 14.\nV. FIELD APPLICATIONS\nAccording to [4], shrinkage and fading of the stiffness of\nsolid insulation due to thermal degradation are the most com-\nmon causes of the clamp looseness. So the clamping force\nadjustment experiment offers a reference for the study of the\nVOLUME 8, 2020 178691\nK.

In this section, two typ-\nical transformers, including a normal sample and a degraded\nsample, are selected to demonstrate the applications of the\nproposed method. Both transformers have a primary voltage\nclass of 110 kV , which means their winding structures are\nsimilar. The change in short-circuit impedance (SCI) between\nthe measured value and the original (factory) value is used as\nthe criterion to distinguish between normal transformer and\ndegraded transformer. The normal sample has a change in\nSCI of below 0.5%, while the degraded sample is selected\nfrom the aged transformers with changes in SCI between 1%\nand 3% [2]. In this study, we did not choose the anomalous\ntransformers for the reason that they cannot withstand high\nloads.\nThe vibrations were acquired from the transformers\naccording to the procedure introduced in Section II. Typical\nvibrations from the normal transformer and the degraded\ntransformer are shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, respectively.\nBecause the steady-state vibration has obvious periodicity,\nFourier transform is sufﬁcient for harmonic analysis. Point 1,\nFIGURE 17. Vibrations of the normal transformer in the time and\nfrequency domains.\nFIGURE 18. Vibrations of the degraded transformer in the time and\nfrequency domains.\nPoint 3, and Point 5 are located close to the winding top,\nand their vibrations in the time domain and frequency domain\nare both plotted in the ﬁgure. The amplitude and distribution\nof the harmonic components have the characteristics of ran-\ndomness. So it is difﬁcult to distinguish the degraded sample\nfrom the normal sample through the analysis of short-time\nvibrations.\nFollowing the ﬂowchart shown in Fig. 3, the SAC and\nforce sequences can be obtained. Before the application of\nGRU networks, the scatter plots of the normal transformer\nare shown in Fig. 19. Note that the discrete points are obtained\nfrom the vibration monitoring data by adjusting the time inter-\nval. The red lines are obtained using the least-squares method,\nand should pass through the origin point. The drawback of the\ntraditional linear regression method is that a large number of\npoints are needed to obtain better ﬁtting results. In addition,\nthe nonlinear information will be lost if the linear regression\nis used.\n178692 VOLUME 8, 2020\nK.

Relationship between SAC and force sequences for the\nnormal transformer.\nFIGURE 20. Predicted SAC curves for the typical transformers: (a) normal\nsample, (b) degraded sample.\nFinally, the proposed ‘‘learn and predict’’ procedure is\napplied to the selected typical transformers, and the predicted\nrelationship between SAC sequence and force sequence is\nshown in Fig. 20. The GRU network is realized by using\ngruLayer in MATLAB. In this study, the time interval of the\nsequence is one hour, and the single-element force sequence\nfrom -0.2 to 0.2 is used to predict the SAC values after the\nGRU network is trained by the monitoring data. Compared\nwith the ﬁtted lines in Fig. 19, it is proved that the GRU net-\nwork can capture the linear relationship accurately. In Fig. 20,\nthe curve slope for the degraded transformer is larger than that\nfor the normal transformer. According to (15), the curve slope\nreﬂects the clamping force on the pressboard, which can be\nused as a health index for winding condition assessment.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nResearch on the effect of load current on the vibration\nresponse of windings is of great importance for the diagnosis\nof in-service transformers. Based on the nonlinear stress–\nstrain property of the insulations, the frequency responses\nof a single-phase winding under different loads were simu-\nlated. The electromagnetic force produced by the load cur-\nrent is insufﬁcient to change the structural parameters of\nwell-clamped windings. In contrast, an increased current will\ncause the natural frequency of the windings to move to\nhigher frequencies when the clamping force is low. In the\nlaboratory experiment, free vibration tests were conducted\non an on-load winding structure, and the results agreed with\nthose obtained in the ﬁnite-element simulation. The ratio of\nnatural frequency change to current squared was found to\nbe a good indicator of clamping force. In the ﬁeld applica-\ntions, the GRU-based ‘‘learn and predict’’ procedure is pro-\nposed, which can be used to capture the relationship between\nthe vibration change and the corresponding current change.\nIt was shown that the change of harmonic amplitude with\nload current contains the structural information of windings,\nwhich can be used to distinguish normal transformers from\ndegraded transformers. In summary, transformer condition\nmonitoring using vibration methods should not be limited\nto analyzing a single time vibration segment, but should\nalso grasp the diagnostic information from the load-varying\nvibration trend.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
