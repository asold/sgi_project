The current review gives an overview of the recent find-\nings concerning transdifferentiation by only small-molecules without the use of transgenes.\nKeywords: Small-molecule, Cellular reprogramming, Transdifferentiation, Regenerative medicine\nIntroduction \n  From decades ago, it has been known that cell fate de-\ntermination is reversible (1, 2). After the advent of in-\nduced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology (3-5), this \ntopic has attracted considerable attention, leading to the \ntremendous advancement of the reprogramming arena. \nDirect lineage conversion or transdifferentiation can be \ninduced by the forced expression of lineage-specific tran-\nscription factors, bypassing pluripotent state and its asso-\nciated risks (6). Notably, to describe conversion of a termi-\nnally differentiated cell type into another, different terms \nare used for the same concept, including direct reprogram-\nming, direct lineage conversion or transdifferentiation. \n  Reprogramming techniques conventionally use viral vec-\ntors encoding transcription factors to induce fate con-\nversion (6, 7). However, the use of genetic materials in di-\nrect reprogramming methods is associated with safety-re-\nlated concerns due to the introduction of exogenous DNA \nin the host genome. This limits potential clinical applica-\ntions of direct reprogramming strategy and its products \n(6). Reducing the number of transcription factors or their \nomission has been investigated to increase the feasibility \nof reprogramming methods and safety of the generated \ncells (6, 8, 9). Therefore, developing strategies that avoid \ngenetic manipulations is more desirable. Various non-in-\ntegrating techniques have been developed to overcome \nsafety-related concerns (10-15). Among different integra-\n10  International Journal of Stem Cells 2016;9:9-20\ntion-free techniques, direct reprogramming by using \nsmall-molecules (chemical reprogramming) might have \nsome advantageous over other methods. Chemical strategy \ndisplays promise for manipulation of cell fate because \nsmall-molecules are cell permeable, cost-effective, easy to \nuse, non-integrative, and their effects are reversible. Thus, \nchemicals can be considered as an alternative to tran-\nscription factors because they are non-immunogenic and \neasy to manipulate and standardize (16-19).\n  Small-molecules have been used to promote differ-\nentiation and to facilitate direct reprogramming (9, 20). \nRecently, different groups independently demonstrated \nthe dispensability of transgenic reprogramming factors in \ncell fate conversion between two differentiated cell types \nusing small-molecules alone (19, 21-31). Chemical cock-\ntails have been successful in conversion of somatic cells \ninto induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (25, 28-30), \ncardiomyocyte (27), endothelial cells (24), neural progeni-\ntor cells (NPCs) (21), or neurons (19, 22, 31). Therefore, \nchemical reprogramming is a new paradigm for studying \ncell fate conversion. \n  Transdifferentiation using a chemical-only approach \ncan be a safe and efficient method for the production of \nclinically relevant cell types while avoids the pluripotent \nstate and hurdles of iPSC generation and subsequent \ndifferentiation. It also bypasses safety issues intrinsic to \nthe use of viral vectors. These findings alleviate major \ntechnical and safety concerns raised by the forced ex-\npression of transgenes and can lead to the generation of \nsafer cells, which are more a ppropriate for regenerative \npurposes, disease modeling, and drug discovery (16, 17).\n  There are a substantial amount of papers that have dealt \nwith the role of small-molecules in reprogramming, trans-\ndifferentiation and differentiation (17, 18, 32, 33). The \ncurrent review discusses chemical-only transdifferentiation. \nHowever, it should be noted that this is a new and grow-\ning topic in the field and there have been published few \nreports to date. Thus, more investigation is required to \nconfirm current findings and to demonstrate the ability \nof chemical-only transdifferentiation for the generation of \nvarious cell types. Special modifications in the compo-\nnents of chemical cocktails may yield additional lineages \nin future (34). Collectively, current findings in chemical \nreprogramming approach provide a key starting point for \nthe generation of relevant cell types and subtypes and \ntheir translational utility.\nChemical-only transdifferentiation \n  Chemical reprogramming was first demonstrated by \nDeng and colleagues in the generation of chemical-in-\nduced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) in 2013. They \nshowed that a cocktail of seven small-molecules repro-\ngrams mouse somatic cells into CiPSCs (25). This finding \nintroduced a safe route for the generation of other cell \ntypes without introducing exogenous factors.\n  Small-molecule-mediated transdifferentiation is a new \narena of the reprogramming technology. As indicated in \nTable 1, hitherto, there are few reports of chemical trans-\ndifferentiation and a limited number of cell types have \nbeen reprogrammed using this approach. However, it is \nan exciting and growing field of research and in the near \nfuture more cell types will be chemically reprogrammed. \nMoreover, current fate conversions have been accom-\nplished empirically and the underlying mechanisms of \nthese chemical reprogramming approaches remain to be \ninvestigated. Elucidating the molecular events that under-\nlie the trajectory of chemical transdifferentiation can as-\nsist the improvement of the process and the generation of \nvarious cell types. Interestingly, although thousands of \nsmall-molecules have been screened, small-molecules with \nknown function in differentiation have been identified \nto be capable of induction of transdifferentiation (19). \nTherefore, expanding our knowledge of underlying mecha-\nnisms of development, differentiation and reprogramming \ncould assist identification of other small-molecule cock-\ntails appropriate for the production of various cell types. \nMoreover, these findings may suggest an unexpected state \nof plasticity for somatic cells and indicate that the identity \nof somatic cells is rather flexible than previously thought. \nThis paper discusses chemical-only transdifferentiation of \nsomatic cells into neurons (19, 22, 26) and neural progeni-\ntor cells (21). Moreover, it briefly reviews single reports \nof chemical-only transdifferentiation toward pancreatic \n(23), endothelial (24) and cardiomyocyte (27) fates. Of \nnote, these fate conversions are single pioneer reports and \nthe reproducibility of the protocols has yet to be unan-\nimously confirmed in different settings.\n  Chemical transdifferentiation approaches have been \ndone at least in two steps, including an induction step and \na maturation step (19, 22). Furthermore, fate conversion \nin some of the chemical protocols goes through a transient \nintermediate state (Fig. 1) (23, 24).\nChemical-only production of neural cells\n  Three Chinese groups have endeavored to induce neural \nreprogramming in human and mouse somatic cells using \nsmall-molecules alone (Fig. 1) (19, 21, 22, 26, 31).\n  Pei group in 2014 adopted a two steps strategy to con-\nBehnam Ebrahimi: Chemical-only Transdifferentiation  11\nTable 1.

Current progress in chemical-only transdifferentiation. A chemical cocktail induces the starting cells into an intermediate or immature \nstate. Then, the immature cells are converted into different mature and progenitor cells (e.g. neurons, neural progenitor cells, neuroblasts, \ncardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and pancreatic β-like cells) by small-molecules and growth factors in a stepwise manner. The intermediate \nstate in the figure is indicative of the induced cells that are immature. Upper part shows stepwise chemical-only transdifferen tiation of \nastrocytes into neuroblasts and neurons. Another paradigm is that the starting cells are directed toward a plastic state by specific chemicals\nand then they are differentiated into certain lineages by specific soluble signals (i.e. small-molecules and growth factors). \nvert mouse fibroblasts and human urinary cells into true \nneural progenitor cells (NPCs) under a physiological hy-\npoxic condition and without introducing exogenous fac-\ntors (21). They used a chemical cocktail, namely VCR \n(Valproic acid (VPA), CHIR99021, and Repsox) to induce \nneural reprogramming. The two major steps include in-\nduction of an initial transition state using VRC/hypoxia \nand then lineage specification using maturation signals. \nSmall-molecules VPA, CHIR99021 and Repsox are in-\nhibitors of HDACs, GSK-3 and TGF-β kinase pathways, \nrespectively (Table 1). Findings showed that inhibition of \nthese pathways by alternative inhibitors (Table 1) results \nin the same conversion process, indicating the important \nroles of these pathways in the successful transition of fi-\nbroblasts into NPCs (21). In their study, Cheng et al. used \nVCR, which are a part of CiPSC production cocktail (25, \n29) (Table 2) that may induce an intermediate unstable \nstage appropriate for induction of a progenitor state under \nlineage-specific conditions (21).\n  Most recently, Pei and colleagues in another work in-\ndicated that a cocktail of seven small-molecules, by combi-\nnatorial modulation of multiple signaling pathways, effi-\nciently converts human fibroblasts into functional neuro-\nnal cells without passing through a progenitor stage (22). \nIndeed, they promoted their previous protocol (VCR) (21) \nby the addition of chemicals known to promote neuronal \ndifferentiation of NPCs (22).\n  They found that addition of four small-molecules, in-\ncluding Forskolin (activator of adenylate cyclase, F), \nSP600125 (JNK inhibitor, S), GO6983 (PKC inhibitor, G) \nand Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, Y) to the VCR (collectively \nVCRFSGY) potently converts human fibroblasts into neu-\nronal cells (22). To improve neuronal cell survival and ma-\nturation, they replaced induction medium containing \nVCRFSGY with maturation medium containing CHIR99021 \n(C), Forskolin (F), and Dorsomorphin (D) and extra neu-\nrotropic factors (BDNF, GDNF, and NT3) (22) (Table 1). \nThe products of this induction system were mostly gluta-\nmatergic neurons. Possibly, modified chemical cocktails \nmay generate different neuronal subtypes (22). \n  Pei and colleagues showed that chemical-induced NPCs \n(ciNPCs) converted from mouse embryonic fibroblasts \n(MEFs) keep a degree of residual fibroblast epigenetic \nmemory (21), indicating the need for more robust proto-\ncols to be capable of erasure of the native program in this \nprogenitors. By contrast, they indicated that VCRFSGY \ninduction protocol effectively suppresses fibroblast-specific \ngenes and establishes an authentic neuronal identity (22). \n  Interestingly, this chemical approach generated human \nchemical-induced neuronal cells (hciNs) from familial \nAlzheimer’s disease patients (22). This finding shows the \ncapability of this chemical induction protocol for the gen-\neration of patient-specific neuronal cells that could be use-\nful for disease modeling and drug screening (22).\n  Recently, Li et al. demonstrated that a minimal set of \nfour small-molecules, including Forskolin, ISX9, CHIR99021 \nand I-BET151 (FICB) robustly converts mouse fibroblasts \ninto functional neurons (Table 1 and 2) with a yield of \nup to 90% (19). Indeed, this chemical cocktail induced re-\nprogramming via disruption of the fibroblast program us-\ning I-BET151 and induction of neuronal cell fate mostly \nby ISX9.

Moreover, \nit has been indicated that CiNs are directly reprogrammed \nfrom fibroblasts bypassing a transitional proliferative \nstage (Fig. 1) (19).\n  T h e  s t u d i e s  o f  H u  e t  a l .

In \nthese studies, CHIR99021 and Forskolin were common in \nboth cocktails, indicating the importance of GSK3 in-\nhibition and cyclic AMP stimulation in neuronal fate \nconversion.\n  Different assays (e.g. transcriptional profile, morpho-\nlogical, and electrophysiological properties), showed that \nCiNs produced by both cocktails are functional and sim-\nilar to the stem cell-derived neurons and transcription fac-\ntor-induced neurons (19, 22). Both groups indicated that \nmost of their CiNs are excitatory, glutamatergic neurons \nand that cholinergic or dopaminergic neurons were absent. \nBoth cocktails silenced the fibroblast program. Furthermore, \nboth studies indicated that fate conversions occurred di-\nrectly and no progenitor state was detected. Findings \nshowed that in both cocktails, small-molecules exerted \ntheir effects in a synergistic manner to do the neuronal \nconversion. These findings show that a well-designed \nchemical protocol can directly and efficiently convert \nmouse or human fibroblasts into functional neurons with-\nin few days.\n  Astrocytes are an ideal donor cell course for trans-\ndifferentiation into neurons. Astroglial cells have been di-\nrectly reprogrammed into functional neurons both in vitro \n(35, 36) and in vivo (35, 37-40) using the viral-based ex-\npression of transcription factors. In 2014, Chen and col-\nleagues showed that reactive glial cells can be directly con-\nverted into functional neurons in vivo by the transcription \nfactor, NeuroD1 (35). Most recently they reported that a \nsmall-molecule cocktail (LDN193189, SB431542, TTNPB, \nTzv, CHIR99021, VPA, DAPT, SAG, and Purmo) converts \nhuman astrocytes into fully functional neurons in vitro in \n8-10 days when administered in a stepwise manner (Table \n1) (Fig. 1) (26). For maturing astrocyte-converted neurons, \nthey used neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NT3, and IGF-1). \nMechanistically, this chemical reprogramming protocol \nepigenetically silenced glial genes and transcriptionally ac-\ntivated neuronal genes (e.g. NGN2 and NEUROD1) (26). \nInterestingly, chemically reprogrammed human neurons \ngenerated from astrocytes survived for ＞5 months in vitro \nand ＞1 month in the mouse brain in vivo  (26). This \nchemical astrocyte-neuron reprogramming strategy mostly \nresults in forebrain glutamatergic neurons as the major \nsubtype. Therefore, different small-molecules or different \nstrategies should be adopted for the generation of other \ntypes of neurons (26). \n  Pei and colleagues recently developed a chemical recipe \nthat can convert neonatal and adult mouse astrocytes into \nneuronal cells in vitro (Fig. 1) (31). They used their pre-\nvious VCR cocktail with slight modifications. They found \nthat VPA is sufficient to induce fate conversion, but with \nlower efficiency and that the efficiency of VR (VPA and \nRepsox) was similar to that of VCR. Similar results were \nobserved by replacement of Repsox with Tranilast (T, a \nTGF-β inhibitor and an antiallergic drug). These chem-\nical cocktails converted mouse astrocytes into DCX\n＋ neu-\nroblasts and Tuj1＋ or NeuN＋ neurons. Interestingly, the \nBehnam Ebrahimi: Chemical-only Transdifferentiation  15\nmature neurons converted from astrocytes were functional \nwith action potentials and postsynaptic currents. This \nfinding shows that chemicals are capable of driving trans-\ndifferentiation of mouse astrocytes into neurons in vitro \nthrough the activation of NeuroG2 and NeuroD1 ex-\npression (31). \n  Findings of Zhang et al. and Cheng et al. reveal that \nchemical approach can be a hope for the regeneration of \nneurons after brain injury. Indeed, these data offer the \nidea that the application of a chemical cocktail in situ can \nconvert resident astrocytes into neurons, which is the ulti-\nmate goal of regenerative medicine.\n  The findings of Zhang et al. showed that chemical in-\nhibition of BMP/TGFβ, Notch, and GSK3 β signaling \npathways is fundamental for reprogramming human as-\ntrocytes into neurons (26). Interestingly, aforementioned \nstudies showed that CHIR99021 (inhibitor of GSK3β) ap-\npears to be an indispensable small-molecule for chemical \nconversion of most of the somatic cells into neurons. By \ncontrast, Cheng et al. found that CHIR99021 is dis-\npensable for chemical-induced astrocyte-to-neuron con-\nversion in mouse cells.\n  Results revealed that different cell types have distinct \nrequirements for a specific fate conversion (19, 22, 26). \nIndeed, the type or origin of starting cells has a significant \nimpact on reprogramming process and its products (41, \n42). For example, an optimized protocol for conversion of \nhuman brain astrocytes into neurons has been unable to \nconvert human spinal cord astrocytes or mouse astrocytes, \nsuggesting specificity of this chemical reprogramming \nprotocol for astrocytes with human brain origin (26). \nTherefore, it could be concluded that a specific cell type \nwould respond to a specific set of small-molecules to un-\ndergo the intended fate conversion. Accordingly, different \nsets of chemicals should be optimized for the generation \nof different subtypes of neurons and possibly induction of \nregeneration in different neurological disorders. \n  Chen and colleagues used reprogramming chemicals in \na sequential manner due to the adverse effect of simulta-\nneous inhibition of some signaling pathways on cell sur-\nvival (26). These findings show that combinatorial modu-\nlation of multiple signaling pathways could have opposing \neffects on reprogramming process and its efficiency. \nMoreover, lessons from embryonic development suggest \nthat it would be better to adopt a stepwise strategy for \nchemical transdifferentiation.\n  Another point is that physiological hypoxia is a key \ncomponent of the niche of stem cells in vivo influencing \nproliferation and cell-fate commitment (43). Regarding \nthe role of hypoxia as a facilitator of neurons (31) and \nNPC chemical transdifferentiation (21), examining chem-\nical transdifferentiation protocols in low oxygen con-\nditions and importantly in vivo would be of great interest.\nChemical-only production of cardiomyocytes\n  Findings have shown that cardiomyocyte-like cells can \nbe generated by the forced expression of transcription fac-\ntors (44-46) or miRNAs (47) and that small-molecules can \nenable cardiac transdifferentiation of fibroblasts by Oct4 \nalone (48). Surprisingly, in an attempt to replicate mouse \nCiPSC production method using CRFVPT (i.e. CHIR99021, \nRepSox, Forskolin, VPA, Parnate, TTNPB) cocktail (25), \nFu et al. found infrequent beating cardiomyocytes instead \nof CiPSCs in their culture as early as days 6 ∼8 (Fig. 1) \n(27). Their two-stage optimization strategy showed that \nCRFV was the most critical cocktail for the induction of \nbeating clusters, with RepSox (R) as the most important \ninducing factor, while Parnate or TTNPB was found to \nbe dispensable (27). Moreover, small-molecules ICARIIN, \nPD169316 and Rolipram increased the efficiency of car-\ndiac reprogramming (27).\n  Why in this study Xie and colleagues achieved car-\ndiomyocytes (27) using CiPSCs generation protocol (25) \nis not fully known. This is while in their recent study (28) \nthey repeated successfully the chemical protocol of Hou \net al. (CiPSCs generation protocol) and enhanced the effi-\nciency of CiPSC generation. However, the subsequent cul-\nture condition appears to play a critical role in driving \nthe early intermediate cells toward iPSC or cardiomyocyte \nfates (27).\n  Results showed that chemical-mediated cardiac re-\nprogramming goes through a cardiac precursor-like stage \nbut not a pluripotent one and both atrial-like and ven-\ntricular-like cells were found in the culture. Fu et al. \nshowed that Sca1\n＋ cardiac precursor-like cells can be dif-\nferentiated into smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells \n(27). This indicates that specific cell sub-types could be \nderived within a particular lineage by modifying the \nchemical cocktails and culture conditions.\nTransdifferentiation by chemical-only induction of \nan intermediate plastic state\n  In addition to the direct reprogramming of somatic cells \ninto different lineages by the forced expression of line-\nage-specific transcription factors, pluripotency transcription \nfactors have been used to induce transdifferentiation. The \nlate transdifferentiation technique was named cell-activa-\ntion and signaling-directed (CASD) lineage conversion \n16  International Journal of Stem Cells 2016;9:9-20\n(48). In this paradigm, a brief expression of pluripotency \ntranscription factors dedifferentiates the starting cells into \nan unstable and plastic state (cell-activation) and then lin-\neage-specific differentiation signals direct them toward a \nspecific fate (49). This transdifferentiation technique still \nutilizes forced expression of transgenes. An integration-free \napproach for induction of the CASD lineage conversion \ncan be a chemical-only approach for induction the cell-ac-\ntivation step or plastic state. Interestingly, two studies \nhave used the chemical approaches to drive somatic cell \ntransdifferentiation using a similar methodology to the \nCASD lineage conversion (23). Cooke (24, 50) and Brevini \n(23) groups utilized small-molecules to induce a plastic \nstate in donor cells to become responsive to the environ-\nmental cues and eventually to drive transdifferentiation.\n  Concerning the important role of DNA demethylation \nduring early embryonic development and pluripotent re-\nprogramming, Brevini and colleagues reported that a \nshort-term exposure to 5-azacytidine (5-aza), a DNA meth-\nyltransferase inhibitor, in conjunction with culture in em-\nbryonic stem cell (ESC) medium can induce expression \nof pluripotency genes (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Zfp42) and \na state of plasticity in human skin fibroblasts and make \nthe cells responsive to the developmental cues (23). They \nshowed that administration of specific differentiation sig-\nnals using a three-step protocol establishes a pancreatic \nendocrine identity in the cells undergoing endocrine fate \nconversion (23). The generated β-like cells were func-\ntional in vitro and in vivo. They did not form tumor after \ntransplantation, this property together with the pa-\ntient-specific origin of the starting cells makes this trans-\ngene-free method of transdifferentiation appropriate for \ntherapeutic applications (23). \n  In this transdifferentiation paradigm, the action of \n5-aza is relatively similar to that of the pluripotency fac-\ntors in the CASD lineage conversion. Sufficiency of a brief \nexposure (18 hours) to 5-aza for induction of plasticity in \nhuman fibroblasts (23) offers new ideas for refinement of \nthe CASD approach and subsequently integration-free \nproduction of a variety of cell types from somatic cells.\n  Surprisingly, Lee et al. found that viral vectors in addi-\ntion to being simple vehicles for transcription factors par-\nticipate in pluripotent reprogramming by increasing epi-\ngenetic plasticity through the activation of toll-like re-\nceptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway and innate immunity \nresponses (50). Indeed, activation of TLR3 transcriptional \npathways leads to global changes in epigenetic modifiers \nfavored histone modifications needed for activation of en-\ndogenous pluripotency network (50). \n  Angioblast-like cells (51) and endothelial cells (ECs) \n(52, 53) have been produced previously using the CASD \napproach. Moreover, human induced ECs (iECs) have \nbeen directly generated by the forced expression of line-\nage-specific transcription factors (52, 54). Remarkably, \nSayed et al. taking the advantage of induced plasticity \nthrough the activation of TLR3 pathway generated ECs. \nIn this paradigm, TLR3 agonist Poly I:C together with en-\ndothelial cell differentiation signals, transdifferentiated \nhuman fibroblasts into functional ECs (Table 1). They in-\ndicated that the innate immune-mediated plasticity trans-\ndifferentiation protocol directly converts donor cells with-\nout passing through an intermediate pluripotent state \n(Fig. 1). Therefore, activation of TLR3 in combination \nwith developmental cues appears to be sufficient to induce \nan intended transdifferentiation in somatic cells without \nthe use of any genetic material (24).\nDiscussion\n  For a long time, it has been known that the cell fate \nis fluid and can be experimentally altered by the forced \nexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors (2). \nGenerating human iPSCs and their differentiation for the \nproduction of clinically relevant cell types is a cumber-\nsome process and remains problematic due to the use of \ngenetic materials in reprogramming and the presence of \nresidual pluripotent cells in its differentiated products, \nwhich are tumorigenic (55).\n  Various cell types have been produced by the forced ex-\npression of lineage-specific transcription factors. Although \ndirect reprogramming methods for the generation of de-\nsired therapeutic cells from the patient somatic cells by-\npass pluripotent state, they use genetic materials (6). \nThere are safety-related concerns associated with the use \nof viral vectors in direct reprogramming and trans-\ndifferentiation methods, which limit their use in the clin-\nical setting (6, 55).\n  Small-molecules have advantages that enable us to spa-\ntially and temporally control gene expression and cell fate. \nThey are easy to combine, handle, optimize, adjust, and \nwithdraw (9, 20). Selection of the proper small-molecules \nand adjusting their concentrations and duration in order \nto do precise modulation of multiple signaling pathways \nare critical for induction of a successful somatic cell re-\nprogramming (29, 56). Recent findings have shown that \ntransdifferentiation can be achieved without the need for \nectopic expression of lineage-specific transcription factors \nby only application of small-molecules and growth factors \n(19, 21-24, 26, 27). It has been indicated that small-mole-\ncule cocktails are sufficient to activate the expression of \nBehnam Ebrahimi: Chemical-only Transdifferentiation  17\nspecial master transcription factors of an intended cell fate \n(19). Interestingly, chemical approaches could produce de-\nsired cells directly from patient cells in much shorter time \nand without safety-related concerns (22). \n  In a previous part, the current study reviewed chem-\nical-only generation of neuronal cells and neural-progeni-\ntor cells from somatic cells (Table 1) (Fig. 1) (19, 21, 22, \n26). Cheng et al. showed that human urinary cells (hUCs) \nand different sources of mouse fibroblasts can be con-\nverted into ciNPCs using VCR under physiological hypo-\nxia (21). Moreover, they chemically converted mouse as-\ntrocytes into neurons (31).\n  Recently, Li et al. (19) and Hu et al. (22) designed \nchemical protocols that were successful in the generation \nof neuronal cells directly from human and mouse fibro-\nblasts (19, 22). Moreover, Zhang et al. reported that se-\nquential exposure to a cocktail of nine small-molecules \nconverts cultured human astrocytes into neurons (26). \nRegarding the inhibitory role of native gene regulatory \nnetworks during reprogramming (57), results from differ-\nent laboratories show that chemical protocols can erase the \nnative identity of the initial cells and activate endogenous \nneuronal transcriptional factors to establish neuronal fate \n(19, 22, 26). Chemical transdifferentiation of fibroblasts \nderived from patients with familial Alzheimer’s disease \n(FAD) into hciNs represents chemical approaches as an \nalternative tool for the generation of patient-specific neu-\nronal cells that could be appropriate for disease modeling \nand drug screening (22).\n  Cardiomyocyte-like cells have been generated by in-\ntroduction of lineage-specific transcription factors and \nmiRNAs both in vitro and in vivo (44, 47, 58, 59). Compared \nwith these methods, Fu et al. developed a full chemical \napproach for the generation of cardiomyocyte-like cells \n(27). This chemical method of cardiomyocyte generation \npasses through a progenitor stage, representing the ability \nof this method for the generation of both progenitors and \nmature cardiomyocytes. Progenitor cells may be ideal for \nregenerative purposes because they may be more robust \nin surviving in the hostile graft environment, and by their \nlimited proliferation could restore tissue function and con-\ntribute to revascularization (27).\n  Interestingly, findings have demonstrated that an extra-\nembryonic endoderm (XEN)-like state is essential for \nsmall-molecule-induced pluripotent reprogramming (29, \n30). However, the underlying mechanisms of chemical \ntransdifferentiation remain insufficiently defined. Thus, \nmore investigation is needed to elucidate molecular road-\nmap underlying chemical transdifferentiation. It has been \ndemonstrated that removal of reprogramming barriers fa-\ncilitates the action of transcription factors during pluri-\npotent reprogramming and significantly increase the effi-\nciency and kinetics of the process (42). Suggestively, the \nenhancing strategies developed for increasing the effi-\nc i e n c y  o f  i P S C  r e p r o g r a m m i n g  ( 4 2 )  m i g h t  b e  c a p a b l e  o f  \nenhancing the efficiency of chemical transdifferentiation \napproaches.\n  Another strategy for transdifferentiation is the in-\nduction of epigenetic plasticity in donor cells and sub-\nsequently providing developmental cues to promote line-\nage conversion (49). The findings of Pennarossa et al. (23) \nand Sayed et al. (24) suggest that experimental techniques \nof manipulation of innate immune signaling pathways or \nadministration of small-molecule modifiers of epigenome \ncould be used to induce epigenetic plasticity in somatic \nc e l l s  a n d  t o  e n g i n e e r  c e l l  f a t e  ( 2 3 ,  2 4 ) .  T h i s  f o r m  o f  c h e m -\nical transdifferentiation strategy is similar to the CASD \nlineage conversion, which uses iPSC transcription factors \nfor induction of a plastic state (49). However, in contrast \nto the direct reprogramming technology and the CASD \nparadigm, these chemical methods do not use any genetic \nmodification; this potentially allows their clinical applica-\ntion (23, 24). Considering the CASD method, lessons from \nin vitro differentiation of stem cells, and chemical-only re-\nprogramming, the CASD transdifferentiation could be ac-\ncomplished by small-molecules alone. Consequently, in-\nduction of a state of plasticity in somatic cells using chem-\nicals is a technical advance for the generation of a variety \nof therapeutic cell types. \nConclusions \n  Numerous small-molecules with diverse functions have \nb e e n  u s e d  i n  t h e  c h e m i c a l  p r o d u c t i o n  o f  d i f f e r e n t  c e l l  \ntypes (Table 2). Generally, small-molecules have different \nroles in chemical-only reprogramming approaches, includ-\ning induction of plasticity, inhibition of starting cell pro-\ngram, activation and establishment of target cell fate, and \nimprovement of the reprogramming efficiency. Similarly, \ngrowth factors play a critical role in induction and matu-\nration of converted cells by modulation of signaling path-\nways (Table 1). Moreover, fine-tuning the number and \nconcentration of small-molecules and growth factors is \nfundamental to an efficient chemical-only reprogramming \napproach. Suggestively, administration of reprogramming \nchemicals and growth factors in a stepwise manner with \na relative similarity to the fate determination during em-\nbryonic development that needs more understanding of \nthe mechanisms of the process would assist improving the \nefficiency, kinetics, and specificity of the chemical-only \n18  International Journal of Stem Cells 2016;9:9-20\nreprogramming.\n  Chemical-only approaches are more desirable for clin-\nical applications because they avoid potential complica-\ntions related to the use of genetic materials, including tu-\nmorigenicity, immune rejection, and homing behavior of \nthe injected cells in cell transplantation therapies (6). \nChemical reprogramming could be an alternative strategy \nto generate and investigate patient-specific cell lines. In \naddition to disease modeling and drug screening, chemical \napproaches hold great promises in regenerative medicine \nby induction of regeneration in vivo against different dis-\neases (e.g. neurological or heart diseases) or injuries (22). \nCollectively, the findings that are discussed here are proof \nof principle and open new avenues for a pharmaceutical \napproach to cellular therapy and in vivo  induced \nregeneration. The future may see the emergence of re-\nprogramming drugs, which are designed for regeneration \nand therapeutic applications.\nAcknowledgments\n  The author would like to thank Drs.
