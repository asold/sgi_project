INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers must always be kept healthy and opera-\ntional to maintain a reliable and efﬁcient electrical network.\nFailure of power transformers may cause substantial damage,\nincluding loss of human life.\nThe Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is extensively used to\nmonitor and diagnose incipient faults in power transformers.\nGases dissolved in the insulating oil are extracted, identiﬁed,\nand measured, before interpretation of the DGA results are\nmade. These gases are by-products of the oil when exposed\nto thermal and electrical energy, especially those caused by\nfaults. The amount and type of these gases are dependent on\nthe amount of energy the oil is exposed to [1].\nDue to the complex and stoichiometric nature of the oil\ndegradation process [1], DGA interpretation via gas ratio\napproach such as proposed by the IEC 60599 may arrive\nto the state of ‘no interpretation’ or inaccurate diagnosis.\nInsufﬁcient ratio-combinations or ‘code-absence’ may also\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Ugur Guvenc\n.\ncause the interpretation of DGA to become invalid [2]–[4].\nThese are the main factors that initiated the use of Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence (AI) in DGA interpretation. Other factors include\nhigh dependency on an expert’s opinion and inability of\nstandard methods to adapt to various designs and materials of\npower transformers. Among the categories of AI used in DGA\ninterpretation are i.e. neural networks [5]–[9], fuzzy logic or\nfuzzy inference system [10]–[12], clustering or classiﬁcation\nalgorithm [13]–[18], and hybrid [19]–[22].\nThe Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is among the earliest\nAI used for DGA interpretation [23]. Moderate computation\ndifﬁculty in developing SOM enables faster learning process.\nSOM is globally ordered and does not have the issue of local\nminimum [24]. SOM is also considered robust to arbitrary\ndata [2].\nPast applications of SOM required a large number of\nDGA results for its training (755 in [25], 963 in [26] and\n390 in [27]). Validation of SOM in [25] is done through com-\nparison with diagnosis produced by the conventional method.\nIn [26], the focus of research is on ageing and not on incipient\nfault detection, while in [27] the validation of SOM is not\n71798 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

DGA interpretation table in IEC 60599.\nclearly stated. Training and testing data in these researches\ncomprised of DGA results localized to the research while\nfault diagnosis is limited to detecting only 3 general fault\ntypes i.e. Thermal Fault (T), Electrical Discharge (D) and\nPartial Discharge (PD).\nIn more recent applications, SOM is combined with\nother artiﬁcial intelligence methods such as Support Vector\nMachine [28], Bayes Classiﬁer [27] and Principal Compo-\nnent Analysis [29]. Paper [28] presented a relative diagnosis\nof oil and paper condition, paper [27] reported the detection\nof electrical discharge, thermal fault and partial discharge\ndetection, and paper [29] focused on the detection of partial\ndischarge sources. Despite SOM showing good potential in\nvarious power transformer diagnosis, current SOM still lacks\nthe detection of fault severity in its DGA interpretation.\nIn this paper, SOM is trained using various combinations\nof input features and normalization methods. The training and\ntesting datasets are collected from [30]. Validation is also\ndone using actual fault cases from the IEC TC10 database.\nComparison with past SOM applications and other AI-based\nDGA interpretation method is also presented and the pro-\nposed method showed good diagnosis accuracy.\nThe ﬁrst section brieﬂy explained how DGA is performed\nand listed issues concerning its interpretation. Some of the\npresent AI-based DGA interpretation methods are also high-\nlighted. The second section gives an overview of DGA inter-\npretation method based on the IEC 60599 standard. The third\nand fourth section describes SOM’s algorithm and its diagno-\nsis process respectively. The section that follows presents the\nresult of SOM’s interpretation and its validation. Finally, con-\nclusion and future works are deliberated in the last section.\nII. DGA INTERPRETATION METHOD BASED\nON THE IEC 60599\nEvents such as overloading, switching and faults, release ther-\nmal energy inside the power transformer, causing the insulat-\ning oil to degrade. The oil degradation process produced gases\ni.e. Hydrogen (H2), Methane (CH4), Ethane (C2H6), Ethy-\nlene (C2H4), Acetylene (C2H2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).\nThere are other gases produced due to the degradation,\nhowever the above mentioned are the key gases monitored\nin DGA. The type and amount of these dissolved gases,\naccording to [1], correlate with six classes of faults that can\nbe categorized visually:\n• Partial discharges (PD)\n• Discharges of low energy (D1)\n• Discharges of high energy (D2)\n• Thermal faults of temperatures below 300 ◦C (T1)\n• Thermal faults of temperatures 300 ◦C to 700 ◦C (T2)\n• Thermal faults of temperatures above 700 ◦C (T3)\nIdentiﬁcation of fault is done using ratio calculation,\nas shown in Table 1. Combination of calculated gas ratios\ndetermines the type of fault experienced by the transformer.\nThis table is used when at least one of the gases exceeds its\ntypical gassing rates under normal operation. The same rule\nis applied when using the proposed SOM for fault diagnosis.\nA. DUVAL, ROGERS AND DOERNENBURG RATIO\nDuval Ratio uses the calculation of triangular coordinate\nto categorize the type of fault [1]. Duval Pentagon was\nthen introduced to complement the Duval Ratio [31]. The\nDuval Pentagon is considered the latest in its method. How-\never, its use is to complement the Duval Ratio and not to\nreplace it. The Rogers Ratio and Doernenberg Ratio use a\nsimilar approach to the IEC Ratio, but differs in the DGA\ninterpretation table used [32]. In this paper, a combined ratio\nis proposed as shown in Table 2. These ratios will be studied\nas the input features to SOM.\nB. IEC TC10 DATABASE\nIEC TC 10 database [33] is the reference used in the develop-\nment and revision of the IEC 60599 standard. The database\nconsists of DGA results observed in thousands of power\ntransformers, produced by different manufacturers, and oper-\nating in various individual network around the world. Due to\nits large and multi-manufacturer collection, this database is\ncommonly accepted as the universal database and is selected\nto validate the accuracy of the proposed SOM in this paper.\nIII. THE SELF-ORGANIZING MAP (SOM) AND ITS\nAPPLICATION FOR DGA INTERPRETATION\nInspired by the retina-cortex mapping in the human eyes, the\nnetwork diagram of SOM is illustrated in Figure 1. SOM is\na 2-layer, non-supervised neural network that organizes its\nVOLUME 8, 2020 71799\nS.

Structure diagram and key definition.\noutput based on the nature of its input data. Inputs to SOM\nare vectors connected to all nodes on the output plane. The\noutput layer consists of weighted nodes arranged on a 2D\nmap. The dimension or weight of each output node matches\nthe dimension of the input vector. SOM’s learning process\ngoes through the following steps [24]:\n1) The weight of the nodes on the output plane are initial-\nized using random real values\n2) One input is selected randomly from the training\ndatabase\n3) The Euclidean distance is calculated between the\nselected input vector and each of the node’s weight on\nthe output map, using equation (1)\n4) The node with the lowest Euclidean distance to the\ninput is selected as the BMU\n5) The neighbourhood function of the BMU is calculated\nusing equation (2)\n6) The weight of the nodes within the neighbourhood of\nthe BMU, is updated using equation (3)\n7) The process is repeated until convergence\nEuclidean distance calculation between input vector and\nnode’s weight, Dist:\nDist =\n√\n∑i=n\ni=0 (Vi −Ui)2 (1)\nwhere Vi is the input vector; Ui is the node’s weight.\nNeighbourhood function of the BMU, Wbi(t):\nWbi(t) =α(t)e\nsd(b,i)\n2δ2(t) (2)\nwhere t is the step or iteration count; b is the index of the Best\nMatching Unit (BMU); α(t) is the learning rate; δ(t) is the\nneighbourhood radius; sd(b,i) is the square distance between\nnode b (the BMU) and i on the output plane. Both α(t) and\nδ(t) are decreasing scalar functions to ensure convergence of\nthe SOM.\nWeight update function for nodes on the output plane at\niteration t:\nUi(t) =Ui +Wbi (t)[Vi −Ui] (3)\nIn short, on the output plane, the nodes’ weights will be\nupdated based on the inputs vector, resulting in nodes with\nhigh similarity to be ‘mapped’ closer to each other while\nnodes with low similarity will be mapped further from each\nother. The process is iterated until the SOM converges, pro-\nducing a feature map, where nodes with high similarities\nare clustered. Using the SOM feature map, diagnosis of trans-\nformer condition using DGA result can be done by plotting\nthe DGA result with the unknown transformer condition\nonto the feature map. The location of the plot or the cluster\nwhere the DGA result is mapped represents the incipient fault\nof the power transformer.\nIV. DIAGNOSIS PROCESS\nA. TRAINING THE SOM\nIn this paper, the diagnosis process is divided into two stages.\nFirst, the training of the SOM (refer Figure 2) and second, the\nvalidation (testing) of the developed SOM feature map (refer\nthe following section for details).\nPrior to creating the SOM, a review is conducted on various\nAI-based DGA interpretation methods. All input features and\nnormalization methods from these papers are identiﬁed and\nsummarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The result shows that\ninput features used in 33 researches are mainly ratios i.e. IEC\nratio, Duval ratio, Doernenberg ratio and the Rogers ratio,\nwhile the two most frequently used normalization methods\nare the range and ratio normalization.\nInput features and normalization methods identiﬁed from\nthese researches are combined and used as SOM’s input.\nOther input features and normalization methods are also\n71800 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS.

Input features identified from other AI-based DGA interpretation methods.\nTABLE 4. Normalization method identified from other AI-based DGA\ninterpretation methods.\nadded to increase the possibility of ﬁnding the best combina-\ntion of input features and normalization methods for SOM.\nTable 5 and Table 6 list the combination of normalization\nmethods and input features experimented in this research.\nA total of 540 DGA results with known faults are collected\nfrom [30]. These DGA results consisted of six fault types i.e.\nD1 (78 cases), D2 (147 cases), PD (57 cases), T1 (101 cases),\nT2 (68 cases) and T3 (89 cases).\nTo determine the best combination of input features and\nnormalization methods, three criteria are evaluated i.e. the\ntopological error [34], cluster existence and component plane.\nTopological error measures the ratio of DGA data vectors,\nwhere its ﬁrst and second BMUs are not neighbouring units,\nto the total of DGA vectors plotted on the output plane.\nHence, low topological error means the topology of the input\ndata is preserved.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 71801\nS. Misbahulmuniret al.: Improved SOM Clustering of Power Transformer DGA Using Inputs Pre-Processing\nTABLE 5. Normalization methods used in this research.\nTABLE 6. Combination of input features and normalization methods.\nCluster existence including clear separation between clus-\nters demonstrate the feature map’s capability to segregate the\nDGA results according to its fault.\nEach SOM has a component plane that shows the distri-\nbution and density of its inputs [34]. These inputs are gas\nconcentrations. According to [32], the key gases for each type\nof fault are; partial discharge (H2, CH4), thermal fault involv-\ning oil (C2H4, C2H6, CH4), and electrical discharge fault\n(H2, C2H2). Thus, the best combination of input features\nand normalization method is also identiﬁed by observing\nthe component plane that has the distribution and density of\ngases matching the type and severity of the fault as described\nin [32].\nIn this research, the MATLAB software and SOM Tool-\nbox [34] are used in the simulations of SOM. According to\nthe creator of SOM, the use of such toolbox is recommended\nto ensure correct implementation of SOM [34].\nB. VALIDATING THE SOM FEATURE MAP\nTheoretically, higher number of training datasets will\nimprove SOM’s diagnosis accuracy. However, these datasets\nneed to be checked for inconsistencies e.g. two or more\ndatasets having almost the same value and composition of\ngases but with different fault types. In actual, this can happen\nbecause some of these gases may have been released prior to\nthe oil sampling process. Different additives in insulating oil\nmay also cause different gassing rates. These datasets are con-\nsidered as outliers and are removed during SOM’s training.\nTABLE 7. SOM simulation results.\nTo minimize the effect of outliers, the approach of ﬁnding\nthe best training-test ratio (achieving best diagnosis accuracy)\nis applied. First, each fault type from [30] is divided into\nﬁve almost equally sized portions. Then, a portion from each\nfault type is combined to make a section. Next, these sections\nare then accumulated to produce several training-test ratios\nof 20:80, 40:60, 60:40 and 80:20. Finally, the SOM is sim-\nulated across these training-test ratios. The best training-test\nratio is selected when the best diagnosis accuracy is achieved.\nComparison is also done between the proposed SOM\nand the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Both AI-based\n71802 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. Misbahulmuniret al.: Improved SOM Clustering of Power Transformer DGA Using Inputs Pre-Processing\nFIGURE 3. Past SOM versus the proposed SOM (with clusters highlighted).\nFIGURE 4. Comparison of component planes between combination F28 and F30.\nmethods are simulated using the same training data. It is\nworth to mention that this is also a comparison between an\nunsupervised learning (the proposed SOM) and supervised\nlearning (SVM).\nTo further validate the feature map, DGA results with\nknown faults from the IEC TC10 database [33] are mapped\ndirectly on the SOM feature map developed earlier. These\ndata are not part of the training data and is totally foreign\nVOLUME 8, 2020 71803\nS. Misbahulmuniret al.: Improved SOM Clustering of Power Transformer DGA Using Inputs Pre-Processing\nFIGURE 5. Component planes of SOM simulated using combination F30. The key gases for each fault\ntype are partial discharge (H2, CH4), thermal fault involving oil (C2H4, C2H6, CH4), and electrical\ndischarge fault (H2, C2H2). The severity of fault can be seen increases as the area moves from middle\nright to the top left for electrical discharge faults, and from bottom right to middle left for thermal\nfaults. The partial discharge cluster has no severity levels and remains in the zone where H2 and\nCH4 is present.\nTABLE 8. Training-test ratio versus diagnosis accuracy.\nto the feature map. The feature map is validated if the known\nfault (of the test data) matches the fault cluster where the test\ndata are mapped.\nV. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA. BEST COMBINATION OF INPUT FEATURES,\nNORMALIZATION METHODS AND COMPARISON WITH\nPAST SOM APPLICATION\nTo determine the best combination of input features and\nnormalization method, three criteria are evaluated i.e. the\ntopological error [34], cluster existence, and component\nplane.\nTable 7 listed the top ten combinations of input features\nand normalization method with the lowest topological error.\nPast SOM application [25], [27] and the proposed SOM are\nrepresented by combination F1 and F30 respectively. Both\nSOMs were trained using the same set of data [30] and the\ntopological error recorded are 0.006 and 0.004 respectively.\nThe proposed SOM has lesser topological error than past\nSOM application. Fault clusters can be seen clearly compared\n71804 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. Misbahulmuniret al.: Improved SOM Clustering of Power Transformer DGA Using Inputs Pre-Processing\nTABLE 9.

Green squares indicate correct mapping, red means otherwise. (Key: a= T3, b= T2, c= T1,\nd = PD, e= D1, f= D2).\nto past SOM application where the cluster is non-existent. Six\nclearly visible clusters labelled as D1, D2, PD, T1, T2, and\nT3 are shown on the proposed SOM. Previous SOM applica-\ntions have no clear cluster and have no separation between\nthem. Combination F5 and F6 also share the same result\nwhere the cluster is non-existent. Summary of comparisons\nare listed in Table 9 and shown in Figure 3.\nCombination F28 has lower topological error than the F30.\nBoth component planes have the type and position of gases\nmatching the key gas criteria [32]. However, the distribution\nof gases on F30 is better than the F28 due to the much clearer\ngradient observed. Component planes from F28 and F30 are\ncompared in Figure 4.\nFor SOM simulated using combination F30, the severity\nof fault can be seen increases as the area moves from middle\nright to the top left for electrical discharge faults, and from\nbottom right to middle left for thermal faults. The partial\ndischarge cluster has no severity levels and remains in the\nzone where H2 and CH4 is present. Refer Figure 5.\nIn short, combination F30 produced a SOM which has low\ntopological error and clear fault clusters.

BEST TRAINING-TEST RATIO\nThe proposed SOM is simulated using several training-\ntest ratios. The resulting diagnosis accuracy is recorded\nin Table 8. The SOM is trained and tested using the train-test\nratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40 and 80:20. The result shows\nthat the best diagnosis accuracy is achieved at train-test ratio\nof 60:40. Thus, the SOM simulated at this stage is selected\nas the SOM feature map. Further addition of the training data\nrenders the diagnosis accuracy quite steeply.\nC. COMPARISON WITH OTHER AI-BASED DGA\nINTERPRETATION METHOD\nFor comparison purpose, another AI-based DGA interpre-\ntation method i.e. the Support Vector Machine is trained\nand tested using the same data and across the same\n71808 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. Misbahulmuniret al.: Improved SOM Clustering of Power Transformer DGA Using Inputs Pre-Processing\ntrain-test ratios. The SVM uses the Radial Basis Function\nkernel (Tensor Flow settings of C=10, Gamma scale setting)\nand the result is compared with the proposed SOM in Table 8.\nThe best diagnosis accuracy for SVM is achieved at the\ntrain-test ratio of 60:40. Further addition of the training data\ndoes not improve the diagnosis accuracy. Comparatively, this\nshows that the SOM has acquired enough training using 60%\nof the training data and further addition is not required.\nD. VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSED SOM USING IEC\nTC10 AND PUBLISHED DATABASE\nIn the IEC TC10 database, DGA results are divided into\nsix main categories i.e. reactor, instrument transformers,\nbushing, cable, power transformers with communicating\non-load tap changer (OLTC), and power transformers with\nnon-communicating OLTC. In this research, the focus is on\npower transformers.\nTo validate the proposed SOM, DGA results with known\nfaults from the IEC TC10 database are plotted onto the map.\nThe plotted map is shown in Figure 6 and the details of the\nvalidation are listed in Table 10. The diagnosis accuracy of the\nproposed SOM on DGA extracted from transformers without\ncommunicating OLTC and with communicating OLTC are\n77.8% and 72.7% respectively.\nLooking at Figure 6 and Table 10, it is worth mentioning\nthat almost all the errors recorded are neighbouring errors e.g.\na D1 fault clustered within D2 zones whilst being near to the\nborder of D1-D2. In this research, this is recorded as an error\nalthough it is a severity error, not a fault type error. Obtaining\ndeﬁnitive border remains an issue and will be considered in\nfuture research. If the results were evaluated based on the\nmain types of fault (thermal, discharge of electrical, and par-\ntial discharge), the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed SOM\non DGA extracted from transformers without communicating\nOLTC and with communicating OLTC areto 100% and 95.5%\nrespectively.\nIn the spirit of research, the universality of the proposed\nSOM is also tested against DGA results from other types of\nequipment in the IEC TC10 database i.e. reactor, instrument\ntransformer, bushing, and cable. A total of 51 DGA results are\navailable and the average diagnosis accuracy for fault severity\ndetection and fault type identiﬁcation are 84.3% and 96.1%.\nThis shows that the proposed SOM is capable of diagnosing\nfaults even in equipment other than the power transformer.\nAll these results are summarized in Table 10.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\nIn this research, the application of SOM to interpret DGA\nresults is improved through the combination of input features\nand normalization method. SOM using a combination of nor-\nmalized gas ratios as inputs produced accurate fault clusters\nand clearer boundaries compared to past SOM which uses\nindividual gases as inputs.\nBest combination of input features and normalization\nmethod is selected from SOM that produced low topological\nerror, identiﬁable cluster with separation, and component\nplanes with distribution and density of gases that match the\nkey gas criteria.\nCompared with previous applications of SOM, the pro-\nposed SOM uses lesser data and has improved fault sensitiv-\nity. The component planes of the proposed SOM provided a\ngood means of indicating fault severity. The proposed SOM\nalso has clear clusters and improved cluster separation that\nfacilitate fault identiﬁcation.\nThe diagnosis accuracy of the proposed SOM is also com-\npared with other AI-based DGA interpretation method i.e.\nSVM. It is worth mentioning that the proposed SOM is an\nunsupervised learning method while the SVM is a supervised\nlearning method. Comparatively, 60% of the training data is\nenough to train the SOM.\nThe feature map is validated using DGA results extracted\nfrom the IEC TC10 database. Diagnosis accuracy average for\nDGA results for transformers without communicating OLTC\nand with communicating OLTC are 77.8% and 72.7% respec-\ntively. The proposed SOM is also tested with DGA results\nfrom other equipment i.e. reactor, instrument transformer,\nbushing, and cable. High diagnosis accuracy average shows\nthat the proposed SOM is capable of diagnosing faults even\nin equipment other than the power transformer.\nThe SOM provides simplicity and practicality of assess-\nment by having a visual map, easily understood by non-\nexperts. From the component planes, the proposed SOM\nhas shown its capability of not only detecting incipi-\nent faults, but also showing gradients of fault severity.\nThis is very useful for future works involving condition\nmonitoring.\nIn a nutshell, the proposed SOM has been improved almost\nentirely using the right combination of input features and\nnormalization method.\nFor future works, this SOM will be studied to indicate fault\nseverity and possibly becoming a universal tool for detecting\nincipient faults for all equipment using hydrocarbon-based\ninsulating oil. The issue of determining the exact border\nbetween clusters remains to be studied.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank specially Ir. Dr. Sazali\nP.
