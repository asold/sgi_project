  "abstract": "Ultrasonography is an important routine examination for breast cancer diagnosis, due to its non-invasive, radiation-free and low-cost properties. However, the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer is still limited due to its inherent limitations. Then, a precise diagnose using breast ultrasound (BUS) image would be significant useful. Many learning-based computer-aided diagnostic methods have been proposed to achieve breast cancer diagnosis/lesion classification. However, most of them require a pre-define region of interest (ROI) and then classify the lesion inside the ROI. Conventional classification backbones, such as VGG16 and ResNet50, can achieve promising classification results with no ROI requirement. But these models lack interpretability, thus restricting their use in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a novel ROI-free model for breast cancer diagnosis in ultrasound images with interpretable feature representations. We leverage the anatomical prior knowledge that malignant and benign tumors have different spatial relationships between different tissue layers, and propose a HoVer-Transformer to formulate this prior knowledge. The proposed HoVer-Trans block extracts the inter- and intra-layer spatial information horizontally and vertically. We conduct and release an open dataset GDPH&SYSUCC for breast cancer diagnosis in BUS. The proposed model is evaluated in three datasets by comparing with four CNN-based models and three vision transformer models via five-fold cross validation. It achieves state-of-the-art classification performance (GDPH&SYSUCC AUC: 0.924, ACC: 0.893, Spec: 0.836, Sens: 0.926) with the best model interpretability. In the meanwhile, our proposed model outperforms two senior sonographers on the breast cancer diagnosis when only one BUS image is given (GDPH&SYSUCC-AUC ours: 0.924 vs. reader1: 0.825 vs. reader2: 0.820).",
