In its early beginnings the issue of cognition played no role in research or teaching on\nhearing loss. InNewby’s (1958)then-classic text in audiology, for example, the focus was squarely on\nperipheral hearing loss; any issues related to the pathways from the brain stem to and including the\ncortex was cited as the domain of neurology (Newby, 1958, pp. 53–55). Indeed, beyond supplying a\ndefinition of presbycusis as an age-related hearing loss, adult aging received no additional attention.\nItisnowwellrecognizedthatolderadults’successinspeechrecognition,especiallyunderdifficult\nlistening conditions, will be affected by cognitive factors: either in a positive way through support\nfrom linguistic context, or in a negative way where performance can be constrained by limitations\nin working memory and executive resources (van Rooij and Plomp, 1992; Humes, 1996; Gordon-\nSalant and Fitzgibbons, 1997; Wingfield and Tun, 2001; Pichora-Fuller, 2003). Just as audiology has\nbegun to recognize that cognitive factors may play a role in performance, so cognitive psychologists\nengaged in research on language comprehension in older adults are beginning to recognize that the\nfull picture of language comprehension cannot be understood without attending to the auditory\ndeclines that are common in normal aging. The joining of these two areas of expertise has seen a\ndramatic increase, giving rise to such terms as “cognitive hearing science” (Arlinger et al., 2009) and\n“ cognitive audiology ” (Jerger, cited inFabry, 2011, p. 20). The introduction of these terms reflects\nFrontiers in Psychology| www.frontiersin.org June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 6841\nWingfield et al. Modeling language comprehension\nan increasing emphasis on the importance of taking into\naccount how cognitive processes interact with hearing acuity in\ncommunicative behavior and remediation strategies to deal with\nhearing loss.\nThe broad sweep of issues underlying sensory-cognitive\ninteractions in the perception and comprehension of speech\nraises the need for a unifying framework to guide present\nand near-future research. The Ease of Language Understanding\n(ELU) model ( Rönnberg, 2003; Rönnberg et al. , 2008, 2013)\nstands as such attempt. In this article we examine aspects\nof the ELU model that apply especially to spoken language\ncomprehension in adult aging, where speed of processing\n(Salthouse, 1996), working memory capacity (Salthouse, 1994),\nand hearing acuity ( Lethbridge-Ceijku et al., 2004) are often\ncompromised. Throughout, we hope to offer a constructive look\nat the ELU model; where it is strong and where there are gaps to\nbe filled. In so doing we use this discussion as a vehicle to examine\ninteractions of perceptual, linguistic, and cognitive factors in\nspoken language understanding.\nThe ELU Model: A Brief Summary\nThe ELU model has developed from its original version\n(Rönnberg, 2003) to the more inclusive model as it is presented\ntoday (Rönnberg et al., 2013). The 2003 paper presents a basic\nframework along with a formulation to capture four parameters\nof spoken language understanding: (1) accuracy and features of\nsyllable representations; (2) the speed of access to long-term\nmemory (LTM); (3) the level of mismatch between the stimulus\ninputandthecorrespondingphonologyrepresentedinthemental\nlexicon; and (4) the processing efficacy and storage capacity\nof working memory. This initial model assumed an interaction\nbetween the quality of the sensory input, information available\nin LTM, and the utilization of working memory. Together\nthese would determine the ease with which language can be\ncomprehended under difficult listening conditions. An important\nelement in this initial presentation was a model assumption that\nphonological and lexical access are automatic (implicit) as long as\nno mismatch occurs between the sensory input and stored lexical\nrepresentations. When a mismatch occurs processing becomes\nexplicit, represented by employment of supportive context and\nengagement of working memory resources. This early foundation\nthus assumed a fundamental division between implicit and\nexplicit components in speech understanding.\nThe2013version( Rönnbergetal. ,2013)becamemorenuanced\nand more specific. In the former case it was now argued that\nimplicit and explicit processing may operate on the interaction\nof phonology and semantics in parallel. As such, long-term\nmemory (LTM) can be used either explicitly (a slow process)\nor implicitly (a rapid process) for understanding a spoken\nmessage. There was also an increasing attempt to say how\nworking memory capacity relates to attention, short-term storage,\ninhibition, episodic LTM, and listening effort. In addition, the\nmodel in 2013 distinguishes between types of LTM (episodic and\nsemantic) and how and when these memory systems are accessed\nat different stages of understanding. Rönnberg et al.’s (2008)\nversion implied a solely feed-forward system, with the rapid\nand automatic multimodal binding of phonology taking place\nin an episodic buffer through implicit processing that matches\ninputswithstoredrepresentationsinthementallexicon.The2013\nversion now recognizes the involvement of continuous feedback\nwith both predictive and post-dictive (backward) feedback loops.\nThis latter presumption is necessary given findings such as, for\nexample, the demonstration that the perception of sub-lexical\nsounds are influenced by top-down word knowledge (Samuels,\n2001).\nFinally, in Rönnberg et al. (2013) the ELU model has been\nbroadened to include multimodal integration in the form of\nvisual information from seeing a talker’s articulatory movements,\nprocessedinamodality-generallimitedcapacityworkingmemory\nsystem. In this latter regard there is certainly ample evidence\nfor multimodal integration beginning withSumby and Pollack’s\n(1954) demonstration that people perceive speech in noise better\nwhen they can see the speaker’s face. Access to such visual\ninformation can also be advantageous for older adults (Sommers\net al., 2005; Feld and Sommers, 2009). With these recent revisions,\nthe ELU model sets up a new line of predictions. Many of\nthese predictions relate to the effects of different signal qualities,\nthe type and modality of the inputs (hearing, vision, and sign\nlanguage), and the relationship of working memory capacity to\ndifferent encoding operations and other memory systems.\nAlthough the ELU model has become more inclusive, there\nare aspects of language processing that remain underrepresented\nin model. We address several of these issues below. In so doing\nwe place special emphasis on spoken language understanding by\nolder adults following typical age-related changes in cognitive\nefficiency and hearing acuity. As we shall see, the cognitive\nliterature, upon the ELU model should rely, remains unsettled\non many critical issues. These issues also form a part of our\ndiscussion.\nConceptions and Control Functions in\nWorking Memory and its Capacity\nAs we have noted above, working memory plays a central role in\nthe ELU model, where it is seen as carrying a number of cognitive\nfunctions relevant to language understanding. Most conceptions\nof working memory in the cognitive literature have in one way\nor another postulated a trade-off between processing and storage,\nwhether conceived in terms of a shared general resource (Just\nand Carpenter, 1992; Carpenter et al., 1994), or a limited-capacity\ncentral executive (Baddeley, 1996; Logie, 2011). Mechanisms that\nhave been proposed to underlie the limited capacity of working\nmemory have included time-based models in which switching\nattention from processing to storage or updating and refreshing\nthe memory trace are constrained by the time parameters of these\nprocesses (Barrouillet et al., 2004, 2012). In this latter regard\ndescriptions of working memory and executive function begin\nto merge, with these terms often used along with the even more\ngeneral term, “resources” (often, without distinction, referred\nto as attentional resources, processing resources, or cognitive\nresources).\nAmodelthatfocusesonlanguageunderstandingunderadverse\nlistening conditions would benefit greatly if it could rest on settled\nFrontiers in Psychology| www.frontiersin.org June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 6842\nWingfield et al. Modeling language comprehension\nconceptions of working memory and executive function in the\ngeneral cognitive literature. As yet such a simple consensus has\nyet to emerge. It might be helpful to adoptMcCabe et al.’s(2010)\ncharacterization of working memory as focusing on the ability\nto store and manipulate information, and executive function as\nfocusing on goal-directed behavior, monitoring and updating\nperformance, set shifting, and inhibition (cf.Hasher and Zacks,\n1988; Hasher et al., 1991; Cowan, 1999; Engle, 2002; Fisk and\nSharp,2004;BoppandVerhaeghen ,2005;Logie,2011),albeitwith\neach containing elements of the other and all of these abilities\nassociated with activity in prefrontal cortex (McCabe et al., 2010).\nIn its current version the ELU model cites the importance of\ninhibition and executive function in speech processing, but the\nrelationship between these functions and working memory are\nas yet not clearly articulated within the model (Rönnberg et al.,\n2013, p. 10). The challenge in doing so is highlighted inMcCabe\net al. (2010) who report a strong correlation between tests of\nworking memory capacity and those purported to test executive\nfunctioning (r = 0.97), with only processing speed showing\nindependence.Althoughthereisagreementthatworkingmemory\ncapacity is limited, and more limited in older relative to younger\nadults (Salthouse, 1994, 1996; Salthouse et al., 2003), there is no\nuniform agreement within the cognitive aging literature on the\nmechanisms that underlie this limitation.\nOur own view is closely aligned with the postulate that\nworking memory capacity is determined by how well one can\nfocus attention (Engle et al., 1999; Engle and Kane, 2004). A\ncase in point is Cowan’s (1999) Embedded-Process model that\nsees working memory as an activated subset of information\nwithin LTM. The source of the well-known capacity limitation\nin working memory is seen as due to the limited capacity of\nattentional focus that operates on the activated areas within\nLTM (Cowan, 1999). As such, the capacity of working memory\narises from both a time limit on activation of items in memory,\nunless refreshed, and a limit on attentional capacity in terms\nof the number of items that can be concurrently activated\n(Cowan, 2005). What we describe here is a process-based\nview of working memory and working memory capacity that\nallows concurrent activation of representationally distributed\ninformation, a potential mechanistic account for the modality-\ngeneral aspects of working memory postulated in the ELU model.\nControl Functions in Working Memory\nThe emphasis in the ELU model is on communication, which\nsets it apart from many extant models of speech recognition and\nlanguage understanding that focus more narrowly on specific\nprocesses and in many cases do not address how the systems\noperateunderadverse listeningconditions.Considerableresearch\nhas shown that the perceptual effort attendant to poor listening\nconditions has a negative impact on recall of speech materials\n(Rabbitt,1968,1991;Pichora-Fuller et al.,1995;Surprenant,1999,\n2007; Wingfield et al., 2005) and comprehension of sentences that\nexpress their meaning with non-canonical word orders typical of\nsyntactically complex speech, with this latter effect compounded\nby effects of age, hearing acuity, and rapid speech rates (Wingfield\net al., 2006).\nIn the ELU model the degree of effort engendered by task\ndifficulty affects the degree to which explicit processing will be\nengaged. Among such explicit processes must be an ability to\nmonitor the ongoing capacity of working memory as speech\narrivesinrealtime. Figure 1showsdatatakenfromourlaboratory\nin which we probed the effect of listening effort on the ability to\nmonitor the capacity of working memory as speech is arriving\nin real time. For this purpose we used aninterruption-and-recall\n(IAR)paradigminwhichparticipantslistentoastringofrecorded\nwords with instructions to interrupt the input when they believe\nthey have heard the maximum number of words that will allow\nfor perfect recall of what has been heard. Germaine to our present\ninterests, the word-lists were presented at one of two sound levels:\nat 25 dB SL to represent listening ease, and 10 dB SL to represent\neffortful listening. The participants were young adults with age-\nnormal hearing (Amichetti et al., 2013, Experiment 2).\nFigure 1A shows the mean number of words correctly recalled\ninasimplebaselinespantaskinwhichlistenersheardlistsvarying\nin length from one to 12 items for immediate recall. It can be seen\nthat for list lengths of up to three words recall is at ceiling, and\nat near-ceiling for a four-item list length at both intensity levels,\nthus confirming the audibility of the stimuli at the two sound\nlevels. Beyond a four-item list, additional stimulus items yield\nprogressively smaller recall gains that never peak beyond means\nof 5.8 items for the 25-dB SL lists and 4.3 items for the 10-dB SL\nlists. This small but significant difference affirms the above-cited\nnegative effect of effortful listening on recall.\nFigures 1B,C areofgreaterinterestastheyshowwhathappened\nwhen participants heard supra-span lists with instructions to\ninterrupt the word-lists with a keypress when they believed they\nhad heard the maximum number of words that they could recall\nwith perfect accuracy.

One\ncan see a shift in the peaks of the two distributions, from a\nmodal self-selected segment length of six words for lists at the\nlouder 25-dB SL level, to seven words, at the 10-dB SL level.\nSpecifically, at 25 dB SL the modal segment size of six words\nwas close to the mean for accurate item recall of 5.8 words in\nthe baseline span condition at that sound level shown in the left\npanel,suggestingagoodabilitytocalibratesegmentsizeselections\nwith actual memory span.

We show with the above data that this control itself may\nbe affected by the necessity to process a low-quality signal. In part\nthe lower sound level may have slowed the stimulus encoding,\nresulting in an overlap in time in which the cognitive system is\nconcurrently conducting perceptual and encoding operations on\none stimulus as another is arriving (Miller and Wingfield, 2010;\nPiquado et al., 2010). It is also possible that a reduced stimulus\nintensity may truncate the duration of an already rapidly fading\nechoic trace (Baldwin, 2007; Baldwin and Ash, 2011).\nThis control function in working memory may be obscured\nin natural speech if listeners are allowed to periodically interrupt\na spoken narrative to give themselves time to process what they\nhave heard before the arrival of yet more information. In this case\nboth young and older adults tend to interrupt the speech input at\nmajor linguistic clauses and sentence boundaries rather than after\na set number of words (Wingfield and Lindfield, 1995; Piquado\net al., 2012; see also Wingfield et al., 1999; Fallon et al., 2006).\nImportantly, such findings are indicative of listeners’ access to\nsyntactic and semantic knowledge as the speech is being heard,\nand hence being involved in very early stage processing. We will\naddress the implications of early access in several places in the\nfollowing discussion.\nThe Implicit versus Explicit Distinction\nFundamental to the ELU model is the position that when speech\nquality is good, with a clear match between acoustic input and\nits corresponding phonological representation in LTM, lexical\nrecognition will be automatic (“implicit”). That is, lexical access\nwill be rapid, resource-free, and will not require access to top-\ndown information such as linguistic or semantic context. When\nthe input quality is poor, whether due to external factors such\nas background noise, or internal factors such as hearing loss or\na distorted phonological representation in LTM consequent to a\nlong-term hearing impairment, the degraded information can be\nsupplemented by linguistic or real-world knowledge, a process\nthat requires explicit or “effortful conscious processing” (Mishra\net al., 2013, p. 2).\nUse of the terms implicit and explicit processing in the ELU\nmodel resonate with the early ( LaBerge and Samuels , 1974;\nShiffrin and Schneider, 1977), but still often used distinction\nin the cognitive literature between automatic versus controlled\nprocesses.Inthecontextofspeechperception,automaticprocesses\nemphasize bottom-up, stimulus-driven processing that is rapid,\nobligatory, and demanding few if any resources. By contrast,\ncontrolled processes tend to be top-down, voluntary, and to one\ndegreeoranotherresource-demanding( Pashleretal. ,2001).They\nare also assumed to require some level of awareness (LaBerge and\nSamuels, 1974; Posner and Snyder, 1975; Shiffrin and Schneider,\n1977; Flores d’Arcais, 1987). All of these attributes fit squarely\nwith the characterization of implicit and explicit processing as\nrepresented in the ELU model.\nAlthough early-stage perception is often considered to be\nautomatic, arguments have been offered for cognitive and\nattentional control operating at the earliest stages of input\nprocessing of speech (Nusbaum and Magnuson, 1997; Heald and\nNusbaum, 2014). It should also be recognized that a system\nthat appears to be resource-free could require resources but\nnot those shared with other processes. This exact position was\ntaken by Caplan and Waters (1999) who argued that on-line\nsyntactic operations are conducted by sentence-specific resources\nnot measured by traditional working memory tasks such as the\nDaneman and Carpenter(1980) readings span task or its several\nFrontiers in Psychology| www.frontiersin.org June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 6844\nWingfield et al. Modeling language comprehension\nvariants. They suggest that the appearance of effects working\nmemory limitations on sentence processing represent post-\ninterpretive processes rather than on initial syntactic parsing. Our\npresent focus, however, is the specific assertion in the ELU model\nthat when there is degraded input perceptual operations will shift\nfromautomatictocontrolledprocessing,withthelatterincreasing\nthe drain on working memory resources (Rönnberg et al., 2013).\nProposals of binary, either-or process distinctions have been\na hallmark of early theory development in cognitive psychology\nsuch as distinctions drawn between semantic versus episodic\nmemory ( Tulving, 1972), procedural versus non-procedural\nlearning ( Squire, 1994), implicit versus explicit memory in\nreference to priming studies ( Schacter, 1987), and so forth.\nIn each case subsequent studies have shown none of these\nproposed distinctions to be process pure. In a similar way,\nthe distinction between automatic (implicit) versus controlled\n(explicit) processes can best be seen as two ends of a continuum\nand a matter of degree rather than the sharp contrast current in\nthe ELU model.\nAlthough drawing a distinction between implicit and explicit\nprocesses, Rönnberg et al. (2013) note that the extent to which\nexplicit or implicit processing may be employed can vary over the\ncourse of a single task, with the ratio changing from moment to\nmoment during a conversation depending on signal quality and\nspeech content (see alsoRönnberg et al., 2010).\nIt is the case that the automatic versus controlled distinction\nretains descriptive utility (Birnboim, 2003; Schneider and Chen,\n2003), but only insofar as one thinks of some operations being\npotentially “more automatic” than others in a relative or graded\nsense (Chun et al., 2011).\nThe Match versus Mismatch Distinction\nThe match versus mismatch distinction highlighted in the ELU\nmodel may be accepted as an idealized principle, although such\na distinction should be treated with caution. This is so because\nthere is rarely a perfect match between a phonological input and\nthe phonological representation of an item in the mental lexicon.\nThis is due to the variability in the way words and their sub-lexical\nelements are articulated from speaker to speaker, and effects of\nsyllabic context within a single speaker (Liberman et al., 1967;\nMullennix et al., 1989).\nAtthemorecognitivelevel,analysesofnaturalspeechshowthat\nspeakers tend spontaneously to employ afunctional adaptationin\ntheir production. That is, we tend to articulate more clearly words\nthat cannot be easily inferred from context, and to articulate less\nclearly those that can (Hunnicutt, 1985; Lindblom et al., 1992).\nIt is not assumed that these dynamic adjustments are consciously\napplied by the speaker, any more than we assume that listeners\nare necessarily consciously aware of using acoustic and linguistic\ncontext in their perceptual operations.\nBecause of this functional adaptation, what one might call\nan articulatory principle of least effort, words are often under-\narticulated when they can be predicted from the context,\nand many words would be unintelligible were it not for the\nphonemic and linguistic context in which they are ordinarily\nheard (Lieberman, 1963; Pollack and Pickett, 1963; Grosjean,\n1985; Wingfield et al., 1994). Because of this variability perfect-\nmatch template matching models of perception must be an\nineffective account of perceptual identification. To the extent that\nthe ELU model presumes a perfect or near perfect match between\nphonologicalinputsandstoredcounterpartsinLTMasthedefault\nconditionwithnaturalspeech,thiswouldbeoutoftunewiththese\ndata. It should be noted that although the earlyRönnberg (2003)\nformulation implied a stark contrast between a perfect match\nversus one that requires top-down support, the current model\nversion sees word recognition in terms of a threshold function\naffected by phonological and semantic attributes (Rönnberg et al.,\n2013). This question relates to broader issues in the role of\nlinguistic context in speech recognition and comprehension.\nThe Role of Context\nA common view in speech recognition is that questions related to\neffects of context should be framed in terms of top-down effects\noperating on initially stimulus-driven perceptual processes. The\nELU model is in general accord with this principle, although an\napparently conflicting observation appears in the suggestion in\nRönnberg et al. (2013) that if a sentence context is sufficiently\npredictive, a target word might be activated even with minimal\nphonological input (Rönnberg et al., 2013). This presumption,\nalthough consistent with everyday experience, would not seem\nto follow at first look from the precepts of the ELU model. It\nwould follow, however, from a number of extant models of word\nrecognition.\nMost models of word recognition, to include the ELU model,\nassume a reciprocal balance between bottom-up information\ndetermined by the clarity of the speech signal and top-down\ninformation supplied by a system of linguistic knowledge (e.g.,\nMorton, 1969, 1979; McClelland and Elman , 1986; Marslen-\nWilson, 1987). It is the compensatory availability of preserved\nlinguistic knowledge and the procedural rules for its use that\naccounts for the general effectiveness of speech comprehension in\nadult aging in spite of cognitive and sensory declines (Wingfield\net al., 1991; Pichora-Fuller et al., 1995; Wingfield and Stine-\nMorrow, 2000; Pichora-Fuller, 2003). Although these principles\nare embodied within the broad outlines of the ELU model,\nquestions remain as to whether context comes into play before,\nduring, or after the acoustic representation of a word unfolds in\ntime.\nA model that assumes that context activates lexical possibilities\nbefore a stimulus word is heard was embodied in one of the\nearliestinteractivemodels:theso-called“logogen”modelthatalso\nwent through a period of development (Morton, 1964a,b, 1969,\n1979).Mortonpostulateda“dictionary”of“units”(laterre-named\n“logogens”), with each unit corresponding to a word represented\ninLTM.Whenthelevelofactivationofalogogenexceedsacritical\nlevel, the unit “fires,” and the corresponding word is available as a\nresponse.\nIn this model each unit has a resting potential, or base level\nof activation, determined by the relative frequency with which\nthe unit has fired in the past. This is reflected behaviorally in the\nword frequency effect, in which words that have a high frequency\nof occurrence in the language are recognized faster or with less\nFrontiers in Psychology| www.frontiersin.org June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 6845\nWingfield et al. Modeling language comprehension\nstimulus information than low-frequency words (Howes, 1957;\nGrosjean, 1980). Following the firing of a unit its resting level\nof activation increases sharply, resulting in recency or repetition\npriming,andthendecaysslowly.Throughdirectconnectionswith\nother units, the activation of any given unit adds to the level\nof activation of all associated units, whether this association is\nsemantic, categorical, or based on shared attributes.\nIn operation, a sensory input would be coded in terms of the\npresence of detected phonological features, the presence of which\nwould simultaneously increase the level of activation of all units\nsharing these phonological features. Thus, the unit sharing the\ngreatest number of features with the presented stimulus would\nreceive the greatest increase in its level of activation. It can be seen\nfrom this formulation that the amount of stimulus information\nrequired for a unit to exceed its critical level and “fire,” would\nbe lower either when there is already a high level of residual\nactivation(thewordfrequencyeffect),whenthelevelofactivation\nhas been temporarily raised by a recent firing of the unit (recency\npriming), or by the firing of an associated unit or units (an effect\nof context).\nWithin the Logogen model, a highly constraining linguistic or\nenvironmental context that increases the likelihood of occurrence\nof a stimulus word will increase the level of activation of that\nitem in the mental lexicon, thus priming the entry even before\nthe stimulus is actually encountered. The higher the level of\nactivation, the less stimulus information will be required for\nrecognition of the target word. Activation due to contextual\nexpectancy would thus override units’ initial resting potentials\ninitially determined by their relative frequency of occurrence\nin the language, and hence, their likelihood of re-occurrence.\nA constraining linguistic or environmental context would also\noverride other factors known to affect the intelligibility of\nindividual words, such as the detrimental effect of a large number\nof words that share initial or overall phonology with the target\nword (cf. Tyler, 1984; Wayland et al., 1989; Wingfield et al.,\n1997; Luce and Pisoni , 1998). These general principles have\nbeen embodied in a number of models, to include TRACE,\na computational model in which the above factors, operating\nin parallel, can be implemented by transient weighting factors\n(McClelland and Elman, 1986).\nAcorrelateofMorton’smodelisthatifthelevelofactivationofa\nlexicalunitissufficientlyraisedduetoahighprobabilityofitbeing\nencountered, a lexical unit may “fire” in the absence of objective\nstimulus information. It can be seen that Morton’s logogen model\nand others like it offer a mechanistic account noted byRönnberg\net al.(2013) that if a sentence context is sufficiently predictive, a\ntarget word might be activated even with minimal phonological\ninput.Thisprincipleofaninverserelationshipbetweenthe a priori\nprobabilityofawordandtheamountofphonologicalinformation\nneeded for its recognition is a well established finding in the\nliterature for both spoken and written words and for both young\nand older adults ( Black, 1952; Bruce, 1958; Morton, 1964a,b;\nCohen and Faulkner, 1983; Madden, 1988). It should be pointed\nout, of course, that the more likely scenario following the same\nprinciple is the misidentification of an indistinct word as a word\nwith a similar sound that is a closer fit to a semantic context\n(Rogers et al., 2012). Either case, however, would necessitate a\ncloser look within the ELU model at whether context raises lexical\nactivation before (Morton, 1969), during (Marslen-Wilson and\nZwitserlood, 1989), or after (Swinney, 1979) the word unfolds in\ntime.\nIn contrast with models that assume that linguistic context\nraises target activation even prior to acoustic input, we have\nseen that a basic tenet of the ELU model is that an acoustically\nclear stimulus with a correspondingly rich mental representation\nresults in automatic (implicit) lexical access; a rapid, obligatory,\nresource-free process. In the model context comes into play\nonly when poor stimulus quality does not allow an immediate\nmatch at which point context “kicks in.” The process being\ndescribed is suggestive of early modular models of lexical access\nsuch as Forster’s(1976; 1981) argument for autonomous lexical\naccess: a self-contained modular system, with restricted access\nto information. Such an “informationally encapsulated” (context-\nfree) process fit within Fodor’s (1983) broader argument for\nmodularity within cognitive domains and processes.\nThe positive influence of a constraining sentence context or\nother sources of semantic priming on the accuracy or speed\nof lexical access (e.g., Holcomb and Neville, 1990) appears as\ninconsistentwiththepostulateofacontext-impenetrablemodular\nview of lexical access. This issue is not easily settled in spite of a\nhistoryofcreativeexperimentsintendedtodeterminewhetherthe\nfacilitationobservedwith aconstrainingsentencecontextreflecta\ntrueaccesseffect(cf., Swinney,1979;Seidenbergetal. ,1982,1984;\nStanovich and West, 1983).\nTheissueiswhetherthewell-documentedeffectsofexpectancy\non ease of lexical access, and especially the suggestion that a\nsufficiently strong expectation can activate a lexical entry in the\nabsence of sensory input, is most compatible with a pre-lexical\n(e.g., Morton, 1969) or a post-lexical (e.g.,Forster, 1981) effect.\nOur reading of the ELU model appears to favor both positions,\nan issue that would need to be reconciled as the model develops\nin detail.\nBefore leaving this issue, we might also suggest that a complete\nmodel for word recognition should include not only the level\nof activation of a lexical entry as determined by contextual\nexpectancy and the goodness of fit with the stimulus, but also on\nthe individual’s acceptance criterion level. This flexible criterion\nlevel would be determined by such factors as the priority given to\nspeed versus accuracy (Wagenmakers et al., 2008) or the reward\nfor a correct recognition versus the negative consequences of\nmaking an erroneous identification (Green and Swets,1966). This\nposition thus adds motivational state to the quality of the sensory\ninput and the sensory capacities of the listener.\nAge and Inhibition in Word Recognition:\nThe Role of Working Memory\nBenichov et al.(2012) examined ease of recognition of sentence-\nfinal words heard in noise with participants aged 19–89 years,\nwith levels of hearing acuity ranging from normal hearing to\nmild-to-moderate hearing loss.

Modeling language comprehension\ncontributor to recognition of sentence-final words by the time\nthe linguistic context was strongly predictive. By contrast, a\ncognitive composite of individuals’ episodic memory, working\nmemory, and processing speed accounted for a significant\namount of the variance in word recognition for words heard\nin a neutral context and for all degrees of contextual constraint\nexamined. (The contextual probability of the target words was\ntaken from published “cloze” norms, which report the percentage\nof participants who give particular words when asked to complete\nsentence stems with the final word missing.)\nOne likely candidate for the role that working memory capacity\nmay play in word recognition was revealed in a study byLash\netal. (2013)whoexaminedeffectsofage,hearingacuity,andexpe-\nctations for the occurrence of a word based on a linguistic context.\nImportantly, the study also examined the effects of competition\nfrom other words that might also fit the semantic contexts.Lash\net al. (2013) used the technique ofword-onset gating, in which a\nlistener is presented with an increasing amount of a word’s onset\nduration until the word can be correctly identified ( Grosjean,\n1980,1996). When a linguistic context is absent, word recognition\nis affected by the number of words that share the initial sounds\nwith the target word (Tyler, 1984; Wayland et al., 1989), further\nlimited by words that share syllabic stress (Wingfield et al., 1997;\nLindfield et al., 1999; see alsoWingfield et al., 1990).\nA major focus of theLash et al.(2013) study was the effect of a\nlinguistic context on word recognition that, as we have previously\nindicated, will override such factors as word frequency or the\nnumber (“density”) of phonological competitors as determinants\nof word recognition. A critical feature of published cloze norms\n(e.g., Lahar et al., 2004), however, is that when participants have\nbeen asked to complete sentence stems, also reported is the full\nrange of responses given by each of the participants, and the\nnumber of participants giving these alternative responses. These\ndata allow one to estimate not only the expectancy of a sentence-\nfinal word based on the transitional probability of that word in the\nsentence context, but also the uncertainty (entropy) implied by the\nnumber, and probability distribution, of alternative responses that\nalso might be implied by the context.Lash et al.(2013) found that\nwhile both young and older adults’ word recognition benefitted\nfrom a sentence context that increased word expectancy, a differe-\nntially negative effect of the presence of strong competitor respo-\nnses was found for older adults independent of hearing acuity.\nThis latter finding is consistent withSommers and Danielson’s\n(1999) proposition that older adults have greater difficulty than\ntheir young adult counterparts in inhibiting non-target responses.\nIn Sommers and Danielson’s(1999) case the competition came\nfrom the presence of a larger number of phonological “neighbors”\nof target words. The present case differed only in that response\ncompetition came from the distribution of words that also shared\na contextual fit with a semantic context. Such results would\nbe expected from arguments that older adults have a general\ninhibition deficit (Hasher and Zacks, 1988), that in this case,\nwould interfere with word recognition.\nA subsequent study byLash and Wingfield(2014) directly exa-\nmined working memory capacity and effectiveness of inhibition\nin word recognition as would be predicted from observations\npresent in the current version of the ELU model. This study was\nbased on the finding that gradually increasing the clarity of a\nstimulus until it can be correctly identified retards its recognition\nrelative to when a stimulus is presented just once, even at a level\nof clarity below that needed for recognition using an ascending\npresentation.Thisfinding,observedoriginallyfordegradedvisual\nstimuli, has been interpreted as reflecting the negative effect\nof interference from incorrect identification hypotheses formed\nduring the incremental presentations that would not be present\nwith a single presentation (Bruner and Potter, 1964; Snodgrass\nand Hirshman, 1991; Luo and Snodgrass, 1994).\nLash and Wingfield (2014) conducted an analogous study\nfor spoken words using word-onset gating with older adults\n(M =75years)withgoodhearingacuity(PTA <25dBHL)andan\nage-matchedgroupwithamild-to-moderatehearingloss.Agroup\nof young adults with normal hearing acuity was also included for\ncomparison. For each individual we determined the word-onset\ngate size that allowed the participant to recognize correctly 40 to\n60% of target words when they were presented successively with\nincreasing onset durations (an ascending presentation). We also\ndetermined for each individual the recognition accuracy level for\ncomparable words presented just once (afixed presentation) with\nthe same gate size that yielded the 40 to 60% correct recognition\nwith an ascending presentation. The size of the interference\neffect from ascending presentations would be indexed by the\ndifference between word identification rates under the two\npresentation conditions. The question was whether individual\ndifferences in working memory capacity might predict one’s\nability to inhibit interference from false identification hypotheses\npresumed to be formed in the course of the incrementally larger\nand larger word onset durations represented in the ascending\npresentation condition (e.g.,Snodgrass and Hirshman, 1991; Luo\nand Snodgrass, 1994).\nAs might be expected from age and inhibition arguments,\nthe older adults in the study showed a larger interference effect\nfrom ascending presentations than the young adults. Germaine\nto our present question, a follow-up regression analysis revealed\nthat participants’ reading spans, taken as a measure of working\nmemory capacity (Daneman and Carpenter, 1980; McCabe et al.,\n2010), contributed significantly to the size of the interference\neffect (seeLash and Wingfield, 2014, for full details). The reading\nspan test, which we discuss in a subsequent section, was used\nrather than a listening span version (e.g.,Wingfield et al., 1988)\nto avoid a potential confound with hearing acuity.\nThis effect of working memory span on the effectiveness\nof inhibition can be illustrated most clearly in Figure 2 in\nwhich we have taken data fromLash and Wingfield(2014) and\nhave plotted the percentage of correct identifications for the\nsame gate size when words were presented in the fixed versus\nthe ascending presentation conditions separated by participants’\nworking memory span. A participant was considered to have a\nhigh working memory span (left panel) if they scored greater\nthan one standard deviation above the mean for their age cohort\ndetermined byMcCabe et al.(2010), or a low span if they did not\n(rightpanel).Thesedataarebasedonasubsetofparticipantsfrom\nLash and Wingfield(2014) where high and low span participants\nwithin each participant group were equal in number and matched\nfor age.\nFrontiers in Psychology| www.frontiersin.org June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 6847\nWingfield et al. Modeling language comprehension\nAlthough for the high span participants some variability\nappears in the difference between identification scores for the\nfixed versus ascending presentation conditions, especially for\nthe young adults, none of these differences reached significance.\nBy contrast, the lower span participants in each of the three\nparticipant groups consistently show a significant interference\neffect even after adjusting for differences in baseline recognition\naccuracy.\nThese data can thus be taken to offer empirical support for\nthe suggestion in Rönnberg et al. (2013) that working memory\ncapacity may affect the efficiency of inhibitory processes (see\nalso Sörqvist et al., 2012). It should be noted, however, that a\nrelationship between working memory capacity and effectiveness\nof inhibition leaves open the direction of causality. Indeed, an\ninfluential argument has been made that it is a failure of the ability\nto inhibit off-target interference that may determine the size of\none’s working memory capacity (Hasher and Zacks, 1988; Hasher\netal.,1991).Wewillhavemoretosayonthistopicinthefollowing\nsection.\nInput Challenge at the Sentence Level:\nDeep versus Shallow Processing\nA premise of the ELU model is that a perceptual mismatch due to\na poor quality stimulus causes a shift from implicit (automatic) to\nexplicit (controlled) processing where support from linguistic or\nenvironmental context are brought into play through involvement\nof working memory. As outlined in the model, this shift will slow\nprocessing but hopefully lead to a successful solution. Because\nsyntactic resolution of a sentence is arguably a precursor to\ndetermination of sentence meaning, this would imply that, when\nspeech quality is poor, listeners will engage in an especially\ndetailed and explicit syntactic analysis. Rönnberg et al. (2013),\nhowever, offer a qualification: when placed under time pressure,\nand if the listener is willing to accept the gist of the message, such\na close analysis might not take place (Rönnberg et al., 2013, p. 10).\nThere is no doubt that this latter point is true, both intuitively\nand empirically. We would suggest, however, that in natural\nlanguage comprehension such gist processing may be the rule\nrather than the exception. This would be so since in listening to\nspoken discourse one is almost always under time pressure due\nto the rapidity of natural speech and the transient nature of the\nspeech signal. Ordinary speech rates average between 140 to 180\nwords per minute, and can often reach 210 words per minute\nas, for example, with a radio of TV newsreader working from a\nprepared script (Stine et al., 1990).\nAlthough in many cases a complete syntactic analysis may be\nconducted as a precursor to determining a sentence meaning,\nthere is considerable evidence that listeners often, perhaps more\noften, take processing short-cuts, sampling key words and using\nplausibility to understand the meaning of an utterance. Because\nwe live in a plausible world this strategy will in most cases yield\nrapid and successful comprehension, albeit with comprehension\nerrors should one encounter a sentence with an unexpected or\nimplausible meaning.\nAnalyses of everyday discourse show that most of our\nsentences, when they are in fact grammatical, tend to have\nmeaning expressed in a relatively simple noun-verb-noun\ncanonical word order with the first word representing the\nagent or source of the action ( Goldman-Eisler, 1968). Thus,\nso long as the syntax is represented by canonical word order\nand the meaning of a sentence is plausible, a gist analysis will\nmost often yield a correct understanding. This strategy goes\nunnoticed because it invariably works; it is revealed, however,\nwhen comprehension fails. In such cases listeners “mishear” a\nsentence as if it were sensible, such as the sentence, “The teenager\nthat the miniskirt wore horrified the mother” ( Stromswold\net al., 1996). Examination of individuals’ comprehension of such\nsentences have shown that comprehension errors frequently\noccur, suggesting the absence of a full syntactic analysis of a\nsentence input in favor of sampling key words, assuming that\nthe word order represents the meaning in a canonical form, and\nthat the semantic relations being expressed in the sentence are\nplausible (Fillenbaum, 1974; Sanford and Sturt, 2002).\nFerreira (2003) has formalized these notions, suggesting that\nheuristic short-cuts may be taken by all listeners, by-passing a full\nsyntactic analysis but instead using word-order and plausibility\nas a rapid first-pass comprehension strategy (Ferreira et al., 2002;\nFerreira,2003;Ferreira and Patson,2007). AsFerreira et al.(2002)\nhaveargued,itshouldnotbeassumedthatallrelevantinformation\nfrom a detailed and time-consuming lexical and syntactic analysis\nwillbeusedineverydaycomprehension. SanfordandSturt (2002),\nfrom the perspective of computational linguistics, come to a\nsimilar conclusion. That is, to use Ferreira and Patson’s(2007)\nwords, sentence processing is as often as not conducted at a\nlevel of analysis that is “good enough” for comprehension. As we\nhave argued above, this processing strategy will yield the right\nanswer more often than not. It is consistent with the slowed\nprocessing and limited working memory capacity of older adults\nthat Christianson et al.(2006) have argued that a “good enough”\nprocessing heuristic may be even more common in the elderly.\nWorking Memory and Language\nComprehension\nThere are a variety of working memory measures in the literature\ndesigned to capture operational capacity. Important among them\nis the reading span task introduced byDaneman and Carpenter\n(1980), that focuses more specifically on verbal working memory\n(Carpenter et al., 1994). It is a version of this reading span task\nthat serves as the preferred measure of working memory in the\nELU-related studies conducted by the Rönnberg group.\nThereadingspan(orlisteningspan)taskrequiresthelistenerto\nread (or listen to) a series of sentences and, to insure the sentences\nare being comprehended, to state after each sentence whether it\nis true or false, or in some variants, whether the meaning of the\nsentence is plausible or implausible. After a set of sentences is\nfinished the reader (or listener) must recall the final word of each\nsentence, or he or she receives a signal to recall either the last word\nor the first word of each of the sentences. The span is taken as\nthe number of sentences that allow accurate recall of the final, or\nthe first or final words depending on the version (cf.Daneman\nand Carpenter, 1980; Rönnberg et al., 1989; Waters and Caplan,\n1996; McCabe et al., 2010). As previously noted, the reading span,\nFrontiers in Psychology| www.frontiersin.org June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 6848\nWingfield et al.

(Data fromLash and Wingfield, 2014, Psychology\nand Aging, Viol. 29.) *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.\nas opposed to a listening span version, is preferable when speech\nis involved in order to avoid a confound with hearing acuity or\nstimulus clarity.\nWe earlier cited the claim byCaplan and Waters(1999), based\non their work and the work of others, that working memory,\nat least as tested with the reading span task of Daneman and\nCarpenter (1980) and its variants, does not constrain, or by\ninference carry, on-line sentence comprehension. In contrast,\nthe well-known meta-analysis byDaneman and Merikle (1996)\nshowed reading span scores to reliably predict performance on a\nnumber of language comprehension and language memory tasks.\nIn addition to mixed findings in experimental studies relating\nreadingspanstoefficacyinlanguagecomprehension(see,therev-\niewin Wingfieldetal. ,1998)thereisasimilarcasefortheabilityof\nworkingmemoryspanasmeasuredbyreadingspan,asapredictor\nofperceptionofspeechinnoiseorwithreducedhearingacuity(cf.\nAkeroyd, 2008; Schoof and Rosen, 2014; Füllgrabe et al., 2015).\nIt is possible that the mixed findings in studies using the\nreading span as a measure of verbal working memory may lie\nin the intentional complexity of the reading span task itself,\nwith this complexity allowing task demands or nuances of the\ninstructions to affect the sensitivity of the span scores across\ndifferent experiments. When one considers the reading span task\nit can be seen that there is an opportunity for a trade-off on\nthe part of the reader or listener between recalling the sentence-\nfinal or sentence-initial words versus processing efficiency on\nthe sentence comprehension component of the task. Indeed,\nindividual differences in strategy use and session-to-session\nvariability has been shown to occur in even less complex memory\ntasks (e.g.,Logie et al., 1996).\nWaters and Caplan (1996) recognized that the reading span\ntask, because it involves both storage and processing components,\nis a better measure of working memory than a simple span test\nthat has only a storage component. The task also has face validity\nas both the reading span task and language comprehension\nrequire temporary storage of verbal material along with ongoing\nsyntactic and semantic computations. As Waters and Caplan\nnote, this complexity of the Daneman and Carpenter (1980)\nreading span task focuses solely on the storage component of\nthe task (recalling the sentence final words as the span measure)\nbut not the efficiency with which the sentence comprehension\ncomponent is conducted. To overcome this limitation they\nsuggest a more valid measure might be represented by an\nindex that takes into account sentence comprehension accuracy,\nthe number of sentence final words that can be recalled, and\nas a measure of efficiency at sentence processing, response\ntimes to the sentence judgments. Represented as a z-score\nthey show this composite measure to have better test-retest\nreliability than the original Daneman and Carpenter (1980)\nspan test.\nAn additional criticism of theDaneman and Carpenter(1980)\nspan test is that participants always know in advance that they\nwill be asked to recall the last word of each of the sentences. That\nknowledge might lead to development of processing strategies by\nthe participant. To overcome this issue Rönnberg et al. (1989)\ndeveloped a span task that uses a post-cueing method in which\nthe participant reads the stimulus sentences without knowing in\nadvance whether they will be asked to recall the first or the final\nword of each sentence. This instruction is given after a sentence\nset has been presented.\nIn these regards, we suggest that a large-scale meta-analysis of\nstudies compare and contrast findings using extant variations of\nthe reading span task. Such an analysis should include relative\nstrengths in terms of test-retest reliability where available.\nFrontiers in Psychology| www.frontiersin.org June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 6849\nWingfield et al. Modeling language comprehension\nThe above discussion has focused more on the reading span\nas a measure of working memory capacity than on the memory\nsystems that may be involved in speech comprehension at the\nsentence level. On the one hand, our discussion of “good enough”\nsentence processing suggests that an abstract representation\nof sentence meaning is formed as a sentence is being heard.\nOn the other hand, our ability to “replay” the sensory input\nto retroactively repair an initial misanalysis of a garden-path\nsentence implies the support of a briefly sustained veridical trace\nof the input.\nThis apparent paradox was recognized by Potter (1993;\nPotter and Lombardi, 1990), who proposed that as a sentence\nis heard, both a verbatim trace of the spoken input and a\nsemantic abstraction are concurrently formed and briefly stored\nin memory. Depending on the momentary needs of the listener\nor complexity of the speech materials, the individual might rely\nmore or less heavily on the transient verbatim trace, whether\nthis is thought of as a phonological, articulatory, or echoic store.\nIn everyday listening the default mode may be reliance on the\nabstracted semantic trace for constructing narrative coherence,\nwiththeconcurrentlyavailableverbatimtraceaccessibleforabrief\nperiod if needed for specific task requirements or if access to the\noriginal input is needed in order to rescue an initial processing\nerror. In the case of understanding meaningful speech, such a\nmodel might account at least in part for many of the paradoxes\noutlined above.\nResource-Limited versus Data-Limited\nProcesses\nIn performing a complex cognitive task one would expect that, at\nleast to some limit, the level of performance will improve with the\namountofeffort (resources)giventothattask.Thisreferstoa task\nthat is “resource-limited”: the upper limits on performance will be\nset only by the amount of resources one is willing, or able, to apply\nto it (Norman and Bobrow, 1975). In cases of degraded input,\nperformance can often be improved with additional effort. There\nare other cases where the stimuli are of such poor quality that no\namountofeffortorallocationofresourceswillimprovethelevelof\nperformance. In such cases, when the upper limit on performance\nis determined by the limited quality of the stimulus, the task can\nbe referred to as data-limited (Norman and Bobrow, 1975). Most\ntasks, even ones with a poor quality stimulus, are resource-limited\nup to some point where one’s performance is limited only by\nthe amount of resources one is willing to devote to it. It is only\nbeyond this point that one can say that the task is data-limited.\nAlthough questions have arisen about distinguishing between\na data-limited transition and possible constraints of a ceiling\neffect (Norman and Bobrow, 1975; Kantowitz and Knight, 1976).\nNorman and Brobrow’s(1975) conceptualization is a descriptively\nimportant one.\nWithin the context of whatNorman and Bobrow(1975) would\ncall the resource-limited range, one can describe three “zones”\nof listening conditions: (1) effortless listening, where working\nmemory resources are not drained by perceptual processing\ndemands, (2) effortful but successful listening where errors will\noccurunlessresourcescanbereallocatedfromothertasks,and(3)\neffortful but error-prone listening which is not yet data-limited,\nbut where there are insufficient or non-optimally allocated\nresources(see SchneiderandPichora-Fuller ,2000;Pichora-Fuller,\n2003, for discussions). Poor-hearing older adults would reach\nthese points of effortful listening with higher sound levels than\nthose with better hearing, and they would be reached sooner for\nmore complex speech materials than simpler materials.\nAlthough traditionally theorists have focused on just one\ndirection of activity, whether on limited resources constraining\nperceptual effectiveness ( Kahneman, 1973; de Fockert et al. ,\n2001; Lavie et al., 2004) or perceptual effort reducing higher-\nlevel cognitive effectiveness (Rabbitt, 1968, 1991; Dickinson and\nRabbitt, 1991; Murphy et al., 2000) one can postulate a single\ninteractivedynamicwhichmayoperateinbothdirections:limited\nresources may impede successful perception when the quality of\nthe sensory information requires perceptual effort for success,\nwhile successful perception in the context of a degraded stimulus\nor a hearing loss may draw on resources that might otherwise be\navailable for downstream cognitive operations. These notions fit\nacceptably within the ELU model and it is hoped that they are\nmore fully developed in future versions of the model.\nConclusion\nThe ELU model can fairly be represented as a work in progress\nwith many gaps to be filled. The model nevertheless serves\nas a useful framework for thinking critically about language\nunderstanding, especially under difficult listening conditions.\nThat is, a model has value not only when it answers all of our\nquestions,accountsforextantdata,andmakesspecificpredictions\nfor experiments yet to be conducted. A model also has value when\nclose scrutiny highlights what we know and what we do not know;\nthe broader the sweep of the model the more this is likely to be so.\nOur goal in this discussion has been to point to places in\nthe model where there are gaps that are yet to be filled and\nwhere the model could be productively expanded. In doing so\nwe acknowledge that the ELU model represents a unique attempt\nto formulate a unifying framework to describe sensory-cognitive\ninteractions especially under difficult listening conditions.\nAn important feature in the development of the ELU model\nhas been a shared focus both on theory and on the practical\nimplications of cognitive resources in remediation in the case of\nhearing loss (e.g., Rudner and Lunner, 2013). The effectiveness\nof the rapid development of sophisticated signal processing\nalgorithms, whether in traditional hearing aids or in cochlear\nimplants, must take into account the cognitive supports and\ncognitive constraints of the user, especially, we suggest, in the case\nof the older listener. The integrative approach of the ELU model\noffers an ideally suited framework on which to carry continued\nresearch on this critical interaction.\nAcknowledgments\nOur work is supported by NIH grant R01 AG019714 from the\nNational Institute on Aging (AW).
