    "abstract": "Traditional deep learning approaches for breast cancer classification has predominantly concentrated on single-view analysis. In clinical practice, however, radiologists concurrently examine all views within a mammography exam, leveraging the inherent correlations in these views to effectively detect tumors. Acknowledging the significance of multi-view analysis, some studies have introduced methods that independently process mammogram views, either through distinct convolutional branches or simple fusion strategies, inadvertently leading to a loss of crucial inter-view correlations. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-view network exclusively based on transformers to address challenges in mammographic image classification. Our approach introduces a novel shifted window-based dynamic attention block, facilitating the effective integration of multi-view information and promoting the coherent transfer of this information between views at the spatial feature map level. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance and effectiveness of transformer-based models under diverse settings, employing the CBIS-DDSM and Vin-Dr Mammo datasets.
