Parallels between chimpanzee tool use and the archaeological re-\ncord have been drawn [7– 12], and in recent years the need for systematic comparisons between\nthe two data sources has been widely recognized [13– 16]. Modern humans that still use stone\ntools are also powerful analogs for understanding the evolution of technological behaviors\n[17]. There are, however, recent arguments stating the importance of also usingPan troglodytes\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613 March 20, 2015 1/2 2\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Benito-Calvo A, Carvalho S, Arroyo A,\nMatsuzawa T, de la Torre I (2015) First GIS Analysis\nof Modern Stone Tools Used by Wild Chimpanzees\n(Pan troglodytes verus) in Bossou, Guinea, West\nAfrica.

Early hominins and modern\nchimpanzees share some relevant features (e.g., brain size, arboreal adaptations, likely use of\npercussive technology) [21– 23]. In addition, chimpanzees, regardless of variability in habitat\ntype, group size, presence of predators, hunting behavior, etc, are all tool users [24]. More im-\nportantly, they have the largest and most complex repertoire of tool use apart from humans\n[25], with sequential use of tools [26] and use of tool-composites [11].\nStone tools used by wild chimpanzees have normally been associated with the presence of\nspecific surface features such as depressions or concavities [4]. Pounding tools with similar fea-\ntures have been reported in archaeological assemblages such as Gesher Benot Ya´aqov (Israel),\nwhere presence of pitted stones has been associated with nut cracking activities [27]. Pitted\nstones have also been described in Olduvai Beds III and IV (Tanzania), although these have\nbeen linked to bipolar knapping activities [28] rather than to nut cracking. Similar tools have\nbeen also described in Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic sites [29– 31] as well in Holocene sites\nwhere, for example, Australian assemblages show that pitted stones can also be associated with\nshell fish processing [32].\nAn avenue for stone tool-use comparisons between chimpanzee and human ancestors is the\napplication of archaeological perspectives to the West African chimpanzee stone tool assem-\nblages, pioneered by Mercader et al [33– 34]. More recent approaches have combined studies of\nsuch material culture with a direct observation of wild chimpanzee behavior [10– 11], [35], in\norder to establish direct links between artifact patterns, site formation and chimpanzee\ntechnological behavior.\nThese pioneering works have paved the way for the use of an archaeological perspective to\nthe study of chimpanzee stone tool use, in which nonetheless systematic analysis of battered ar-\ntifacts is still lacking [36]. Recent progress on the study of battered stone tools in archaeological\ncontexts [36– 39] is leading to innovative approaches in this new field of research. However, de-\nspite the increasing amount of data available in Primatology and Archaeology, and the growing\nawareness of its relevance for understanding the evolution of technology in the human lineage\n(see [40– 41] for a new round of analytical approaches to percussive technologies), the lack of\nsystematic analysis of modern chimpanzee stone tools still precludes direct comparisons be-\ntween the technological records of human and non-human primates.\nThe aim of this study is to present the first systematic analysis of modern nut-cracking tools\n(anvils/hammers) through the application of new GIS techniques to identify, grade and quanti-\nfy damage patterns in the artifacts used by wild chimpanzees in Bossou (Guinea-Conakry). In\naddition, we present a variety of new analytical methods that will allow further quantitative\ncross-comparisons between human and non-human assemblages, and which will contribute to\nestablishing a contextual framework in which the co-evolution of stone-tool technology in the\nhuman and chimpanzee lineages can be better understood.\nMaterials\nStudy site\nThe village of Bossou, in Guinea, West Africa, harbors a population of wild chimpanzees (Pan\ntroglodytes verus) that have been systematically studied since 1976 [3], [42]. Bossou is one of\neight long-term field sites for the study of chimpanzee behavior [15]. The core range of this\ncommunity (comprised by 13 individuals during this data collection period) lies within the\nsmall forest of Bossou, and is between 5 and 7 km2. Bossou chimpanzees are especially known\nfor making and using a large variety of tools [3], [25] and, more specifically, for the habitual\nuse of a pair of movable stones (anvil and hammer stone) to crack open oil palm nuts (Elaeis\nguinneensis), which are abundantly available [3], [43– 44]. There are only two West African\nFirst GIS Analysis of Bossou Chimpanzees Modern Tools\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613 March 20, 2015 2/2 2\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nsites where stone tool use by chimpanzees has been the focus of systematic studies: Bossou in\nGuinea and Taï in Ivory Coast. The chimpanzee community at Bossou represents a unique\ncase study to examine the role of percussive technology in the evolution of technology: 1) this\npopulation does not customarily use boulders or wood as tools. The nut-cracking activities rely\nmostly on the use of movable stone tools [11]; 2) Stone tool dimensions are relatively‘stan-\ndardized’ [10], partially due to the species of nut that is cracked, i.e. the oil-palm, which is rela-\ntively soft [45]. Thus, tools are of small to medium size, and both the hammer and anvil along\nwith the nuts are often transported to the nut-cracking sites [35].\nThe outdoor laboratory and the experimental procedure\nIn 1988, a so-called‘outdoor laboratory’ was initiated in the Bossou forest (Latitude 7°\n38'52.07\"N, Longitude 8°30'17.95\"W, WGS84), which is a part of the public National Research,\nwith the permission of the Direction Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique\n(DNRS) and the Institute de Recherche Environnementale de Bossou (Republic of Guinea).\nThis has been running for 26 years, providing exceptional insights concerning the development\nof tool use behavior and of the experimental assemblages used by these chimpanzees. All re-\nsearch involving wild chimpanzees was non-invasive and strictly adheres to ethics guidelines\ndetailed by the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. This study (introduction of\nnuts and stones) is approved by the committee for the Ethical guideline of studying wild pri-\nmates of the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University (2013). Kyoto University has been\ndirecting all research conducted in this field site, in collaboration with the Guinea authorities\nsince 1976. The‘Outdoor Laboratory’ is a small cleared area on the top of a‘sacred’ hill, within\nthe core range of the wild chimpanzee community. Here, researchers place a matrix of num-\nbered stones along with seven piles of nuts around the matrix, and wait behind a screen of veg-\netation for the chimpanzees to visit (Fig. 1and see [10– 11], [43], for more details of the\noutdoor methods). Each year, the nut cracking“experimental season” varies between Decem-\nber and February– this falls within the dry season and the peak of chimpanzee nut-cracking\nbehavior [46]. The sample of stone tools analysed for this study was used by the wild chimpan-\nzees during the nut-cracking season of December 2008 to February 2009, when 47 experimen-\ntal sessions were conducted (totaling 34 h 48 min) using two species of nuts:Elaeis guineensis\nFig 1. Bossou‘outdoor laboratory’. A) View of the experimental area in the Forest of Bossou, Guinea. Researchers record the nut-cracking behavior every\nyear, using several video cameras while staying behind a screen of vegetation, c. 20m distance from the wild chimpanzees using tools.

Another small sample of stone\ntools (N = 2) used by the same chimpanzee population in a monitored natural nut-cracking\nsite of the forest (Fig. 2) was analysed to compare with results from the experimental assem-\nblage. Stone tools analysed were of local raw materials (amphibolite and African iron oxide).\nCriteria to select stone tools for this study were: 1) artifacts that had indisputably been used\nfor pounding activities by Bossou chimpanzees. 2) Objects representative of the raw materials\nusually available in the natural nut-cracking sites (e.g., African iron oxide and amphibolite). 3)\nArtifacts with clear battering marks susceptible of being analysed digitally and microscopically.\nMethods\nEach battered surface was digitized, 3D scanned (3D laser scanner Next Engine) and analysed\nseparately (8 battered surfaces out of 6 artifacts), following the GIS methods outlined in\nS1 Text. Identification of damage patterns in Bossou chimpanzee stone tools involved visual\nmapping [40] and automatized morphometric classifications. GIS morphometric classification\n[47– 51] lacks initial input from the analyst, and grouping is based on an automatized GIS iden-\ntification of variables, derived from 3D models scanned from the Bossou tools. In order to as-\nsess the validity of both techniques, visual mapping and morphometric classifications of the\nBossou percussive tools were conducted independently, in such a way that the analyst of\nthe morphometric classification had no access to the original artifacts but was provided with\nthe 3D models suitable for the GIS study.\nFig 2. View of a natural nut-cracking site in Bossou forest, with tools 4 and 5 analysed in this study.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613.g002\nFirst GIS Analysis of Bossou Chimpanzees Modern Tools\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613 March 20, 2015 4/2 2\nMorphometric GIS analysis\nResulting Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of each scanned tool face (N = 8) were used for sur-\nface morphometric analysis of topographic attributes calculated with GIS (ArcGIS 10.1 and\nSAGA 2.1). Several Digital Surface Models (DSM) were calculated from elevation data\n(S1 Text), such as primary and secondary derivates (i.e. slope, aspect and curvatures), hillshad-\ning models, or topographic profiles [48– 49]. These DSM were used for a first basic morpho-\nmetric analysis of the stone tools surfaces. Subsequently, roughness [52– 58], topographic\nposition [50], [59], and relative depth DSM were calculated (S1 Text), in order to identify and\ninterpret use-wear features. Roughness was used to estimate polish areas. We applied three dif-\nferent roughness indices: Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI), Vector Ruggedness Measure\n(VRM), and the 3D/2D area ratio (see details inS1 Text). In addition, topographic position\nindex (TPI) and relative depth models were applied to map and characterize surface depres-\nsions, in order to identify concavities associated with percussive activities.\nVisual mapping and GIS spatial pattern analysis\nFollowing protocols outlined by de la Torre et al [40], digital images were geo-referenced in a\nlocal Cartesian system using ArcGIS 10.1. Macroscopically-identified percussive marks were\noutlined over the images, and indexes such as area, perimeter, and distribution and size of the\nareas covered by percussion marks (S1 Text), were calculated to produce a spatial pattern of\nthe use wear distribution along the tools.\nResults\nMorphometric analysis\nThis analysis was based first on a basic morphometric study, in order to characterize the topog-\nraphy of stone tools surfaces. Then, we applied specific morphometric indices with a significant\nrelevance in the identification of use wear features such us polish areas and depressions. Com-\nbining these indices, we generated a final morphometric classification which summarizes the\nspatial distribution of morphometric features for each artifact face.\nBasic morphometric analysis. Results of basic morphometric analysis are shown in maps\nand tables ofS1– S4. The statistical analysis of elevation of each battered face (S1 Fig. and\nS1 Table) indicates that artifacts 43 and 431 bear the highest mean elevations, followed by arti-\nfact 55, while artifact H4FB, H4, A/H55FB and A70 yield the lowest values. Slope distribution\nin stone tool faces indicates predominance of low-intermediate slopes (S2 Fig.), particularly in\nthe 10.5º-31.1º range. There are few areas with slope values greater than 45º, which are mainly\nrestricted to the artifact edges; only artifacts 43 and 431 (and to a lesser degree in artifact A3)\nconsistently contain> 45º scarps across the surface. Artifacts A43 and A431 show the greatest\nmean slope, with values around 33– 34º (S1 Table), while the rest of the objects have mean val-\nues between 23º and 26º. Curvature models (S3 Fig.) were simplified in a combined curvature\nmodel [60]( S4 Fig. andS2 Table). This model shows that predominant curvatures in the bat-\ntered faces are V/V (convex profile and plan curvatures) and X/X (concaves plan and profile\ncurvatures), with percentages respectively of 33.7% and 35.1%. Surfaces with X/V and V/X cur-\nvatures decrease to 15% of the cases, while the rest of the curvature cases are insignificant\n(/C200.1%) (S4 Fig.). Such proportions observed for all battered surfaces remain similar when\npercentages of curvature classes for each artifact are calculated (S4 Fig.).\nPolish quantification: roughness indices.Polish in stone tool surfaces are usually associ-\nated with intensive use. Quantification of polish differences assists to recognize areas of the\nstone surface more heavily used, and to discriminate used from unused areas. Polish was\nFirst GIS Analysis of Bossou Chimpanzees Modern Tools\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613 March 20, 2015 5/2 2\nestimated through different roughness indices: TRI, VRM and 3D/2D area ratio indices\n(S1 Text). The three resulting roughness models for the artifacts are shown inS5 and S6 Figs.,\nwhere values has been calculated for each cell considering the closest neighborhood (radius = 0.1\nmm). Results are consistent and indicate a broadly similar roughness distribution, with areas of\nlow roughness and high roughness on similar positions across the three models. There are\nnonetheless some differences (S1 Table): while artifacts 43 and 431 (African iron oxide) display\nthe highest mean values in the three roughness models, the rest of tools show variable patterns\nin the TRI model and (particularly) the VRM model, which capture small roughness differ-\nences among the battered surfaces (S5 Fig. andS1 Table). The TRI model suggests that artifacts\nA/H55FB and H4 share nearly the same lowest mean values, but the VRM model positions H4\nas the tool with the lowest roughness. A3, A70 and H4FB pieces present intermediate values.\nThe combined or final roughness model showed inFig. 3asynthesizes variability of the\nthree roughness models (TRI, VRM and 3D/2D area ratio). From this model, we have derived\nthe lowest roughness areas (value<0.01), which represent the distribution of the most polished\nareas in each piece (Fig. 3b). Polished areas are more abundant in tools A/H55FB, H4FB and\nthen A431, while the lowest percentage of polished areas is in A70 (Table 1). To enhance visi-\nbility of the distribution of polished areas, a density map was calculated using a search radius\nof 0.6 mm (Fig. 3c), which shows in red the areas where density of polished spots is highest.\nDepression identification: TPI and relative depth models.Depressions are key features\nproduced during nut cracking activities. In this work, automatic identification of depressions\nand their characterization were calculated using TPI, relative depth models (S1 Text) and topo-\ngraphical profiles. Since TPI is a scale-dependent phenomenon, it can be used to identify de-\npressions of different size, according to the scale of measurement. InS7 Fig., the TPI index was\ncalculated considering a neighborhood of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mm. TPI 0.1 mm and TPI 0.5 mm\nmaps show smaller depressions and ridges of the tool surface, whereas TPI 1 mm shows more\nregional depressions. Lowest values of TPI 0.5 mm and TPI 1 mm were then combined to clas-\nsify the artifact ridges (where TPI>0) and depressions (where TPI<0). The resulting map in-\ncludes both small and large depressions and ridges across the battered surface (Fig. 4).\nTPI analysis indicates that in general, depressions are slightly more abundant than ridges,\ncovering 55.1% of the surface of tools (Fig. 4, Table 2). This ratio is similar in every artifact\n(Table 2) except for objects A3 and A431, which are dominated by large depressions (Fig. 4),\nand where the proportion of depressions to ridges is slightly higher (57.8% and 56.7% respec-\ntively, Table 2). Depressions are usually characterized by higher slopes (mean slopes of 31º)\nand higher roughness (VRM = 0.10, TRI = 0.06 and 3D/2D area ratio = 1.36) (S3 Table), asso-\nciated with scarps and slopes contained within the depressions. Ridges display mean slopes of\n26º, and roughness values of VRM = 0.07, TRI = 0.04 and area ratio = 1.21).S4 Tableshows\nthe statistical distribution of elevation, slope and roughness in the depressions and ridges for\neach artifact.\nRelative depth models (Fig. 5) indicate different patterns in the objects. Artifacts A3, A43\nand A431 show the deepest depressions (depth<-4mm), while pieces A/H55, A/H55FB, H4\nand H4FB feature intermediate values around-2 mm. Artifact 70 yielded the lowest values,\nwith depressions averaging -1mm.\nMorphometric classification. A morphometric classification of the artifacts based on\nslope, roughness and TPI results is shown inFig. 6. This classification provides the spatial pat-\nterns and distribution of surface morphometric features for each artifact, including ridges and\ndepressions, polished areas (lowest roughness areas, roughness<0.01), and scarps\n(slope > 45º). When polished areas and depression/ridges are superimposed, it is observed that\npolished areas develop in ridges as well as in depressions, but are much more abundant in\nridges (Table 3). For example, 75.8% of the polished areas in artifact A43 are located in ridges,\nFirst GIS Analysis of Bossou Chimpanzees Modern Tools\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613 March 20, 2015 6/2 2\nFig 3.

This pattern only changes in artifact A3,\nwhere polished surfaces are less abundant in ridges, due to a large depression in the center of\nthe anvil that contains most of the polished areas (Fig. 6).\nVisual identification and GIS spatial pattern analysis\nDistribution of use wears produced by visual mapping is shown inFig. 7, and their spatial anal-\nysis inTable 4.

All these tools show development of a double depression character-\nized by a concave cross section, suggesting the presence of two working areas where the nut\nwas repeatedly placed. These depressions show a centered location except on tool #43, where\nthey are closer to the edge. In addition, it is relevant to note that all depressions are located on a\nsingle horizontal plane of the blanks, indicating absence of tool rotation.\nA second group of tools is formed by two tools from the Outdoor Lab (A/H55, and A70)\nand one from the SA 8 Site (H4). At Bossou, rocks usually bear an oxide coating developed dur-\ning soil burial and on these three tools. This oxide coating is located on horizontal planes of the\nblanks, the one that will be modified as a result of the use of the blanks. The use-wear forma-\ntion process on these tools begins when, on a first stage, the oxide coating is rapidly eroded out\ndue to its friable properties, process that is abruptly interrupted when the core of the stone is\nexposed. If the activity continues, a second stage of use wear formation begins, producing a\nmodification of the crystals that form the rock matrix, with presence of microfractures along\nthe crystals. Although a large scale modification of the surface has not been identified micro-\nscopically, where the inner part of the blank is exposed there are some areas with crystal crush-\ning produced by the surface contact between the active and the passive element. Even though\nthis coating erosion areas show similar morphology to a depression, they were considered here\nFig 6. Morphometric classification of the artifacts, based on slope, roughness and TPI results.Identified morphometric features in this classification\ninclude ridges and depressions, polished areas (values of the roughness final model<0.01), and scarps (slope> 45º).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613.g006\nFirst GIS Analysis of Bossou Chimpanzees Modern Tools\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121613 March 20, 2015 10 / 22\nas a distinct group, as use wear is limited to the coating layer and does not modify the rock sur-\nface. In addition to these features, most of these tools bear impacts marks on their surfaces.\nMain characteristics of the main damage patterns are shown inTable 5. Regarding the size\nof use wear areas, the largest PA indexes are observed in tools A/H55 and A/H70, followed by\nA/H55FB and A70, while the rest of the tools have<40% PA values. This pattern is similar in\nthe largest use wear marks (LUW), where tools A70 and A/H55FB again show the highest val-\nues (LUW> 30%) (Table 4).\nThe highest values of the D index correspond to H4 and A/H55, consistently with the ED\nindex, where battered surfaces A/H55FB (ED = 1.53 cm\n-1) and A/H55 (ED = 1.12 cm-1) are\nranked first. An ED value< 0.65 cm-1 in the rest of battered surfaces indicates an overall low\ndensity of use wear. This low density is related with high elongation values; battered surfaces\nA3, H4 and A/H55 present similar elongation values (between 1.75 and 1.39), with the highest\nelongation values in A431 (elongation = 1.97) and A/H55FB (elongation = 2.50).\nWith concern to MNSH, use wear marks show similar indexes (MNSH<1.30) except in\nthree battered surfaces (A3, H4FB and A/H55 FB), with values over 1.30 suggesting the pres-\nence of marks with an elongated morphology. Mean DAC values are relatively high (DAC<4.0\ncm), although all tools possess clusters of marks with a centered location. In fact, when looking\nat the AMNC-AC index, all tools show low AMNC-AC values (<2.50 cm) except A43 (AMN-\nC-AC = 4.84 cm).\nThe DAE index yields homogeneous results, with the highest value in the battering surface\nA431 (DAE = 2.76cm), and the minimum in A/H70 (DAE = 0.62 cm). A similar pattern exists\nin the AMNC-AE index, where A3 (AMNC-AE = 6.30 cm) and A431 (AMNC-AE = 5.00 cm)\nshow the highest values. The DAE index values (see details for each tool inTable 4) show\nmarks located off center and close to the blank edges, which highlights the distribution of dam-\nage not only in the center but also around the edge of the battering surfaces (Fig. 7).\nDiscussion\nGeneral topographic characterization of battered surfaces using slope, roughness and elevation\n(S1 Fig.) group the pieces in two sets.

These internal areas usually coincide with oxide coat-\ning erosion areas, such as in pieces A/H55, A/H55FB and H4FB (Fig. 8a). Oxide coating ero-\nsions are characterized by intermediate values of slope and roughness, and show the shallowest\ndepressions (Table 7). Within the active and mixed action pieces, only artifact A/H70 differs\nsubstantially, as it is characterized by high roughness values (VRM = 0.07,Table 7) and a very\nlow frequency of lowest roughness areas. In contrast to the active/mixed pattern, passive pieces\nA3, A43 and A431 show a more disperse distribution of lowest roughness areas (Fig. 8a). Low-\nest roughness areas were 44– 55% concentrated within the depressions identified visually,\nwhich were generated by plastic deformation during battering processes. In addition, visually-\nidentified depressions match with morphometric depressions calculated using the TPI index\n(61– 77%, Table 6, Fig. 8b). In such depressed areas, scarps are abundant (Table 6) and show\nthe greatest depths (Table 7), from -2 mm to -5 mm (Fig. 8c).\nConcentric and semi-concentric lowest roughness areas also match with the impacts or bat-\ntering belts identified visually in the active and active/passive pieces A/H55, A/H55FB, H4FB\n(Fig. 8b), in some cases with statistical significance of 79.5% (piece A/H55FB,Table 6). Impact\nareas also are associated with morphometric depressions, which include partial lowest rough-\nness areas. These impact depressions are recorded in the TPI index classification (Fig. 8b),\nwhere piece H4FB bore circular morphologies (MNSH = 1.1) and significant mean depths of-2\nmm, whereas artifacts A/H55FB and H4FB show shallower elongated or irregular impact de-\npressions (depth<-0.9 mm, MNSH = 1.5). In general, impacts in active pieces produce the\nlowest mean slopes (20.8 mm,Table 7), containing low percentage of the artifact scarps (7.6%,\nTable 6).\nObserved impacts areas in the passive artifacts are scarce, and are identified only in piece\nA3 (Figs.8a and b). These impacts areas are distributed mainly around the anvil edge, and re-\nspond to a low percentage of lowest roughness areas (<4%, Table 6). These impact areas are\noften associated with elongated depressions, probably produced by fragments detached from\nthe anvil (Fig. 8b).\nPolish use wear mapped during the visual classification is limited to anvils A3 and A431. Al-\nthough these areas show low roughness (mean VRM = 0.048,Table 7), conversely they exhibit\nthe lowest percentages of lowest roughness areas (around 8.9%), high slopes (30.4º), and only\nslightly concave surfaces (Table 7). Such values are biased by the polish wear mapped in A431,\nwhich is located in the edge of the anvil.\nIn summary, our results indicate that morphometric patterns in active pieces are defined by\nhigher percentages of lowest roughness areas located in ridges, which form semiconcentric flat\nbelts that co-occur with impact marks and delimit erosion internal areas. Passive pieces tend to\nshow a more scattered distribution of lowest roughness areas, which are locally concentrated in\nbig depressions and characterized by greater depths and steeped edges. In addition, polish\nTable 5.

In addition, it is likely that the deep depressions reported in\nsome of the anvils correspond to their prolonged use life by some individual chimpanzees.\nThese and other aspects (for example, the possibility that experienced adults leave a distinct\nsignature on the tools) should be considered in future analysis, in which the morphometric\nproxies developed in this paper shall serve as the basis to interpret behavioral data retrieved\nduring etho-archaeological studies.\nThe present study has contributed to discriminate signatures of passive and active pounders,\nand to develop reliable quantitative parameters of battering damage identification that have\nbeen validated through blind tests of morphometric and visual analysis, and corroborated with\nthe behavioral data.

Long-term field studies of wild chimpanzees in the Bossou [3] and Tai forests [1]\nare providing an invaluable source of data to understand stone technology among extant pri-\nmates.

These variables can be calculated automatically, providing an accurate and objec-\ntive way to analyze morphological features and their spatial distribution in archaeological,\nexperimental and primatological stone tools. Furthermore, these methods are applicable not\nonly to meso-scale 3D scans, but also to microtopographic models, and can be used to establish\npatterns of tool damage and use wear in lithic assemblages.\nThe newly emerged field of Primate Archaeology aims establishing analytical foundations\nto interpret primate behavior from an archaeological viewpoint [6], [45], [62– 64], but much\nwork is still needed to develop appropriate comparative protocols with the archaeological re-\ncord. This paper has presented the first systematic GIS analysis of stone tools used by modern\nwild chimpanzees during nut-cracking activities, and in doing so has also provided innovative\nTable 7.
