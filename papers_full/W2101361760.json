Quality \nimprovement approaches provide a framework for measuring, assessing and improving the quality of healthcare. \nHowever, a lack of performance standards and measurement tools are an impediment to their implementation. This \npaper reports on the initial stages of development of a clinical audit tool for assessing the quality of primary health-\ncare for Australian Indigenous youth aged 12–24 including mental health services provided within primary care.\nMethods: Audit items were determined through review of relevant guidelines, expert reference group consensus \nopinion and specific inclusion criteria. Pilot testing was undertaken at four Indigenous primary healthcare services. \nA focus group discussion involving five staff from a health service participating in pilot testing explored user experi-\nences of the tool.\nResults: Audit items comprise key measures of processes and outcomes of care for Indigenous youth, as determined \nby the expert reference group. Gaps and conflicts in relevant guidelines and a lack of agreed performance indicators \nnecessitated a tool development process that relied heavily on expert reference group advice and audit item inclu-\nsion criteria. Pilot testing and user feedback highlighted the importance of feasibility and context-specific considera-\ntions in tool development and design.\nConclusions: The youth health audit tool provides a first step in monitoring, assessing and improving the way \nIndigenous primary healthcare services engage with and respond to the needs of youth. Our approach offers a way \nforward for further development of quality measures in the absence of clearly articulated standards of care.\nKeywords: Clinical audit, Quality improvement, Quality indicators, Standard of care, Adolescent health services, \nPrimary healthcare, Indigenous health\n© 2015 Puszka et al.

From the perspective \nof health services, this important life phase presents an \nopportunity for facilitating healthy lifestyles and identi -\nfying and mitigating risk factors for future ill-health [ 1]. \nHowever, there are many barriers preventing young peo -\nple from accessing health services, such as healthcare \navailability, accessibility, acceptability and equity [2].\nThe role of primary healthcare\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) provides the foundation of \nhealthcare systems internationally through key roles in \nprevention and early intervention [ 3, 4]. In some remote \nor developing contexts, PHC services may be the main \nor only healthcare providers. The frequent comorbidity \nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  Stefanie.Puszka@menzies.edu.au \n1 Menzies School of Health Research, PO Box 41096, Casuarina, NT 0810, \nAustralia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 12Puszka et al. Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \nof depression with substance misuse [5] and chronic dis -\nease [6] makes PHC an ideal avenue for prevention and \nmanagement of these conditions. Amongst PHC services \ninternationally, there is a need to establish and monitor \nstandards of care for youth [2].\nAustralian Indigenous youth health\nYoung Indigenous Australians have a higher burden of \ndisease than other Australian youth, largely attributable \nto high rates of mental illness such as anxiety and depres\n-\nsion, substance use and injuries [7]. In comparison to \ntheir non-Indigenous counterparts, Indigenous young \npeople also suffer from substantially higher rates of \nchronic conditions, including diabetes, hearing loss, skin \ndiseases, rheumatic heart disease [8], poor sexual health \n[7] and experience considerable health challenges across \na range of other indicators [7].\nHealthcare standards for Australian Indigenous youth\nIndigenous youth under-utilise health services and \nengage with healthcare at more advanced stages of illness \nand for shorter periods in comparison to non-Indigenous \nyouth [9, 10]. The quality, capacity and cultural appro\n-\npriateness of health services have been recognised as key \nfactors in engagement with services and in health out\n-\ncomes for Indigenous youth [7]. However, despite the dif-\nferent health profile of Indigenous youth and unlike some \nother areas of Indigenous health, systems for monitor\n-\ning and improving the performance of Indigenous youth \nhealth services are limited. There is no framework spe\n-\ncific to Indigenous youth and the indicator framework for \nAustralian youth health does not provide data in a format \nthat readily facilitates health system improvements, com\n-\nbining primary healthcare and hospital data. Minimal \ndata are available to monitor standards at jurisdictional, \nregional or healthcare centre levels [11].\nA need for data to help facilitate health service sys\n-\ntem improvements which are locally-relevant, culturally \nappropriate and responsive to the needs of Indigenous \nyouth has been identified from within the Indigenous \nprimary healthcare sector [12]. We were not able to iden\n-\ntify any tools for monitoring the performance of primary \nhealthcare services in Indigenous youth health in a sys\n-\ntematic search. Our aims were therefore to develop an \naudit tool for monitoring and assessing the delivery of \nhealth and wellbeing services for Indigenous youth for \nuse within a national quality improvement program.\nQuality improvement as an approach to improving service \ndelivery\nModern continuous quality improvement uses objec -\ntive information to analyse and improve health systems, \nprocesses and outcomes [13, 14]. Through our Audit \nand Best Practice for Chronic Disease projects, we have \nused a quality improvement approach to develop tools \nand processes to facilitate cycles of feedback reports and \nworkshops, goal setting, action planning and implemen\n-\ntation of systems changes within Indigenous primary \nhealthcare services (Figure  1) [15]. Over 230 Indigenous \nhealth centres across Australia have participated in \nevidence-based quality improvement processes under \nthe auspices of One21seventy—the National Centre for \nQuality Improvement in Indigenous Primary Health \nCare. The One21seventy approach to quality improve\n-\nment has been reported elsewhere [16–18].\nQuality improvement indicator development\nDonabedian [19] provides a theoretical approach to \nmeasuring quality of healthcare based on structures, \nprocesses and outcomes of care, which has been gen\n-\nerally accepted by quality improvement practitioners. \nTraditionally, the development of quality indicators has \nFigure 1 One21seventy quality improvement cycle.\nPage 3 of 12\nPuszka et al. Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \ninvolved a combination of evidence-based guidelines and \nexpert consensus. However, few published pilot and vali -\ndation studies of audit tools contain explicit information \nabout the methodology used to develop indicators or the \nassessment criteria used to evaluate them [20].\nIn a systematic review of guideline-based quality indi\n-\ncator development methods, Kötter, Blozik and Scherer \n[21] found that no gold standard for developing quality \nindicators exists. Two broad approaches to identifying \nindicators from guidelines were identified: the extraction \nof all guideline recommendations and the selection of \nindicators using a systematic expert consensus approach; \nand the selection of a limited number of guideline recom\n-\nmendations as the basis for indicators. In studies where \na limited selection of guideline recommendations were \nextracted, criteria for preselection included the size of the \nimpact on patient health; the relevance to obtaining value \nfor money; the importance to quality of healthcare pro\n-\nvided; the feasibility of monitoring; the level of evidence; \nthe grade of the recommendation; and measurability.\nAccording to Baker and Fraser [22], quality indicators \nshould be determined according to the strength of the \nevidence behind best practice guidelines and their poten\n-\ntial influence on outcomes of care. They should include \ndiagnostic and management indicators and establish real\n-\nistic standards of care; however this approach does not \ntake into account the burden of disease or stakeholder \nengagement. In contrast, Bickman [23] has advocated \nan approach based on program logic, involving the map\n-\nping of all stages of health service delivery processes to \ndevelop process-based quality indicators. The interaction \nof this method with evidence-based practice is unclear.\nAims\nThis paper describes the initial stages of development of \na tool for auditing primary healthcare services for Indige\n-\nnous youth aged 12–24. The audit tool is designed for use \nby clinical and non-clinical primary healthcare service \nstaff to audit client records and includes scheduled men\n-\ntal health services provided within primary care. Specific \nobjectives are to describe:\n  • The development of audit items using a systematic \nmethodology of identification of relevant items from \nguideline review and expert consultation; and\n  • How results from pilot testing and a user feedback \nprocess informed the further development of the \naudit tool.\nMethods\nOur methodology is consistent with an approach \ndescribed by Kötter et  al. [21] where standards of \ncare have not been pre-defined. In this method, \nevidence-based guideline recommendations are iden\n-\ntified and audit items developed using a systematic \nexpert consensus approach and explicit selection crite\n-\nria. The youth health audit tool was developed through \na process that considered factors relevant to the health \nsystem or population and health centre levels (Fig\n-\nure  2). An Expert Reference Group (ERG) was formed \nto advise on the development of a draft document. \nFindings from pilot testing and a user feedback process \ninformed further refinement in addition to consulta\n-\ntion with the ERG.\nEstablishment of expert reference group\nThe ERG determined content validity of the tool [24] \nbased on expert consensus opinion. The ERG comprised \nexpertise in Indigenous youth health from primary health\n-\ncare services and research organisations with representa -\ntives from four states and territories. The group met on \na monthly basis over an 18  month period via teleconfer\n-\nence and was facilitated by a member of the research \nteam. Terms of reference for the group were developed \nand agreed, including standard One21seventy criteria \nfor determining audit items (with minor changes for the \nIndigenous youth population). Initial inclusion criteria \nwere based on the importance of the health issue for the \nIndigenous youth population; effectiveness and appro\n-\npriateness of the assessment, intervention or service; and \n‘auditability’ or expectation of finding relevant information \nin client records and reporting on the item (Figures 2, 3).\nGroup facilitation techniques were used to achieve a \nconsensus amongst ERG members. In instances where \nmembers disagreed on the inclusion of a specific item in \nthe audit, all members were invited to outline and justify \ntheir views. Generally, disagreements were resolved with \nreference to the inclusion criteria, and particularly the \nneed to satisfy the ‘auditability’ clause.\nDevelopment and refinement\nRelevant guidelines for Indigenous youth health were \nidentified (Table 1) and used as a basis for development \nof initial audit items. For example, a national Indigenous \npreventive health guidelines recommendation to assess \nsmoking status as part of a periodic health check pro\n-\nvided the basis for an audit item to measure the propor -\ntion of clients with assessment of smoking status over the \nprevious 24 months [25].\nPilot testing\nThe performance of the tool was pilot tested at four health \ncentres in urban, regional and remote communities in the \nNorthern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and \nQueensland. The health centres included a range of organi\n-\nsation sizes and governance arrangements. At each pilot \nPage 4 of 12Puszka et al. Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \nsite, 30 client records were audited by trained auditors and \nhealth service staff. Pilot testing aimed to assess the record-\ning in client records of specific items of care and the ease \nof use of the audit tool within different paper-based and \nelectronic patient information systems. Notes and feedback \nfrom auditors were used to assess performance.\nEvidence Base \nAll relevant guidelines Health systems/ \npopula/g415on level \nAudit items \n(Table 1) \nHealth centre level \nPriority condi/g415ons & risk \nfactors\nEﬀec/g415veness & \nappropriateness of \nservice  \nIntegra/g415on with pa/g415ent \ninfo system s\nDocumenta/g415on in client  \nrecords \nFeasibility to complete \nLegend \n                Methodology  \n                Factors determini n g  audit items\nImportance of issue for \npopula/g415on \nAuditabili t y\nReasonable expecta/g415ons  \nof service deliver y\nFigure 2 Audit tool development methodology.\nOne21seventy Criteria for Determining Audit Items for the Delivery of Primary Healthcare \nto Indigenous Youth \nEver y audit it em  needs to ha ve a  speciﬁc jus/g415ﬁca/g415on fo r inclus io n. \nFor ever y item related to a  clinical or ot he r service, or a health condi/g415on, the it em  \nmust b e rel evant to an im po rtant he alth pr oble m fo r the Indigenous youth  \npopula/g415on . \nFor ever y item related to a  clinical or ot he r service, th e item s ho uld be backed by  \ngood jus/g415ﬁca /g415o n in terms of its value in assessment of health and/or social  \ncondi/g415ons, or its eﬀec/g415ven ess as an inter ven/g415 on, or i n te rm s of appropri at e fo ll ow  \nup care.  \nFor every item ther e needs to b e a re asonable expecta/g415on th at  the relevant \ninforma/g415on would be documented in the clinical re cord s of a  busy heal th cen tre,  \nand that this inf or ma /g415o n is \"auditable\" (we can re asonably expect the informa /g415o n \nto be docu men ted in a w ay  that can b e fo und in the clinical record by a per so n with  \nsome training in the audit process). \nAddi/g415onal Criteria \nAs a w ho le audit items re ﬂe ct best prac /g415ce se rv ice delivery fo r the preven/g415on,  \nscreening or tr eatment fo r risk factors and condi /g415o ns iden/g415ﬁed as priority issues for  \nthe health and wellbeing of Indigenous youth  \nFor ever y item related to a  clinical or ot he r service, th ere needs to be a reasonab le \nexpecta/g415on  that the se rvice would b e ro u/g415ne ly  provi ded if indicated.  \nFigure 3 Criteria for determining audit items for the delivery of primary healthcare to Indigenous youth.\nPage 5 of 12\nPuszka et al. Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \nUser feedback\nStaff taking part in the pilot at one site participated in a \nsemi-structured focus group discussion to explore user \nexperiences of the tool. Staff at this health service were \nundertaking a number of complementary projects relat\n-\ning to Indigenous youth health and two were represented \non the ERG. Focus group participants were required to \nhave completed at least one youth health audit using \nthe audit tool. Purposive and maximum variance sam\n-\npling [41] were employed to provide representation of a \nrange of roles and organisational levels. Five staff includ\n-\ning Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants (a man -\nager, two project officers and two quality improvement \ncoordinators) took part in a discussion of approximately \n1  h duration at the health service. The focus group was \nfacilitated by the first author using an interview guide. \nConsent was obtained from all participants through a \nwritten agreement. The focus group discussion was audio \nrecorded, transcribed and distributed to participants for \nchecking and confirmation. Results were reported to the \nERG and contributed to further refinement of the audit \ntool. Ethics approval was provided by ethics committees \nin each jurisdiction where the tool was piloted and quali\n-\ntative data was gathered.\nQualitative analysis\nFollowing a period of reflection, data were broken into \nunits of meaning and initial themes were identified and \ndiscussed by two members of the research team. Initial \nmanual data coding was conducted and the frequency \nof each theme’s appearance and its distribution across \nthe range of participants determined to identify major \nand minor themes. Initial themes were then re-assessed \nand final themes were agreed by the research team and \napplied to the data through coding. A process of thematic \nanalysis was undertaken to consider and interpret find\n-\nings. Participants were consulted about initial findings \nand given the opportunity to contribute to further analy\n-\nsis through circulation of a draft manuscript.\nResults\nAudit tool content\nThe audit tool comprises items under the headings: gen -\neral information; attendance at health centre; recording \nof key health information; scheduled immunisations; \nprotective factors, risk factors, brief interventions and \nreferral; scheduled services and follow up. A key compo\n-\nnent is a section on psychosocial concerns based on the \nHEEADSS (Home environment, Education and employ\n-\nment, Eating and diet, Activities and peer relationships, \nDrugs and alcohol, Sexual behaviour risks, Suicide and \nemotional wellbeing) assessment, an internationally \naccepted youth psychosocial assessment tool recom\n-\nmended by national guidelines for Indigenous youth [25, \n41]. Cultural engagement and gambling were added to \nthe HEEADSS items following recommendation from \nthe ERG. Other items added to the audit tool following \nERG advice were assessments of mature minor status \nTable 1 Guidelines for youth health in Indigenous primary healthcare\nTopic Guidelines\nGeneral National Guide to a Preventive Health Assessment in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples [25]\nMBS Health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (MBS Item 715) [26]\nCentral Australian Rural Practitioners Association Standard Treatment Manual [27]\nMinymaku Kutju Tjukurpa—Women’s Business Manual [28]\nQueensland Health and the Royal Flying Doctor Service Queensland Section Primary Clinical Care Manual [29]\nSexual health Minymaku Kutju Tjukurpa—Women’s Business Manual [28]\nQueensland Sexual Health Clinical Management Guidelines [30]\nNational Management Guidelines for Sexually Transmissible Infections [31]\nWA Department of Health Guidelines for Managing Sexually Transmitted Infections [32]\nAlcohol and other drugs Alcohol Treatment Guidelines for Indigenous Australians [33]\nClinical Guidelines and Procedures for the Use of Methadone in the Maintenance Treatment of Opioid Dependence [34]\nNational Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Dependence [35]\nProcesses of care Interpretive Guide of the RACGP Standards for General Practice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Services [36]\nOthers Recommendations for Clinical Care Guidelines on the Management of Otitis Media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \nPopulations [37]\nDiagnosis and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia—an evidence-based review \n[38]\nNational Physical Activity Guidelines [39]\nQueensland Chronic Disease Guidelines [40]\nPage 6 of 12Puszka et al. Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \nand client consent. Audit items assess processes of care \n(including documentation of key client information), or \na combination of processes and outcomes (for example, \ncombining assessment of client risk status and the result \nof the risk assessment) (Table 2); assessment of the struc\n-\nture of care is dealt with separately in the One21seventy \nprocess through systems assessment (Figure 1).\nThe audit tool underwent four major phases of devel\n-\nopment as the ERG considered an initial draft and results \nfrom pilot testing and user feedback processes (Figure  4). \nTime taken to complete the audit and user feedback on \nthe length of the tool provided impetus to further pri\n-\noritise audit items. The original One21seventy criteria \nfor determining the inclusion of audit items (Figure  3) \nrequired refinement for the purpose of the youth health \naudit tool. Further prioritisation of audit items was deter\n-\nmined by the ERG according to best practice service \ndelivery for the prevention, screening or treatment for \nrisk factors and conditions identified as priority issues for \nthe health and wellbeing of Indigenous youth and consid\n-\nerations of what could be reasonably expected of health \nservice practice and documentation, in addition to the \noriginal criteria (Figure 2). As a result, some psychosocial \nitems were included in a briefer format and grouped as a \n‘lifestyle discussion’ , which included home environment, \neducation, employment, activities and peer relationships, \ndiet and eating, gambling and cultural engagement; and \nin the scheduled services section, items relating to follow \nup of abnormal findings were grouped as ‘actions taken’ . \nSome other items that were not well documented in cli\n-\nent records and which the ERG advised were unlikely to \nbe specifically documented were removed, including dis\n-\ncussion of contraception and physical development.\nGaps and conflicts in relevant guidelines for Indige -\nnous youth health and a lack of agreed standards of care \nnecessitated revision. In the final version of the tool, the \nERG agreed to follow national Indigenous preventive \nhealth guidelines [25]. A lack of standard terminology of \ncomponents of care delivery, particularly relating to psy\n-\nchosocial issues such as brief interventions and social or \ncultural treatments required further consideration, dis\n-\ncussion and advice from the ERG and specification in the \nprotocol.\nPilot testing\nThe audit tool was generally found to be straightfor -\nward to use within different paper-based and electronic \npatient information systems. Ease of use was facilitated \nwhere health services had adopted standard ways and \nlocations for recording information in client files across \npractitioners. It was less time consuming to complete in \nhealth services with standard recording protocols, in ser\n-\nvices which stored client information only in electronic \nsystems (without supplementing with paper-based \nrecords) and where electronic systems included a specific \ntab for recording psychosocial information.\nUser feedback\nScope and content\nA major theme of the focus group discussion was the \nscope and content of the audit tool. While there was a \nconsensus amongst participants that the audit tool was \nnot able to measure client engagement, there was discus\n-\nsion about the need to broaden the scope to determine \nwhether unmet standards of care reflected client choice \nor quality of the service offered, as illustrated:\n… so what are you trying to measure, the uptake or \nalso the quality of the care being offered [e.g.: for STI \nscreening], so you’ve got a tick for being offered, but \nwe also know they’re not being screened and if you \nsee, you know 50% of people have… refused it, is it \nbecause of the way they’re being offered, so do we \nneed to look at how people are asking/offering that \nthing, or is it because there is some other thing hap\n-\npening in the community where they don’t want to \nbe part of that?\nParticipants discussed the scope of the audit eligibil\n-\nity criteria, disagreeing on whether including clients \nwith chronic conditions would bias results. Feedback on \nthe content of the audit tool included comments on the \naddition of items (main health service attended, chronic \nconditions care plan), amendments to items (separating \ndiet and physical activity, including internal referrals in \nreferral items) and the deletion of items (medication for \neating problems, recording of client information in paper \nrecords). At the same time there were some general con\n-\ncerns expressed about the length of the tool.\nPotential implications for service delivery\nThe ways in which audit data may inform service delivery \nwas a central aspect of the discussion. Participants dis\n-\ncussed how data on clients not attending appointments \nor declining treatment or referrals may lead to further \ninvestigation:\nThat [clients not attending referral services] might \nhave to be something that as a service we look at…\nThe potential for data on reports received from referral \nservices to lead to greater communication with external \norganisations was also discussed:\n…there’s very low communication that exists, so \nthat’s what’s designed to help highlight and then you \ncan help prioritise for yourselves if that’s what you \nwant to target, help to increase it…\nPage 7 of 12\nPuszka et al.

Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \nIn the context of a move towards electronic systems \nand shared electronic health records, this was thought to \nbe particularly pertinent.\nParticipants discussed how audit data could inform \nstrategies for improved service delivery and outcomes \nfor clients with chronic conditions. The potential for the \naudit to provide information on their general care includ\n-\ning psychosocial screening was highlighted, as illustrated:\n…it might tell us whether the care was focussed on \nthat condition rather than being, you know, covering \nall of the other psychosocial areas, because having \ndone some of the audits that’s what I saw…\nQuality of documentation in client records\nDiscussion of the quality of documentation in client \nrecords identified some challenging issues. Although it \nwas acknowledged that appropriate documentation was a \ncomponent of best practice care, there was a concern that \nsome audit items were not well documented and may be \ndifficult to audit. Inconsistencies in the recording of non-\nclinical items such as referrals, reports received from \nreferral services and mature minor assessments were \nidentified. The potential for the audit to extend to other \ndatabases for the purposes of searching for referral infor\n-\nmation and immunisations was explored.\nTable 2 continued\nAudit Item Measure type Likely documentation in client \nrecord\nFrequency of reporting\n Sexual health check Process/outcome Service items As part of annual health check or symp-\ntomatically\n Sexual health actions taken Process (service delivery) Service items or recalls As indicated\nEvidence Base \nVersion 1\nAddi/g415ons \nTransgender op/g415on  \nOther services accessed  \nClient loca/g415on in community \nHealth professionals seen by \nClient consent  \nMature minor status \nSocial emo/g415onal wellbeing: add \ngambling \nSocial emo/g415onal wellbeing ac/g415o ns\ntaken  \nFormat/repor/g415ng changes \nimmunisa/g415ons \nDele/g415ons \nLoca/g415on of recording \n(paper/electronic)\nVersion 2\nAddi/g415ons \nContracep/g415on  \nSuicide and self harm \nFormat/repor/g415ng changes \nMature minor status simpliﬁed \nSocial emo/g415onal wellbeing  \nexpanded \nImmunisa/g415on – dates/numbers  \nDele/g415ons \nQualita/g415ve ques/g415ons eg: long te rm\nhealth condi/g415on, reason for \na/g425endance, client loca/g415on in \ncommunity \nVersion 3\nVersion 4\nAddi/g415ons \nPhysical development  \nClient declined service op/g415on \nLong term health condi/g415on \nmanagement plan \nFormat/repor/g415ng changes \nHealth check simpl iﬁed \nSocial emo/g415onal wellbeing \nsimpliﬁed  \nOther services changed to other \nregular primary healthcare  \nSeparate diet & ea/g415ng, physical  \nexercise  \nTobacco discussion to tobacco us e\nImmunisa/g415ons – reﬂect varying \nstate-based schedules \nChange external service to referra l\nservice \nDele/g415ons \nUp to date summary \nFewer social emo/g415onal wellbeing \nscreenin gt ools\nVersion 4\nFormat/repor/g415ng changes \nConsent speciﬁc to health check \nImmunisa/g415ons simpliﬁed  \nScheduled services – ac/g415ons tak en\nsimpliﬁed  \nDele/g415ons \nSocial emo/g415onal wellbeing limited\nto key areas: tobacco, alcohol,  \nother drugs & substances, sexual \nac/g415vity and risk, emo/g415onal \nwellbeing  \nOther social emo/g415onal wellbeing \ngrouped as ‘lifestyle discussion’ \nFigure 4 Audit tool development process.\nPage 10 of 12Puszka et al. Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \nTerminology and definitions\nInconsistent terminology in client records was identi -\nfied as posing a further potential impediment to the audit \nprocess. The challenges of auditing psychosocial assess -\nments were highlighted as participants discussed how \nto define items in the audit protocol. Greater clarity in \ndefinitions of brief interventions, reports received from \nreferral services, long term health conditions, up to date \nhealth summaries, clients screened at risk, weight man\n-\nagement plans and psychosocial assessments was recom -\nmended. Participants generally felt that terminology used \nwithin the audit tool should not be overly clinical and be \nconsistent with other One21seventy audit tools for ease \nof use, particularly by non-clinical staff.\nDiscussion\nTool development and refinement\nConsistent with Kötter et al. [21], our process combined \nextraction of evidence-based guidelines with expert opin\n-\nion and specific inclusion criteria. An important refine -\nment was our pragmatic approach in seeking advice on \nthe priority audit items and exploring feasibility issues \nwith stakeholders through the ERG and end user focus \ngroup processes.\nThe importance of considering feasibility issues and \nthe need to balance the breadth of items with length \nwere highlighted by both the ERG and user feedback \nprocesses. The original One21seventy criteria for devel\n-\noping audit tools (Figure  3) were found to be insufficient \nfor determining items in the youth health audit tool. Fur -\nther prioritisation of audit items was determined by the \nERG according to best practice service delivery for the \nprevention, screening or treatment for risk factors and \nconditions identified as priority issues for the health and \nwellbeing of Indigenous youth and reasonable expecta\n-\ntions of health services in the documentation and deliv -\nery of care, in addition to the original criteria (Figure  2). \n‘Reasonable expectations’ primarily related to the record-\ning of information in client records and the extent of \ncommunication and follow up with referral agencies that \ncould reasonably be expected of health services, given \nresource constraints. It was felt that this approach would \nenable an adequate assessment of health service perfor\n-\nmance whilst avoiding setting unattainable standards.\nThe user feedback process demonstrated the ability of \nthe audit tool to educate health service staff about stand -\nards of care and to facilitate reflective practice through \nboth the processes of auditing individual client records \nand the interpretation of summary results. Some audit \nitems (particularly psychosocial items) were therefore \nretained in the audit tool despite poor documentation \nin client records in order to provide opportunities for \nimprovement through staff education and reflection. \nAppropriate documentation of care is an important com\n-\nponent of quality improvement and a legal and ethical \nissue. Poorly documented items are not graphed in the \naudit report provided to health services in order to avoid \nmisinterpretation, but presented in tabular format with \nappropriate commentary on interpretation.\nLimitations\nFor purposes of brevity and feasibility, the audit tool only \nassesses guideline-specified prevention, screening and \ntreatment for certain risk factors and conditions priori\n-\ntised by the ERG. It was not possible to establish criterion \nvalidity due to the absence of a ‘gold standard’ compari\n-\nson to our process [21]. User feedback was only sought \nthrough a focus group discussion at one health service, \nbut was combined with auditor notes from pilot testing \nat four sites and interpreted by the ERG which repre\n-\nsented a range of health services. Audit results and inter-\nrater reliability from pilot testing are not reported in this \nmanuscript as they do not directly relate to its scope but \nmay be reported elsewhere. Further testing of the perfor\n-\nmance and reliability of the tool is needed.\nImplications\nIn the context of no articulated standards of care, it is \npossible to develop an audit process premised on evi\n-\ndence-based guidelines but the justification for each \naudit item must be explicit and realistic. Our experience \nwas that engagement with stakeholders and experts and \nthe use of selection criteria for audit items were pivotal \nin determining key measures of quality; and that a prag\n-\nmatic approach that considered feasibility and reason -\nable expectations of health services, given constrained \nresources and the fragmented nature of referral services, \nwas needed. We would recommend that the future devel\n-\nopment of such tools incorporate these processes and \ncontext-specific considerations while allowing further \nrefinement post-implementation.\nWe expect that audits of youth health service delivery \nwill encourage a greater focus on youth health amongst \nprimary healthcare services, an area often overlooked, \nand in particular greater attention to screening, assess\n-\nment and treatment of psychosocial issues. Results \nfrom the youth health audit may be of interest to poli\n-\ncymakers in designing and supporting primary health -\ncare delivery models appropriate for Indigenous youth. \nAs there are currently no clearly articulated standards \nof care specific to Indigenous youth health, policy\n-\nmakers may be interested in the final set of measures \nincluded in the audit tool if sector-wide reporting \nmetrics and performance standards are developed for \nIndigenous youth health in future. Further research is \nneeded to investigate the implementation of the audit \nPage 11 of 12\nPuszka et al. Int J Ment Health Syst  (2015) 9:28 \ntool and the nature and extent of any improvements to \nthe quality of care for youth following successive cycles \nof use.\nConclusions\nWe found that developing robust measures of quality \nfor primary healthcare for Indigenous youth required a \npragmatic methodology which was specific, yet flexible. \nA lack of clearly articulated standards of care, along \nwith gaps and conflicts in guidelines for evidence-based \npractice, ensured that expert consensus played a funda\n-\nmental role in determining audit items. Clear criteria \nwere needed to guide expert consensus, but the ability \nto further refine criteria enabled the Expert Reference \nGroup to respond to issues raised in pilot testing and \nuser feedback processes.\nFindings from pilot testing and user feedback pro\n-\ncesses, that the tool was generally user friendly but \nimpractical in length, facilitated additional prioritisation \nof audit items by the Expert Reference Group and hence \nenabled the tool to be further refined. Other feasibility \nissues raised in these processes, including variable docu\n-\nmentation of some services in client records and limits to \nthe ability of practitioners to follow up referral services, \nhighlighted the need for the Expert Reference Group to \nconsider reasonable expectations for health services in \ndocumenting and delivering care and avoiding setting \nunattainable standards, given resource constraints. How\n-\never, the user testing process also demonstrated how \nthe audit could help educate staff about best practice \nand provide an opportunity for reflective practice, sug\n-\ngesting a need to balance these functions with the fea -\nsibility issues described when establishing performance \nmeasures.\nTo our knowledge, the youth health audit tool repre\n-\nsents the first attempt at developing such a resource. Fur-\nther testing of the performance and reliability of the tool \nis needed. However, we hope that through incorporation \nin quality improvement processes such as the One21sev\n-\nenty program, the youth health audit tool will provide a \nfirst step in monitoring, assessment and improvement in \nthe way Indigenous primary healthcare services engage \nwith and respond to the needs of youth.\nAuthors’ contributions\nSP coordinated the ERG, carried out pilot testing, analysed qualitative data and \ndeveloped a draft version of the manuscript.
