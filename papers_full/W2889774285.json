  "abstract": "Corrosive sulfides in transformer oil could react with copper wire to produce cuprous sulfide, causing insulation failure. At present, both the quantitative measurement method and distribution of sulfur components in operating oil are not clear yet. In this paper, the existing types and contents of sulfides in oil samples with different alkyl groups and different voltage levels were investigated. With quantitative testing methods, the distribution of sulfur composition in the operating oil was analyzed. Results showed that the thiophene sulfide in transformer oil existed mainly in the form of benzothiophene with an unsaturation of 6 and dibenzothiophene with an unsaturation of 9. The content of monosulfide sulfide with unsaturation of 3 or 6 was the highest. The disulfide existed basically in the form of Dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS). The influence of sulfides on the oil quality were analyzed on this basis. Results showed that the existence of sulfides would increase the moisture content in oil. The absorbed moisture could cause the decrease of the breakdown voltage and rise of the dielectric loss. The above study could provide some engineering practice for understanding the sulphide distribution in transformer oils and further prevent the sulfur corrosion faults.",
