This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nSummary The Hawaiian crow has been revealed as a skilled\ntool user, confirmed by testing the last members of this endan-\ngered species that survive in captivity. The finding suggests its\nbehavior is tantalizingly similar to that of the famous tool-\nusing New Caledonian crow and has implications for the evo-\nlution of tool use and intelligence in birds.\nKeywords Tool use . Comparative cognition . Corvid\nTool use is often singled out as a defining feature of humanity.\nHowever, many other animals have independently evolved\ntechnological skills. They are phylogenetically widespread yet\noccur at low frequency within different animal groups. Why\nshould some species evolve tool use but not others? Various\npreconditions are proposed: cognitive, environmental, anatom-\nical, behavioral, and genetic. Primates and birds probably\nshared some key features that enabled their tool skills to evolve\nin parallel. Intelligence, behavioral flexibility, and innovation\nare just a few possibilities. Corvids, with relatively large brains\nand impressive cognitive abilities, are prime candidates to\nevolve technology. One such corvid is the New Caledonian\ncrow (Corvus moneduloides), whose tool-making talents rival\nthose of our close relatives (Hunt & Uomini, 2016).\nRutz et al. ( 2016) report that the Hawaiian crow ( Corvus\nhawaiiensis) is also a tool-using spec ies. Sadly, the Hawaiian\ncrow is extinct in the wild. The world ’s population is sustained\nin two breeding facilities in the hope they can eventually return\nto the wild. From previous wor k with New Caledonian crows,\nRutz and colleagues predicted in 2011 that Hawaiian crows\nshould be tool users (Rutz & St Clair, 2012). Meanwhile, the\nHawaiian crow keepers had commonly observed tool use in\ntheir crows. They began collaborating in 2012. The fact that\nthis publication was 4 years in the making testifies to the exten-\nsive research the team carried out to explore some of the key\nfactors underpinning Hawaiian crow tool use. We focus here on\ninnovation, genetic basis, and social transmission.\nRutz et al. ( 2016) tested captive Hawaiian crows with the\nsame tool-use tasks as those given to New Caledonian crows:\nnatural logs with meat in holes that could only be reached with\nsuitably long tools. About 90% of adult crows and 40% of juve-\nniles used twigs to successfully extract the food (81 of 104 birds).\nT h eb i r d sw e r eq u i c kt op i c ku pt w i g sa n ds o l v et h et a s k .T h e\nvideos show that adult crows chose tools of appropriate length or\nshortened overly long twigs. However, unlike New Caledonian\ncrows, the Hawaiian crows did not appear to standardize their\ntools, as they used plant materials of many sizes and shapes.\nThe Hawaiian crows were already familiar with tools, for\nexample to fish food from the ir water bowls with sticks.\nBecause tool use is known only in these captive birds, it is\npossible that the behavior was an innovation by one or more\nsmart birds. Such innovation was documented in a crow rela-\ntive that does not use tools in the wild, the rook ( Corvus\nfrugilegus), which spontaneously used tools to get food in\ncaptivity. However, that most adult Hawaiian crows success-\nfully solved the log task suggested an inherited disposition for\ntool use, similar to that in the New Caledonian crow.\nTo find out if Hawaiian crows ’technological skills had a\ngenetic basis, Rutz et al. (2016) reared seven juveniles deprived\nof social contact to other tool users (crow and human). These\njuveniles readily manipulated o bjects and tried to reach inac-\ncessible food with them. However, they spent less time\n* Natalie Uomini\ntraduck@gmail.com\n1 Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Kahlaische\nStrasse 10, 07745 Jena, Germany\n2 238 Meola Road, Auckland 1022, New Zealand\nLearn Behav (2017) 45:205 –206\nDOI 10.3758/s13420-017-0262-5\n\nmanipulating objects than New Caledonian crows and non-\ntool-using ravens (Corvus corax) of the same age did and did\nnot show the stereotyped probing behaviors preceding func-\ntional tool use seen in New Caledonian crows. After the exper-\nimenters provided sticks and made the holes easier to access,\nthree crows made 13 successful probes (out of 96 attempts in\nthe new setup). Only one juvenile made repeated successful\nfood extractions using tools by the end of the 5.5 month study\nperiod. These findings show that Hawaiian crows have a rudi-\nmentary genetic predisposition to use tools. Because New\nCaledonian crows take 1 to 2 yea rs to reach adult proficiency\nwith tools, it will be interesting to study the ontogeny of tool use\nin Hawaiian crows over a similar time period.\nAlthough naïve juveniles are able to independently develop\ntool use, their mixed success at extracting food with tools left\nopen the possibility that the widespread tool skills in the cap-\ntive population were invented by clever birds and then spread\nby social learning. To test this directly, Rutz et al. ( 2016)d i da\nnifty bit of social network modeling of long-term data in the\ncrows’housing group histories. The captive breeding program\nbegan in 1970. Using detailed records from 1996 to 2013,\nRutz et al. ( 2016) determined which pairs of birds were in\nvisual contact at any time and simulated the learning pathways\nleading from each current tool user back in time. Their com-\nputer model calculated how many crows would have had to\ninnovate tool use over the years in order for all current 74 tool\nusers (excluding the seven naïve juveniles) to have socially\nlearned tool use. If learning occurs every time a juvenile ob-\nserves an adult, eight independent innovation events would\nhave been required. Thus, it was unlikely that tool use was\nrepeatedly invented in the captive population and spread by\nsocial transmission alone. Even if the nine wild-caught crows\nwho founded the original captive population had socially ob-\ntained tool skills in the wild, it is more parsimonious that the\nwidespread behavior in the current population is underpinned\nby an inherited disposition specifically for tool use.\nIf Hawaiian crows indeed used tools in the wild, we have a\nwindow into their minds. Hunt, Gray, and Taylor ( 2013)p r o -\nposed three cognitive capacities required for flexible tool use\nin birds. First, a bird needs to learn that an object can be used\nto solve a problem. Second, it must have the working memory\nto deal with the procedural complexity involved in tool use.\nThird, it must acquire the motor skills to manipulate a tool in a\ncontrolled way. The videos published by Rutz et al. ( 2016)\nsuggest that adult Hawaiian crows clearly understand the\nproblem (the food is in the hole) and the solution (use a stick\nto get the food out). However, the way Hawaiian crows treat\ntheir tools offers a possible clue to their working memory\ncapacity. They do not appear to safeguard their tools. After\neach probe, they drop the tool before pecking at the food. In\ncontrast, New Caledonian crows usually safeguard their tools\nin between probes by deliberately and carefully trapping them\nunder a foot, on a branch, or in a hole. The difference could be\nrelated to working memory, motivation, or necessity (e.g.,\nalthough New Caledonian crows retain their tools even near\nthe ground, Hawaiian crows might safeguard their tools if\nusing them high above ground). Although adult Hawaiian\ncrows succeed at getting food with tools, they appear to lack\nthe refined tool control with the bill that is a hallmark of New\nCaledonian crows. This might be due to their curved bill,\ncontrasting with the New Caledonian crow ’s straight bill\nwhich makes tool manipulation more efficient. In sum, even\nif a species understands the advantage of tool use, sufficient\nworking memory and manipulation skill are probably impor-\ntant for long-term maintenance of the behavior.\nIt is always exciting when an animal species is shown to\nhave tool-using abilities. The Hawaiian crow joins the 170 bird\nspecies that can use simple tools in captivity and/or in the wild.\nThe species is clearly innovativ e with an inherited disposition\nfor functional object manipulation. It will be difficult to show\nconclusively that the Hawaiian crow habitually made and used\ntools in the wild, or evolved any technological traditions. We\nhope ongoing research will investigate aspects such as life\nhistory, social learning, and foraging behavior to help answer\nthese questions. The Rutz et al. ( 2016) study opens up exciting\nprospects for future comparative work on the evolution of avian\ntool use, for instance, on bill morphology, binocular vision,\nmanipulation precision, cognitive abilities, brain size, and ge-\nnetic underpinnings. It might also help answer the question of\nwhy avian tool use is more likely to evolve on tropical islands.\nIs it because of reduced competition for embedded prey and\nlow predation, as the authors suggest, or extreme seasonality in\nthe abundance of nonembedded prey that motivates a clever\nbird to use tools to get embedded prey in hard times?\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use,\ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appro-\npriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.
