The code is pub-\nlicly available at https://github.com/VT-NLP/\nSyntax-Guided-Graph-Transformer.\n1 Introduction\nTemporal relationship, e.g., Before, After, and Si-\nmultaneous, is important for understanding the\nprocess of complex events and reasoning over\nthem. Extracting temporal relationship automat-\nically from text is thus an important component in\nmany downstream applications, such as summariza-\ntion (Jiang et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2014), dialog un-\nderstanding and generation (Ritter et al., 2010; Sun\net al., 2021), reading comprehension (Harabagiu\nand Bejan, 2005; Sun et al., 2018; Ning et al., 2020;\nHuang et al., 2019) and future event prediction (Li\net al., 2021; Lin et al., 2022). While event mentions\ncan often be detected reasonably well (Lin et al.,\n2020; Huang and Ji, 2020; Wang et al., 2021, 2022),\nextracting event-event relationships, especially tem-\nporal relationship, still remains challenging (Chen\net al., 2021).\nTemporal Relation (e1     e2): Before \nS2:  Mr. Erdogan' s office (e 1 :  said ) he had (e 2 :  accepted ) the apology\n, \" In the name of the Turkish people \".  \nS3:  \"The desk thing really (e 1 :  stuck ) with me \", Ms. Ayotte (e 2 :  said ).  \nTemporal Relation (e1     e2): Before \nS1:  Now, Lockheed Martin which (e 1 :  bought ) an early version of\nsuch a computer from the Canadian company D-Wave systems two\nyears ago is confident enough in the technology to upgrade it to\ncommercial scale, becoming the first company to (e 2 :  use ) quantum\ncomputing as part of its business.\nbought r elcl Matin is becomingadvcl attr company use nsubj r elcl \nTemporal Relation (e1     e2): AFTER \nFigure 1: Examples of temporal relation annotations.\nEvent mentions are boldfaced, the temporal relations\nbetween these events are listed below each sentence,\nand the temporal cues deciding those temporal relations\nare highlighted in red.\nRecent studies (Han et al., 2019b; Ning et al.,\n2017; Vashishtha et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a)\nhave shown improved performance in temporal re-\nlation extraction by leveraging the contextual repre-\nsentations learned from pre-trained language mod-\nels (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). However,\none remaining challenge of this task is that it re-\nquires accurate characterization of the connection\nbetween two event mentions and the cues indicat-\ning their temporal relationship, especially when the\ncontext is wide and complicated. For instance, by\nmanually examining 200 examples of human anno-\ntated temporal relations from the MATRES (Ning\net al., 2018) dataset, we find that about 52% of the\ntemporal cues1 come from the connection between\ntwo event mentions (e.g., S1 in Fig. 1), 39% from\ntheir surrounding contexts (S2 in Fig. 1) and the\nremaining 9% from others, e.g., event co-reference\nor subordinate clause structures (S3 in Fig. 1).\n1Temporal cues refer to the words of which the seman-\ntic meaning or related syntactic relations can determine the\ntemporal relation of two event mentions.\n379\nGraph Attention Over Ingoing and\nOutgoing Edges\nIngoingHe won the Gusher\nNo Yes No No\n...\nN\nN N\nGraph\nAttention\nSource\nNode\nNeighbor\nNode\nSource\nNode\nTarget\nNodePath Neighbor Node\nSyntax-guided Attention  \nover Src-To-Tar Path\nOutgoing\nAggregated Temporal\nInformation\nFusion of Event Node\nRepresentations\nTemporal Query\nEvent Detection\nhs hst hst ht\nhst\nwon finishing\nRepresentation \n of won\nRepresentation\nof finishing\nTemporal Relation Extraction Module\nht\nhswon\nInput  \nSentence\nBERT \nLayer\nthe\nGusher\nMarathon,\nfinishing\nin\n3:07:35\nHe\nEvent  \nExtraction \nModule\nSyntax-guided Graph Transformer\nEEM Linear\nFusion Layer\nFeed Forward Layer\nAdd &\nLayerNorm\nAdd &\nLayerNorm\nSyntax-guided\nAttention\nGraph  \nMulti-Head  \nAttention \nEncoder Stack\nInput Graph Structure\nHe wontheGusherMarathon,finishingin 3:07:35\nnsubj\nadvcl\ncompound\ndobj\ndet\nprep\npobj\nResidual\nConnection\nFigure 2: Architecture overview. The tokens highlighted with red and blue colors in the Input Sentence show\nthe source and target events to be detected. The bold edges in the Input Graph Structure indicate the triples from\nthe dependency path between the source and target event mentions as well as their surrounding context, and are\nconsidered by the syntax-guided attention.\nSyntactic features, such as dependency parsing\ntrees, have proved to be effective in characterizing\nthe connection of two event mentions in pre-neural\nmethods (Chambers, 2013; Chambers et al., 2014;\nMirza and Tonelli, 2016). However, how to make\nuse of these features has been under-explored since\nthe adoption of neural methods in this field. This\npaper closes this gap with a novel Syntax-guided\nGraph Transformer (SGT) network – in addition to\nthe attention heads in a typical Graph Transformer,\nwe bring in a new attention mechanism that specif-\nically looks at the path from a source node to a\ntarget node over dependency parsing trees. SGT\nthus not only learns event representations as in\na typical Graph Transformer, but also provides a\nway to represent syntactic dependency informa-\ntion between a pair of events (for temporal relation\nextraction, this means attending to the aforemen-\ntioned temporal cues). We conduct experiments\non two benchmark datasets, MATRES (Ning et al.,\n2018) and TB-D ENSE (Cassidy et al., 2014) on\nboth end-to-end temporal relation extraction and\nclassification, which demonstrate the effectiveness\nof SGT over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ex-\nperiments on the contrast set (Gardner et al., 2020)\nof MATRES further proves the robustness of our\napproach.\n2 Approach\nFigure 2 shows the overview of our approach.\nGiven an input sentence ˜s= [w1,w2,...,w n] with\nntokens, we aim to detect a set of event mentions\n{e1,e2,...}where each event mention ei may con-\ntain one or multiple tokens by leveraging the con-\ntextual representations learned from a pre-trained\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2018) encoder. Then, fol-\nlowing previous studies (Ning et al., 2019, 2017;\nHan et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2020a), we consider\neach pair of event mentions that are detected from\none or two continuous sentences, and predict their\ntemporal relationship.\nTo effectively capture the temporal cues between\ntwo event mentions, we build a dependency graph\nfrom one or two input sentences and design a new\nSyntax-guided Graph Transformer network to au-\ntomatically learn a new contextual representation\nfor each event mention by considering the triples\nthat they are locally involved as well as the triples\nalong the dependency path of the two event men-\ntions within the dependency graph. Finally, the two\nevent mention representations are concatenated to\npredict their temporal relationship.\n380\n2.1 Sequence Encoder\nGiven an input sentence ˜s = [w1,w2,...,w n], we\napply the same tokenizer as BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2018) to get all the subtokens. Then, we feed the\nsequence of subtokens as input to a pre-trained\nBERT model to get a contextual representation for\neach token wi. If a token wi is split into multiple\nsubtokens, we use the contextual representation of\nthe first subtoken to represent wi. To enrich the\ncontextualized representations, for each token, we\ncreate a one-hot Part-of-Speech (POS) tag vector\nand concatenate it with BERT contextual embed-\ndings. In this way, we obtain a final representation\nci2 for each wi. These representations will be later\nused for event mention detection and also as the\ninitial representations to our syntax-guided graph\ntransformer network.\n2.2 Event Detection\nTo detect event mentions from the sentence, we\ntake the contextual representation of each word\nas input to a binary linear classifier to determine\nwhether it is an event mention or not, which is op-\ntimized by minimizing the following binary cross-\nentropy loss:\n˜yi = softmax(Weveci + beve)\nLeve = −\n∑\n˜s∈S\n|˜s|∑\ni=1\n∑\nπ∈{0,1}\nαπyi,πlog(˜yi,π)\nwhere Leve denotes the cross-entropy loss for event\ndetection. Sis the set of sentences in the training\ndataset. απ is a weight coefficient for each class (0\nor 1) to mitigate the data imbalance problem and\nα0 + α1 = 1. yi,π is a binary indicator to show\nwhether π is the same as the groundtruth binary\nlabel (yi,π = 1) or not (yi,π = 0). ˜yi,π denotes the\nprobability of the i-th token in sbeing predicted\nwith a binary class label π. Weve and beve are\nlearnable parameters.\n2.3 Syntax-guided Graph Transformer\nFrom the example sentences in Fig. 1, the temporal\ncues for characterizing the temporal relationship be-\ntween two event mentions mainly come from their\nsurrounding contexts as well as their connections\nfrom their syntactic dependency path. However,\na sequence encoder usually fails to capture such\ninformation, especially when the context between\n2We use bold lower case symbols to denote vectors.\ntwo event mentions is complicated, thus we further\ndesign a new Syntax-guided Graph Transformer\n(SGT) network.\nGiven a source event es and a target event et\ndetected from one or two continuous sentences, we\napply a public dependency parser 3 to parse each\nsentence into a tree-graph and connect the graphs\nof two continuous sentences with an arbitrarycross-\nsentence edge (Peng et al., 2017; Cheng and Miyao,\n2017) pointing from the root node of the preceding\nsentence to the root node of the following one, and\nobtain a graph G= (V,E).For each node vi, we\nuse Nin\ni = {(vk,rki,vi) ∈E|vk,vi ∈V}and\nNout\ni = {(vi,rij,vj) ∈E|vi,vj ∈V}to denote\nall the neighbor triples of vi with in-going and out-\ngoing edges respectively, r ∈Υ where Υ is the\nlabel set for syntactic dependency relation, and use\nPij = {(vi,rig,vg),..., (vh,rhj,vj)}as the triple\nset along the path from vi to vj.\nNode Representation Initialization For each\nnode vi in graph G, we map it to a particular token\nwi′ from the original sentence and obtain a con-\ntextual representation ci′ from the BERT encoder.\nThen, we learn an initial node representation for\neach node vi as:\nh0\ni = Weci′ + be\nwhere We and be are learnable parameters.\nGraph Multi-head Self-attention Following\ntransformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017; Wang\net al., 2020b), we adapt the multi-head self-\nattention to learn a contextual representation for\neach node in the graph G. Each node vi in graph\nG is associated with a set of neighbor triples\nNin\ni ∪Nout\ni and a node representation hl−1\ni where\nlis the index of a layer in our transformer archi-\ntecture. To perform self-attention, we first apply\na linear transformation to obtain a query vector\nbased on each node vi, and employ another two lin-\near transformations to get the key and value vectors\nbased on the node’s neighbor triples:\nQl\ni = Wm\nq hl−1\ni\nKl\nij = Wm\nk Rl−1\nij\nUl\nij = Wm\nu Rl−1\nij\nRl−1\nij = Wm\nr (hl−1\ni\n/hugeparallel\nrij\n/hugeparallel\nhl−1\nj ) + bm\nr\nwhere m is the index of a particular head. Ql\ni\ndenotes a query vector corresponding to node vi,\n3https://spacy.io/api/dependencyparser\n381\nKl\nij and Ul\nij is a key and value vector respec-\ntively, and both of them are learned from a triple\n(vi,rij,vj) ∈Nin\ni ∪Nout\ni , which is represented as\nRij. mis the index of a particular head. /bigparalleldenotes\nthe concatenation operation. rij denotes the repre-\nsentation of a particular relation rij between vi and\nvj, which is randomly initialized and optimized\nby the model. Wm\nq , Wm\nk , Wm\nu , Wm\nr and bm\nr are\nlearnable parameters.\nFor each node vi, we then perform self-attention\nover all the neighbor triples that it is involved, and\ncompute a new context representation with multiple\nattention heads:\ngl\ni = (\nM/hugeparallel\nm\nHeadm\ni )Wo\nHeadm\ni = softmax(Ql\ni(Kl)⊤\n√dk\n)Ul\nwhere gl\niis the aggregated representation computed\nover all neighbor triples of node vi with M atten-\ntion heads at l-th layer. gl\ni will be later used to\nlearn the updated representation of node vi. √dk\nis the scaling factor denoting the dimension size of\neach key vector. Wo is a learnable parameter.\nSyntax-guided Attention To automatically find\nthe indicative temporal cues for two event men-\ntions from their connection as well as surrounding\ncontexts, we design a new syntax-guided attention\nmechanism. For two event nodes vs and vt, we first\nextract the set of nodes from the dependency path\nbetween vs and vt (including vs and vt), which is\ndenoted as Θst. We then get all the triples from the\ndependency path between vs and vt as well as the\ntriples that any node from Θst is involved, which\nare denoted as Φst = ∪vi∈Θst {Nin\ni ∪Nout\ni }∪Pst.\nTo compute the syntax-guided attention over all the\ntriples from Φst, we apply three linear transforma-\ntions to get the query, key and value vectors where\nthe query vector is obtained from the representation\nof two event mentions, and key and value vectors\nare computed from the triples in Φst:\n˜Q\nl\nst = ˜W\nm\nq ·(hl−1\ns\n/hugeparallel\nhl−1\nt )x\n˜K\nl\nij = ˜W\nm\nk ˜R\nl−1\nij\n˜U\nl\nij = ˜W\nm\nu ˜R\nl−1\nij\n˜R\nl−1\nij = ˜W\nm\nr (hl−1\ni\n/hugeparallel\nrij\n/hugeparallel\nhl−1\nj ) + ˜br\nwhere m is the index of a particular head,\n˜Q\nl\nst, ˜K\nl\nij, ˜U\nl\nij denote the query, key and value vec-\ntors respectively. ˜R\nl−1\nij is the representation of a\ntriple (vi,rij,vj) ∈Φst. ˜W\nm\nq , ˜W\nm\nk , ˜W\nm\nv and\n˜W\nm\nr are learnable parameters.\nGiven the query vector, we then compute the at-\ntention distribution over all triples fromΦst and get\nan aggregated representation to denote the meaning-\nful temporal features captured from the connection\nbetween two event mentions and their surrounding\ncontexts.\n˜gl\nst = (\nM/hugeparallel\nm\n˜Head\nm\nst) · ˜Wp\n˜Head\nm\nst = softmax(\n˜Q\nl\nst( ˜K\nl\n)⊤\n√dk\n) ·˜U\nl\nwhere ˜gl\nst is the aggregated temporal related in-\nformation from all the triples in Φst based on the\nsyntax-guided attention at l-th layer. Wp is a learn-\nable parameter.\nNode Representation Fusion Each event node\nin graph Gwill receive two representations learned\nfrom the multi-head self-attention and syntax-\nguided attention, thus we further fuse the two rep-\nresentations for both the source node vs and the\ntarget node vt:\nˆh\nl\ns = ˜Wf(gl\ns\n/hugeparallel\n˜gl\nst) , ˆh\nl\nt = ˜Wf(˜gl\nst\n/hugeparallel\ngl\nt)\nwhere gl\ns and gl\nt denote the context representations\nlearned from the multi-head self-attention for vs\nand vt. ˜gl\nst denotes the representation learned from\nthe triples from Φst using syntax-guided attention.\nˆh\nl\ns and ˆh\nl\nt are the fused representations of vs and\nvt, respectively. ˜Wf is a learnable parameter.\nFor each non-event node vi, which only receives\na context representation gl\ni learned from the multi-\nhead self-attention, we apply a linear projection\nand get a new node representation:\nˆh\nl\ni = Wtgl\ni\nOur Syntax-guided Graph Transformer encoder\nis composed of a stack of multiple layers, while\neach layer consists of the two attention mechanisms\nand the fusion sub-layer. We use residual connec-\ntion followed by LayerNorm for each layer to get\nthe final representations of all the nodes:\nHl = LayerNorm( ˆH\nl\n+ Hl−1)\n382\n2.4 Temporal Relation Prediction\nTo predict the temporal relation between two event\nmentions es and et, we concatenate the final hidden\nstates of vs and vt obtained from the Syntax-guided\nGraph Transformer network, and apply a Feedfor-\nward Neural Network (FNN) to predict their rela-\ntionship\n˜yst = softmax(Wz(hL\ns\n/hugeparallel\nhL\nt ) + bt)\nwhere ˜ystdenotes the probabilities over all possible\ntemporal relations between event mentions es and\net.\nThe training objective is to minimize the follow-\ning cross-entropy loss function:\nLrel = −\n∑\nst∈∆\n∑\nx∈X\nβxyst,xlog(˜yst,x))\nwhere ∆ denotes the total set of event pairs for tem-\nporal relation prediction and X denotes the whole\nset of relation labels. yst,xis a binary indicator (0 or\n1) to show whether xis the same as the groundtruth\nlabel (yst,x = 1) or not ( yst,x = 0). We also as-\nsign a weight βx to each class to mitigate the label\nimbalance issue.\n3 Experiment\n3.1 Experimental Setup\nWe perform experiments on two public benchmark\ndatasets for temporal relation extraction: (1) TB-\nDENSE (Cassidy et al., 2014), which is a densely\nannotated dataset with 6 types of relations: Be-\nfore, After, Simultaneous, Includes, Is_included\nand Vague. (2) MATRES (Ning et al., 2018), which\nannotates verb event mentions along with 4 types\nof temporal relations: Before, After, Simultaneous\nand Vague. Additionally, we use POS tag infor-\nmation from MATRES provided by (Ning et al.,\n2019). For TB-D ENSE , we use spacy annotation\nfor predicting POS tag information which is based\non Universal POS tag set 4. For both benchmark\ndatasets, we use the same train/dev/test splits as pre-\nvious studies (Ning et al., 2019, 2017; Han et al.,\n2019a,b). Note that, for evaluation, similar as pre-\nvious work, we disregard the Vague relation from\nboth datasets (in the evaluation phase, we simply\nremove all ground truth Vague relation pairs). In\naddition, we will only consider event pairs from ad-\njacent sentences due to the fact that it will require\n4https://spacy.io/api/data-formats\nan exponential number of annotations if we also\nconsider event pairs from non-adjacent sentences,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this study.

We optimize\nthe parameters with grid search: training epoch 10,\nlearning rate ∈{3e-6,1e-5}, training batch size\n∈{16,32}, encoder layer size ∈{4,12}, number\nof heads ∈{1,8}. During training, we first opti-\nmize the event extraction module for 5 epochs to\nwarm up, and then jointly optimize both event ex-\ntraction and temporal relation extraction modules\nusing gold event pairs for another 5 epochs.\n3.2 Results\nWe evaluate SGT against two public benchmark\ndatasets under two settings: (1) joint event and tem-\nporal relation extraction (Table 3); (2) temporal\nrelation classification, where the gold event men-\ntions are known beforehand (Table 4). Note in the\n“joint” setting, we adopt the same strategy proposed\nin (Han et al., 2019b): we first train the event ex-\ntraction module, and then jointly optimize both\nevent extraction and temporal relation extraction\n5https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.\nhtml\n383\nDataset Model Pre-trained Model Event Detection Relation Extraction\nTB-D ENSE HNP19 (Han et al., 2019b) BERT Base 90.9 49.4\nOur Approach BERT Base 91.0 51.8\nMATRES\nCogCompTime2.0 (Ning et al., 2019) BERT Base 85.2 52.8\nHNP19 (Han et al., 2019b) BERT Base 87.8 59.6\nOur Approach BERT Base 90.5 62.3\nTable 3: Comparison of various approaches on joint event and relation extraction with F-score (%).

Overall, we observe that our ap-\nproach significantly outperforms baseline systems\nin both settings, with up to 7.9% absolute F-score\ngain on MATRES and 2.4% on TB-D ENSE .\nFrom Table 3, we see that our approach achieves\nbetter performance on event detection than base-\nline methods though they are based on the same\nBERT encoder. This is possibly because, during\njoint training, our approach leverages the depen-\ndency parsing trees, which improves the contextual\nrepresentations of the BERT encoder. In Table 4,\nunlike other models which are based on larger con-\ntextualized embeddings such as RoBERTa, our ap-\nproach with BERT base achieves comparable per-\nformance, and further surpasses the state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods using BERT-large embeddings,\nwhich demonstrate the effectiveness of our Syntax-\nguided Graph Transformer network.\nSome studies (Ning et al., 2019; Han et al.,\n2019b; Wang et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020) focus\non resolving the inconsistency in terms of the sym-\nmetry and transitivity of the temporal relations. For\nexample, if event A and event B are predicted as\nBefore, event B and event C are predicted asBefore,\nthen if event A and event C are predicted as Vague\nor After, it will be considered as inconsistent.

Consistency is defined as the percentage of\nthe original 100 examples for which the model’s pre-\ndictions of the perturbed examples are all correct in the\ncontrast set.\never, our approach shows consistent predictions\nwith few inconsistent cases when Simultaneous re-\nlation is involved. This analysis also demonstrates\nthat our approach can correctly capture the tempo-\nral cues between two event mentions.\nWe also examine the correctness and robustness\nof our approach on a contrast set ofMATRES (Gard-\nner et al., 2020), which is created with small man-\nual perturbation based on the original test set of\nMATRES in a meaningful way, such as rephrasing\nthe sentence or simply changing a word of the sen-\ntence to alter the relation type.

Table 5\nshows that our approach significantly outperforms\nthe baseline model on both the original test set and\nthe corresponding contrast set. The contrast consis-\ntency in Table 5 also indicates how well a model’s\ndecision boundary aligns with the actual decision\nboundary of the test instances, based on which we\ncan see that by explicitly capturing temporal cues,\nour approach is more accurate and robust than the\nbaseline method.\nAblation Study We further conduct ablation\nstudies to compare the performance of our ap-\nproach with two ablated versions of our method:\n(1) BERT with Graph Transformer (BERT-GT), for\nwhich we remove the syntaxic-guided attention and\nonly rely on the standard multi-head self-attention\nto obtain graph-based contextual representations\nof two event mentions and then predict their rela-\ntion; (2) BERT, where we further remove the Graph\nTransformer, and only use the pre-trained BERT\nlanguage model to encode the sentence and predict\nthe temporal relationship of two event mentions\nbased on their contextual representations.\nAblation F-score (%) Gain (%)\nBERT-SGT 79.3 0\nBERT-GT 77.5 -2.0\nBERT 75.5 -3.8\nTable 6: Ablation study on MATRES . We use BERT\nbase as the comparison basis.\nTable 6 also shows that by adding Graph Trans-\nformer, BERT-GT achieves 2.0% absolute F-score\nimprovement over the BERT baseline model,\ndemonstrating the benefit of dependency parsing\ntrees to temporal relation prediction. By further\nadding the new syntax-guided attention into Graph\nTransformer, the absolute improvement on F-score\n(1.8%) shows the effectiveness of our new Syntax-\nguided Graph Transformer and the importance of\ncapturing temporal cues from the connection of two\nevent mentions as well as their surround contexts.\nFigure 3 shows two examples as qualitative\nanalysis. In S1, BERT mistakenly predicts the\ntemporal relation as Before probably because it’s\nconfused by the context word Before. However, by\nincorporating the dependency graph, especially the\ntriples {worked, prep, Before}, { Before, pcomp,\nretiring} and the path between the two event men-\ntions, worked→prep→Before→pcomp→retiring,\nboth BERT-GT and our approach correctly\ndetermine the relation as After. In S2, both BERT\nand BERT-GT mistakenly predict the temporal\nrelation as Before as the context between the two\nevent mentions is very wide and complicated,\nand these two event mentions are not close\nwithin the dependency graph. However, by\nexplicitly considering and understanding the\nconnection between the two event mentions,\nsoughte1 →on→Marmara→was→part→Flotilla\n→soughte2 , our approach correctly predicts the\ntemporal relation between the two event mentions.\n3.3 SGT on Temporal Cues\nTo analyze the source of temporal cues for rela-\ntion prediction, we randomly sample 100 correct\nevent relation predictions given gold event men-\ntions from MATRES and select the triple that has\nthe highest temporal attention weight from the last\nlayer of the Syntax-guided Graph Transformer net-\nwork as a temporal cue candidate. We manually\nevaluate the validity of each temporal cue candi-\ndate, and further analyze if the cue is from the de-\npendency path between two event mentions, their\nsurrounding context, or both. Our analysis shows\nthat about 64% of the temporal cues are valid, 37%\nof them come from the dependency path, 17% are\nfrom local context, and the remaining 10% are\nfrom both. This verifies our initial observation\nthat most of the temporal cues are from the depen-\ndency path between two event mentions as well as\ntheir surrounding context. It also demonstrates the\n385\neffectiveness of our new syntax-guided attention\nmechanism.\n3.4 Impact of Wide Context\nWe further illustrate the impact of context width\nto both baseline model and our approach. For fair\ncomparison, we use three context width category,\n[context length <10, 10 <context length <20,\ncontext length > 20 ]. As we can see in Fig. 4,\nthe first category has 267 pairs, the second cate-\ngory has 343 pairs and the third category has 817\npairs. From our results, we observe that the BERT\nbaseline cannot predict the temporal relation of\ntwo event mentions with wide context but rather\nworking well when the event mentions are close\nto each other. Our model overall performs slightly\nworse in the second category but in general is very\ngood at predicting the temporal relationship for\nthe event mentions with short and context width.\nThis also proves the benefit of syntactic parsing\ntrees to the prediction of temporal relationship. For\nthe second category where the context length is\nwithin [10, 20], the performance of our approach\nslightly drops due to two reasons: (1) the training\nsamples within this range are not as sufficient as\nthe other two categories; (2) for most event pairs\nfrom this category, their dependency path is very\nlong and there is no explicit temporal indicative\nfeatures within their context or dependency path,\nmaking it more difficult for the model to predict\ntheir temporal relationship.\nFigure 4: Context width analysis on TB-D ENSE . The\nX axis shows the number of tokens between two events\nmentions. The left Y axis shows the data distribution\nof each width category indicating with blue bars. The\nright Y axis denotes the micro F-score for each width\ncategory.\n3.5 Remaining Errors\nWe randomly sample 100 classification errors from\nthe output of our approach and categorize them into\nfour categories. As Figure 5 shows, the first cate-\ngory is due to the complex or ambiguous context\n(54% of the total errors). The second category is\ndue to the complicated subordinate clause structure,\nespecially the clauses that are related to quote or\nreported speech, e.g., S2 in Figure 5. The third\nerror category is that our approach cannot correctly\ndifferentiate the actual events from the hypothetical\nand intentional events, while in most cases, the tem-\nporal relation among hypothetical and intentional\nevents is annotated as Vague. The last category is\ndue to the lack of sufficient annotation. We ob-\nserve that none of the Simultaneous relation can\nbe correctly predicted for MATRES dataset as the\npercentage of Simultaneous (3.7%) is much lower\nthan other relation types. In TB-D ENSE dataset,\nlabels are even more imbalanced as the percentage\nof Vague relation is over 50% while the percentage\nof Includes, Is_Included and Simultaneous are all\nless than 4%.\n4 Related Work\nEarly studies on temporal relation extraction\nmainly model it as a pairwise classification prob-\nlem (Mani et al., 2006; Verhagen et al., 2007; Verha-\ngen and Pustejovsky, 2008; Verhagen et al., 2010;\nBethard et al., 2016; MacAvaney et al., 2017) and\nrely on hand-crafted features and rules (Verhagen\nand Pustejovsky, 2008; Bethard et al., 2007) to ex-\ntract temporal event relations. Recently, deep neu-\nral networks (Dligach et al., 2017; Tourille et al.,\n2017) and large-scale pre-trained language mod-\nels (Han et al., 2019a, 2021; Wang et al., 2020a;\nZhou et al., 2020) are further employed and show\nstate-of-the-art performance.\nSimilar to our approach, several studies (Ling\nand Weld, 2010; Nikfarjam et al., 2013; Mirza\nand Tonelli, 2016; Meng et al., 2017; Cheng and\nMiyao, 2017; Huang et al., 2017) also explored\nsyntactic path between two events for temporal re-\nlation extraction. Different from previous work,\nour approach considers three important sources of\ntemporal cues: local context, denoting the neigh-\nbors of each event node within the dependency\ngraph; connection of two event mentions, which is\nbased on the dependency path between two event\nmentions; and rich semantics of concepts and de-\npendency relations, for example, the dependency\n386\nS2: \"We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we (e 1 : thought) that's where it would\nstop.\" He also (e 2 : talked) about his \" second job \" as the group's cameraman.

All these indica-\ntive features are automatically selected and aggre-\ngated with the multi-head self-attention and our\nnew syntax-guided attention mechanism.\nOur work is also related to the variants of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN) (Kipf and Welling, 2016;\nVeliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018), espe-\ncially Graph Transformer (Yun et al., 2019; Chen\net al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b).\nDifferent from previous GNNs which aim to cap-\nture the context from neighbors of each node within\nthe graph, in our task, we aim to select and capture\nthe most meaningful temporal cues for two event\nmentions from their connections within the graph\nas well as their surrounding contexts.\n5 Conclusion\nTemporal relationship between events is important\nfor understanding stories described in natural lan-\nguage text, and a main challenge is how to dis-\ncover and make use of the connection between\ntwo event mentions, especially when the event pair\nis far apart in text. This paper proposes a novel\nSyntax-guided Graph Transformer (SGT) that rep-\nresents the connection between an event pair via\nadditional attention heads over dependency parsing\ntrees. Experiments on benchmarking datasets, MA-\nTRES , TB-D ENSE , and a contrast set of MATRES ,\nshow that our approach significantly outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods in a variety of set-\ntings, including event detection, temporal relation\nclassification (where events are given), and tempo-\nral relation extraction (where events are predicted).\nIn the future, we will investigate the potential of\nthis approach to other relation extraction tasks.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers and area chair\nfor their valuable time and constructive comments.\nWe also thank the support from the Amazon Re-\nsearch Awards.\nReferences\nS.
