    "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> This paper addresses the challenges and solutions related to identifying false positive (FP) alerts in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, which often overwhelm security operators. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach that employs a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically Llama, as an AI agent through a contextual-based approach to identify FPs in security alerts generated by multiple network sensors and collected in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Our method follows three key steps: data extraction, enrichment, and playbook execution. First, Llama normalizes security alerts using a common schema, extracting key contextual elements such as IP addresses, host names, filenames, services, and vulnerabilities. Second, these extracted elements are enriched by integrating external resources such as threat intelligence databases and Configuration Management Databases (CMDB) to generate dynamic metadata. Finally, this enriched data is analyzed through predefined false positive investigation playbooks, designed by security professionals, to systematically evaluate and identify FPs.By automating the false positive identification process, this approach reduces the operational burden on human security operators, enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of SOCs, and improving the organization's security posture.",
