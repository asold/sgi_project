  "abstract": "In this paper, a brief introduction to Machine Learning and its Tools are studied.In the recent developments, most of the Machine learning tools are more advanced and efficient.The various tools learn the machine by using a training set, which predicts the output correctly and efficiently.Machine Learning is applied in different applications such as Agriculture, Data Quality, Information Retrieval, Financial Market Analysis etc.., In this paper, we have discussed few tools like Scikit learn, Pytorch, Tensor flow, Amazon Machine Learning, KNIME, Rapid Miner, Keras, and Shogun with its features and its advantages.",
