INTRODUCTION\nA\nBNORMAL energy dissipation inside a power trans-\nformer results in partial destruction of liquid and solid\ninsulating materials, generating trace amounts of gaseous\nbyproducts dissolved in the oil. The most common transformer\ninsulation liquid is a reﬁned mineral oil. Most commonly used\nfor solid insulation are kraft paper and pressboard made of\nhighly processed cellulose material.\nTransformer dissolved gas analysis (DGA) consists of col-\nlecting oil samples from transformers, measuring the concen-\ntrations of dissolved gases in the oil samples, and interpreting\nthoseconcentrations(andanychangessinceprevioussamples).\nThe main interpretive results are as follows:\n• adeterminationwhetherthereisanysignofafault,thatis,\nan abnormality that may be a precursor to failure;\n• ifthereisevidenceofafault ,identiﬁcationoftheapparent\nfault type;\n• ranking the transformer's condition based on the absence\nof a fault or the apparent fault severity.\nItisthethirdaspectofDGA—fa ultseverityassessment—that\nis the subjectofthis paper.

Dissolved\noxygen and nitrogen are also measured and inter-\npreted, but they are not byproducts of insulation deterioration.\nCurrent methods of transformer DGA fault severity classiﬁ-\ncation employ statistically or empirically derived gas concen-\ntration threshold levels, usually referred to as limits, based on\nthese principles:\n1) Hydrocarbongasproducedinatransformeristheresultof\nabnormal stress or an internal defect (fault).\n2) The amount of each hydrocarbon gas produced since the\ntransformer was known to be in good condition is roughly\nproportional to the intensity and duration of the abnormal\ncondition that produced it.\nHydrogen and carbon monoxideare very useful for fault de-\ntection and diagnosis and should not be ignored for those pur-\nposes. As we discuss in Section II-A, however, hydrogen and\ncarbonmonoxidecanbeproduced,sometimesinlargeamounts,\nby processesthatarenotfaultrelated.Thefactthattheyarenot\nexclusively fault related complicates their usefulness for fault\nseverity assessment.\nA. IEC and IEEE Multigas DGA Severity Classiﬁcation\nThe IEC 60599 transformer DGA guide [1] employs two\nlimits for each combustible gas. The lower limit, called a\n“typicalconcentrationvalue,” isathresholdabovewhichcloser\nattentionandinvestigationmay beneededifgasconcentrations\nare rising. The “typical value” is often chosen as the 90th\npercentile value of a gas concentration in a large database.\nThe higher IEC limit for each gas, the “alarm concentration\nvalue,” is set to a level where an urgent response is likely to\nbe needed. Although the IEC guide does not prescribe numeric\nseverity levels, for discussion purposes, the IEC scheme can\nbe regarded as classifying DGA results into three levels, where\nlevel 1 (below the “typical value”) is the normal condition;\nlevel2istheintermediatelevel,wheretheremayormaynotbe\nevidence of an active fault; and level 3 (at or above the “alarm\nvalue”) signiﬁes increased risk of failure.\nThe IEEE C57.104 DGA guide for oil-ﬁlled transformers [2,\nSec. 6.5] classiﬁes gas concentrations into condition levels 1\nthrough4basedonthreelimitsforeachcombustiblegasandfor\ntotaldissolvedcombustiblegas(TDCG).IEEEconditionlevels\n1and2correspondtotheirIECcounterparts,whilelevels3and\n4c o r r e s p o n dt oI E Cl e v e l3 .\n0885-8977 © 2015 IEEE.

Total Dissolved Combustible Gas (TDCG)\nWhile it is conventional and practical to base DGA fault\nseverity assessment on multiple gas concentrations, especially\non the four light hydrocarbon gases, it seems highly desirable\nt os i m p l i f yt h a tt a s kb yﬁ n d i n gas i n g l eq u a n t i t yu p o nw h i c h\nfault severity assessment can be based.\nTable III of the IEEE guide [2] for DGA in oil-ﬁlled trans-\nformers advocates the use of total dissolved combustible gas\n(TDCG) for severity assessment, presumably on the principle\nthat every transformer fault produces a combination of com-\nbustible gases. Unfortunately, TDCG's reliability as a fault\nseverity indicator isquestionablebecausehydrogen and carbon\nmonoxide make up most of it, and production of those gases in\na transformer is not exclusively fault related.\nThedegreetowhichtheinclusionof\nandCOtendstocor-\nrupt the apparent fault severity based on TDCG is difﬁcult to\nquantify, but Table I, derived from the large database of elec-\ntric utility DGA data discussed in Section III, shows that those\ng a s e st e ndt obedo mi n a nti nT DC Gi na l lb utt h emo s te xt r e me\ncases.ThemedianproportionofCOinTDCGis57%,whilethe\nmedian proportion of\nin TDCG is 72%. Only in the\n2% of samples with the very highest TDCG concentrations are\nthe exclusively fault-related gases predominant over hydrogen\nand CO.\nAnother problem with TDCG as a fault severity indicator,\ndiscussed in [3], is that it gives methane and ethane (associ-\nated with low and medium-rangethermal faults) equal weight\nwith acetylene and ethylene (associated with arcing and high-\nrange thermal faults). As is demonstrated in [3], that tends to\nmake TDCG relatively less responsive to the most energetic\nfault types.\nC. Energy Weighting and NEI\nIn [3], we show that the sensitivity of a gas sum such as total\ndissolved hydrocarbon gas (TDHG) to arcing and high-range\nthermal faults is improved by weighting the gas concentrations\nin proportion to their respective enthalpies of formation from\nn-octane.\nThe enthalpy of formationof substance B from substance A\nistheamountofenergyrequiredtoproduceonemoleofBfrom\nA, or\ngrams of B, where is the molecular mass of B\nexpressed in grams per mole. For example, the molecular mass\nof methane is 16.043 g/mol. A mole of a gas (such as methane)\nhas a volume of 22.4 L at standard temperature and pressure\n(273 K and 101.325 kPa). As shown in Table II, the enthalpy\nof formation of methane gas from n-octane is 77.7 kJ/mol. For\ndetails on how the enthalpies in the table were calculated, see\n[3].\nTABLE II\nENTHALPIES OFFORMATION OFFAULT GASES FROM N-OCTANE\nTABLE III\nCOMPOSITION OF THEDGA DATABASE\nTABLE IV\nESTIMATED RELATIVE UNCERTAINTIES BASED ON\nMODERATE-RANGE DATA\nTABLE V\nEMPIRICAL LIMITS FORCLASSIFYING TRANSFORMERS AS\nHIGH- OR LOW-\nIt seems reasonable to suspect that instead of gas concentra-\ntions,thetotalfaultenergycoul dbeasuitablebasisforseverity\nassessment. The respective concentrations and enthalapies of\nformation of the hydrocarbon gases can be used to calculate a\nquantity directly related to fault energy dissipated within the\ntransformer, which we call thenormalized energy intensity\n(NEI). As is shown below, NEI-based fault severity assessment\nis sensitive to all IEC fault types and has superior responsive-\nness to changes in the composition of the fault gas mixture.\nII. N\nORMALIZED ENERGY INTENSITY\nLapworth published a DGA interpretive method [4] em-\nploying empirically weighted gas concentrations for fault-type\nidentiﬁcation and severity scoring. Our 2012 paper [3] showed\nthat natural weights—based on the energy required to produce\nfaultgasesfrommineraloil—canbeusedforenergy-weighting\nof sums of fault gas concentrations, improving sensitivity to\nhigh-energy fault types T3 and D2.\nIn fact, the enthalpies of formation shown in Table II can be\nused to calculate a “normalized energy intensity” NEI (kJ/kL)\nfor fault gas concentrations found in a transformer oil sample.\nJAKOB AND DUKARM: THERMODYNAMIC ESTIMATION OF TRANSFORMER FAULT SEVERITY 1943\nTheNEIbasedonconcentrations ofthefourhydrocarbongases:\nmethane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene is shown below to be\na suitable quantity for DGA fault severity classiﬁcation.\nA. Rationale\nWhy should NEI not include carbon monoxide or dioxide?\nCellulose is a labile materialthat decomposes spontaneously\neven at ambient temperatures. The rate of cellulose decom-\nposition is directly related to temperature and other variables,\nsuch as moisture, acidity, and oxygen dissolved in the oil. In-\ntermediate decomposition products are formed when cellulose\ndecomposes, but the ﬁnal decomposition products are carbon\nmonoxide,carbondioxide,andwater.Productionofthosethree\ncompoundscontinuesthroughoutthelifeofthecellulose-based\ninsulation. Carbon oxides can also be generated from the oil\nat high temperatures if sufﬁcient oxygen is present. For these\nreasons, we have not includedcarbon dioxide and carbon\nmonoxide in the NEI calculations.\nIn contrast to cellulose, the many organic molecules found\nin mineral oil transformer ﬂuidsare thermodynamically stable.\nSincethespontaneousdecompositionofthosemoleculesattem-\nperatures normally found in transformers is minimal, the low\nmolecular weight hydrocarbon gases: methane, ethane, ethy-\nlene, and acetylene are almost exclusively formed by abnormal\nenergy dissipation in the oil.\nHydrogenisalsoproducedwhen oilmoleculesaredestroyed.\nItisdeﬁnitelyafaultgas,andweconsideredusingitinthecalcu-\nlationofNEI.Thereare,however,twoproblemswithhydrogen\nas a fault severity indicator. First, hydrogen can be produced\nfrom nonfault processes, suchas electrolysis of water and re-\naction of acidic material with galvanized metal. Hydrogen has\nalso been observed as a source of stray gassing in hydro-re-\nﬁned transformer oils. The second problem is that hydrogen is\na very small diatomic molecule and has a high escape velocity\nfrom mineral oil. Thus, the hydrogen concentration measured\nfor DGA has poor reproducibility due to a loss of gas from the\ntransformerandfromﬁttingsandsyringesduringoilsamplecol-\nlection and processing. This variability in hydrogen concentra-\ntion measurements is a major source of “noise” observed with\nDGA data.\nTo summarize, we recommend inclusion of only the hydro-\ncarbon gases methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene for the\ncalculation of NEI to represent fault energy dissipated in the\ntransformer oil.\nB. Calculation\nTocalculateNEI,theconcentration(\nL/L—ppmbyvolume)\nof each hydrocarbon gas is multiplied by (1 L)/(L) and\nthen by (1 mol)/(22.4 L) to convert the numerator to moles,\nthen multiplying by (\nL/kL) converts the denominator from\nL to kL. The resulting quantity (mol/kL) is multiplied by the\nenthalpyofformation(kJ/mol)t oobtainkJ/kLforthatgas.The\nsumofthekJ/kLquantitiesforthefourhydrocarbongasesisthe\nNEI. With some algebraic simpliﬁcation, the calculation is\n(1)\nwhere, in accordance with ordinary usage,\ndenote the respective gas concentrations inL/L.\nIf the gas concentrations are reported at a temperature other\nthan 273 K (0C), it is necessary to multiply NEI as calcu-\nlated before by the temperature correction factor\n,w h e r eis the Celsius reporting temperature for the gas\nconcentrations.\nASTM D3612 [5] speciﬁes a reporting temperature of\n0 C, while IEC 60567 [6] speciﬁes 20C. As indicated in [7]\n(Table X), various reporting temperatures are used for online\nDGA monitors.\nIII. P\nRELIMINARY STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nDGA databases were contributed by two large U.S. electric\nutilities, identiﬁed here as Source A and Source B. Incom-\nplete samples (with missing gasdata) and known after-failure\nsamples were removed. One sample per year (the latest) was\nretainedforeachtransformer, toavoidbiasfromcloselyspaced\ninvestigative sampling. NEI was inserted into each sample\nrecord. The composition of the combined database is indicated\nby Table III.\nA. Relative Uncertainty of NEI\nAverage relative uncertainty of NEI and TDCG was esti-\nmated directlyandindirectly(by calculationfromuncertainties\nof the relevant gas concentration measurements) from a subset\nof the combined database where all variables were limited to\na moderate range. The lower limit of the moderate range was\n1\nL/L for acetylene, 10L/L for other gases and TDCG, and\n0.1 kJ/kLfor NEI. The upper limit of the moderate range for\nacetylenewas10\nL/L,andforallothergasconcentrationsand\nNEI, it was the respective 90th percentile. All of those upper\nlimits (except for acetylene's) are the respective\nlimits from\nTables VI and VII.\nThe restriction to moderate ranges was motivated by two\nconsiderations.First,theuncertaintiesofthegasconcentrations\nand NEI are of practical importance mainly in those ranges,\ncharacteristicofno-faultandincipient-faultconditions.Second,\nthe range restriction eliminates most large gas increments\nthat would interfere with the estimation of nonfault-related\nvariation.\nAllofthedirectstatisticalestim atesofrelativeuncertaintyare\nshowninTableIV.Thehighestimateduncertaintyforacetylene\nispresumablyduetotherestrictiontolowconcentrations(1–10\nL/L) where, as noted in [8], the relative uncertainty is gen-\nerally high. For acetylene, concentrations above the low range\nare almost all fault related and,therefore, unsuitable for the de-\ntermination of normal measurement uncertainty. The high esti-\nmated relative uncertainties of hydrogen and carbon monoxide\nareconsistentwithpoorreproducibilityduetoleakage,asnoted\nin Subsection II-A.\nIndirect relative uncertainty estimates for NEI and TDCG\nwere calculated for each samplerecord using the combustible\ngas uncertainties of Table IV and a formula for combined stan-\ndard uncertainty when all measurement variables have corre-\nlation\n(see [9, 5.2 Note 1]), since all gases tend to increase\nsimultaneously.Themeanrelati veuncertaintycalculatedinthis\nway was 0.18 for NEI and 0.24 for TDCG.\n1944 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 30, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015\nThese results indicate that therelative uncertainties of NEI\nand TDCG are, on average, not worse than those of the gas\nconcentration measurements upon which they depend.\nB. Stratiﬁcation by\nAn exploratory analysis [10] of a large transformer DGA\ndatabase was conducted for IEEE/PES Transformers Com-\nmittee Working Group C57.104 to investigate the effects of\ntransformer age, megavolt-ampere rating, kilovolt rating, and\noxygen/airratioondistributionsofkeygasconcentrations.The\nlargest effect was associated with the proportion of dissolved\noxygen versus nitrogen. Transformers with more oxygen in the\noil tend to have lower concentrations of dissolved combustible\ngases.\nThebalancebetweenoxygenand n i tr ogenint het r ansf ormer\noil depends on the oil preservation system of the transformer.\nSome preservation systems—and transformers with leaky con-\nservatordiaphragmsandgaske ts—allowatmosphericoxygento\ndiffuse into the transformer, while sealed or nitrogen-regulated\nsystems generally havevery low oxygen content in theoil rela-\ntive to nitrogen.\nUnfortunately, the databases used for statistical derivation of\ngas concentration limits for DGA sometimes have incomplete,\nunreliable, or entirely missing information about the oil preser-\nvation types of the transformers. In such cases, it is useful to\nclassify transformers as low oxygen or high oxygen, based on\nthe available DGA data.\nThemedian\nratiovaluewascalculatedforeachtrans-\nformer,basedonallofitsDGAsamples,andforeachsourceand\nforthecombineddatabase,thedistributionofthosetransformer\nmedian values was plotted. With a logarithmic horizontal axis,\nthesedistributionswere allseentohavea localminimum prob-\nability density between\n(oil saturated with air) and\n(very low oxygen in oil). (See Fig. 1.) The loca-\ntion of that local minimum along the horizontal axis was used\nto deﬁne a limit for each source for classifying transformers as\nlowoxygenorhighoxygen.Atransformerisinthehigh-oxygen\nclass if its median\nis less than the limit; otherwise, it is\ninthelow-oxygenclass.The limitsforeachdatasource\nand for the combined database are shown in Table V.\nTheempirical limitof5.94forthecombineddatabase\ncorrespondsto 0.14,closeto 0.15,oneofthe\nad-hoc threshold values for used in [10].\nC.

For the low-oxygen\ntransformersinthecombineddatabase,the90th,95th,and98th\npercentileacetyleneconcen trationsare0,1,and6\nL/L,respec-\ntively. For the purposes of this study, the acetylene limits in\nJAKOB AND DUKARM: THERMODYNAMIC ESTIMATION OF TRANSFORMER FAULT SEVERITY 1945\n[2, Table 1] are used instead of percentile-based limits for both\nlow-oxygenandhigh-oxygentrans formers.Thoselimits,inour\nnotation, are 2, 10, and 36 in units ofL/L.\nThe NEI limits in Tables VII and VIII are based on different\nsets of percentiles, as the tablecaptions indicate. The motiva-\ntion for an alternative set of NEI limits is explained in Subsec-\ntion V-A.\nIV. DGA S\nCORING\nThe gas concentration limits are used for assigning a score,\nor numeric condition code, to a transformer DGA sample as a\nroughindicatoroffaultseverity.A sdescribedin[1]and[2],the\ninterpretationandrankingofDGAresultsforactualtransformer\ncondition assessment involvesnuances that are not essential to\nour purpose here, which is to compare DGA scoring based on\ngas concentration limits versus scoring based on NEI limits, to\nshow that NEI-based scoring is at least as sufﬁcient for DGA\nfault severity assessment as gas concentration scoring.\nIEEE-typenumericDGAscoresarecustomarilywholenum-\nbers, but for better comparison of scoring methods we include\na fractional part in the score by interpolation. According to\ncommon usage, a score below 2 is considered acceptable for\nnormal operation (although, in practice, the score is not all that\nis taken into consideration); a score of 2 or higher motivates\ninvestigation, possible supplementary testing, and possible\nconsideration of mitigative or corrective action. A score of at\nleast 2 but less than 3 would usually be considered cautionary,\natleast3butlessthan4would be reactedto moreurgently,and\na score of 4 or more would usually be treated as an emergency\nor at least as a sign of advanced deterioration.\nTo support these interpretations and their economic conse-\nquences, the DGA limits can be and often are adjusted for site-\nspeciﬁcconditions,requirements, andbudgetaryconstraints.As\n[1]indicates,thechoiceofpercen tilesorothercriteriaforinitial\nderivation of DGA limits is a matter of engineering judgment,\nnot a normative requirement.\nFor comparison of severity scoring based on gas concentra-\ntions versus NEI, the combined database was augmented by\nclassifyingeachtransformeracco rdingtoitsoxyg encontent,se-\nlecting the appropriate set of DGA limits for each transformer,\naddinganHCgasscoreandanNEIscoretoeachsamplerecord\nbased onthoselimits,and addinganapparentfaulttypetoeach\nsamplerecordhavinghydrocarbo ngasconcentrationsthatwere\nn o te x t r e m e l yl o w .D e t a i l so ft h a tp r o c e s sw e r ea sf o l l o w s .\nA. Choose DGA Limits for Each Transformer\nEach transformer was classiﬁed as low oxygen or high\noxygen by comparing its median\nwith the\nlimit for its respective data source. A set of hydrocarbon gas\nand NEI limits was chosen based on the data source and the\ntransformer's high/low-oxygen classiﬁcation.\nB .

Assign the NEI Score to Each Sample\nFor each oil sample, the NEI was calculated from the hydro-\ncarbon gas concentrations. Then an NEI score for the sample\nwas obtained by comparing the NEI value\nwith the trans-\nformer'sNEIlimits accordingtothesamefourrules\nas given before. For NEI, there is only one score, so it is not\nnecessary to take a maximum.\nD. Assign Apparent Fault Type to Samples\nForsampleswhereatleastoneof methane,ethylene,oracety-\nlene had a concentration of at least 10\nL/L, an apparent fault\ntype was assigned, based on the Duval Triangle [11]. The as-\nsignmentofanapparentfaulttypewasdoneforpurposesofsta-\ntistical comparison, not as a judgment that any particular sam-\nples did or did not indicate a transformer fault.\nFault gases are often present in moderate amounts in\ntrouble-free transformers due to the cumulative result of op-\nerational stress and incidents,such as temporary overloading,\nhot weather, and through faults. In those cases, the apparent\nfault type indicates the generalnature of the dominant process\nresponsible for generating the residual gases found in the\ntransformer. See Table IX for the distributions of the apparent\nfault types for the combined database.\nV. C\nOMPARISON OF THESCORING METHODS\nFor a comparison of NEI scoring with HC gas scoring, our\nemphasis is on the similarities and differences of how the\ntwo methods rate the severity of generic fault types, given\nsome reasonable set of DGA limits to work from. We do not\nassert that the limits used here are generically useful or that\nthe DGA scores alone are sufﬁcient for DGA interpretation in\na production setting. The following discussion is intended to\nshow that NEI scoring, with an appropriate choice of limits,\nis an adequate and effective alternative to HC gas scoring or\nany similar method of fault severity assessment based on gas\nconcentrations.\n1946 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 30, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015\nTABLE X\nSCORING METHOD SENSITIVITIES BYFAULT TYPE\nA. Sensitivity\nTable X shows how each scoring method, with the DGA\nlimits from Tables VI, VII, and VIII, rates apparent fault\nseverity. Each fault type is examined individually to see\nwhether there are fault-type-speciﬁc differences in sensitivity,\nand,ifso,whethertheymightaffecttheusefulnessofaseverity\nscoring method.\nEach row of the table shows the sensitivity of a scoring\nmethod to a fault type at three severity levels. Here, ALL des-\nignates all of the sample records, regardless of fault type. For\nthe three levels\n2.0, 3.0, 3.95, a proportionis given,\nwhich is the proportion of all sample records with that fault\ntypethathaveascoregreaterthan\naccordingtothedesignated\nscoring method. The top level considered is 3.95 instead of\n4.0 because, according to the scoring rules (Subsection IV-B),\nthere cannot be any samples with a score greater than 4.0.\n1) HC Gas Method Sensitivity:For the HC gas method and\nfault type ALL, meaning all 77456 of the sample records ac-\ncording to Table IX, p(2.0) is 0.20. That means that 20% of all\nsample records have an HC gas score greater than 2.0. For the\n15144-record subset with an apparent fault type of T3, 0.41 or\n41%ofthosesampleshaveanHCgasscoregreaterthan2.0.For\nthe 609-record subset with an apparent fault type of D2, practi-\ncally 100% of those records have an HC gas score higher than\n2.0.\nFor all of the fault types (DT, D1, D2) that necessarily in-\nvolve a nonzero acetylene concentration, the HC gas sensitivi-\nties—particularlyatthe\n2.0level—areextremelyhigh.That\nisbecausetheIEEElimitsforacetylenearesetverylow,sothat\nalmost every sample matching a DT, D1, or D2 fault type has\nan acetylene concentration exceeding the acetylene\nlimit.\n2) Initial Comparison of HC Gas and NEI Sensitivities:The\nNEI rows in Table X are for NEI scoring based on the limits\ndeﬁned by the 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles of NEI. Those\nlimits for the combined database are shown in Table VII. With\nthose limits, NEI scoring is much less sensitive than the HC\ngas method at all three levels (2.0, 3.0, 3.5) to all fault types.\nFor example, NEI,with those limits, scores 16% of T3samples\nhigher than 2.0, while HC gas scores 41% of them higher than\n2.0. To adjust the NEI sensitivity, different limits are needed.\n3) Increasing NEI Sensitivity—New Limits: Note that the\nALL row for the NEI method contains proportions that are\nclosely related to the percentiles used for deﬁning the limit\ncorresponding to each level. For example\nThis is to be expected—if the 90th percentile of NEI deﬁnes\nthe limit, then approximately 90% of all samples must have\na score that is less than or equal to 2.0, and approximately 10%\nofallsamplesmusthaveascoreabove2.0.Thesplitisnotexact\nbecauseoftheeffectofnumeroussamplessharingthesameNEI\nvalue at low levels. In order to achieve NEI sensitivity similar\nto that of the HC gas method, then, it should sufﬁce to deﬁne\nnew NEIlimitswithpercentilescorrespondinginthesameway\nto the values (0.20, 0.10, 0.04) in the ALL row of the HC gas\nmethod,thatis,the80th,90th,and95thpercentilesofNEI.The\nNEI limits deﬁned in that way are shown in Table VIII, and the\ncorrespondingsensitivityresultsareshownintheNEI*rowsof\nTable X.\nWith the alternative NEI limits, the sensitivity of the NEI\nmethod is similar to that of the HC gas method for all fault\ntypesnotinvolvingacetylene. ScanningdowntheNEI*rowsof\nTable X visually, it is evident that the NEI sensitivity is higher\nfor the more energetic thermal fault type T3(veryhot thermal),\nand still higher for D1 (low-energy sparking) and D2 (high-en-\nergyarcing).Thatisadirectcons equenceofthehighenthalpies\nof the primary indicator gases for those fault types—ethylene\nand acetylene (see Table II). The lower sensitivity to the less\ndangerous fault types—PD, T1, and T2—reﬂects the lower en-\nthalpiesofmethaneandethane—higherconcentrationsofthose\ngases are required to raise NEI to exceed an NEI limit.\nBecause of the high enthalpy of acetylene, the NEI scoring\nforarcingfaultsD1andD2isveryconservative,giving,forex-\nample, 65% of all D2 samples a score higher than 2.0. In cases\nwhere a proactive response totrace amounts of acetylene is\nmandated, the equipment operator is free to apply special mea-\nsures based on the appearance of small amounts of acetylene,\nregardlessoftheNEIscore.Thatscore,however,providesadi-\nrect indication of the level of energy dissipated so far by the\nfault.\nB. Rigidity\nAmong samples with any particular HC gas score, many of\nthe NEI scores will be higher and many lower (assuming that\nthe alternative NEI limits are used). That is because in almost\nall cases, the HC gas score is determined by the concentration\nJAKOB AND DUKARM: THERMODYNAMIC ESTIMATION OF TRANSFORMER FAULT SEVERITY 1947\nTABLE XI\nEXAMPLE—TWO SAMPLES WITH THESAME HC\nGAS SCORE BUT DIFFERENT NEI SCORES\nTABLE XII\nDOMINANT GASES FORHC GAS SCORING OFEACH FAULT TYPE\nof a single “key” gas, while the NEI score is based on the con-\ncentrationsof all hydrocarbon gasesin each case.For example,\nconsiderthetwohypotheticalsamplesfromalow-oxygentrans-\nf o r m e rs h o w ni nT a b l eX I .T h eN E Is c o r e sa r eb a s e do nt h ea l -\nternative limits in Table VIII. Based on 100 ppm of ethylene,\nboth samples receive an HC gas score of 3.04. But Sample A,\nwith very low levels of hydrocarbon gases other than ethylene,\nhas an NEI score of 2.06, while Sample B, with much higher\nlevels of nonethylene hydrocarbon gases, has an NEI score of\n3.78.TheNEIscoringmethodisabletodistinguishbetweentwo\nsamples that clearly represent different levels of fault activity,\nwhiletheHCgasscore,representingonlythemaximumoffour\nindividual gas concentration scores, makes no distinction.\nTable XII identiﬁes the predominant or “key” hydrocarbon\ngas or gases, according to the HC gas scoring method, for each\nfault type. The calculations for that table were based on all\nsample records from the combined database where the HC gas\nscore is at least 2.0 and where a fault type is given. For brevity,\nletthosebecalled“faultsamples.”Thetableshowsthenumber\n(“Samples”) and percentage (“%Samples”) of fault samples of\nthe indicated fault type where the score of the indicated gas is\nequaltotheHCgasscoreofthesample.Foreachfaulttype,the\ngases that are not listed are dominant in only a small minority\nof cases.\nThus,forexample,forfaulttypeT3,thereare5695faultsam-\nples where the ethylene score is equal to the sample's HC gas\nscore. Those 5695 records represent 89.7% of all fault samples\nhaving a fault type of T3.\nIn summary, for the HC gas method, almost all of the PD\nscores are determined by methane; for T1, almost all scores are\ndetermined by methane or ethane; for T2, ethane determines\nmost of the scores; for T3, ethylene almost always determines\nthe score; and for DT and the arcing faults, acetylene almost\nalways determines the score.\nTABLE XIII\nEXAMPLE—DGA HISTORY OF AFAILED TRANSFORMER\nVI. DGA CASE HISTORY EXAMPLE\nA case history of a 90-MVA nitrogen-blanketed 138/69 kV\ntransformer illustrates the application of NEI scoring. Data for\nthis example are shown in Table XIII. The low-oxygen alterna-\ntive NEI limits in Table VIII are used. HC gas scores, based on\nthe low-oxygen gas concentration limits in Table VI, are pro-\nvided for comparison.\nOilsample1containednodetect ableamountsofcombustible\ngas.Aboutﬁveyears(1748days)la ter,themethane,ethane,and\nethylene levels, consistent with a T3 (high-range thermal) fault\ntype, raised the NEI to 0.577 with a score of 2.12.

C\nONCLUSION\nFortransformerDGA,theassessmentofrelativeriskorfault\nseverity is conventionally based on the consideration of a com-\n1948 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 30, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015\nbinationofcombustiblegasconcentrations.Amodelofthatap-\nproach, based on concentrationsof transformer oil of light hy-\ndrocarbongases(theHCgasmethod),wascomparedwithapro-\nposed new approach, based on the fault energy required to pro-\nduce the observed hydrocarbon gas concentrations (NEI).\nThe HC gas scoring method, and similar schemes based on\ndifferent assortmentsof gases,require two or three gas concen-\ntrationlimitspergas.Thescore s,basedongasconcentrationsas\nproxiesforfaultseverity,arenot straightforwardlyinterpretable\nin terms of fault energy and do not discriminate between dif-\nferent mixtures of gas produced by more or less severe or pro-\nlonged faults. Since percentile-based gas concentration limits\nare usually unsuitable for acetylene, gas concentration scoring\nmethodsareforcedtouseprecauti onaryacetylenelimits,based\non engineering judgment, which tend to rate arcing-type faults\nvery differently than others.\nThe NEI DGA scoring method, based on hydrocarbon fault\ngas concentrations and enthalpies of formation, provides a nu-\nmeric fault severity score that is directly related to the amount\nof fault energy expended in the oil, even for arcing-type faults.\nSince NEI is based on all hydrocarbon gas concentrations, not\njust on one at a time, it responds better to gradual increases\nin fault severity. It is sensitive to each of the IEC transformer\nfaulttypes,anditsoverallsensitivitycanbeadjustedwithapre-\ndictableeffectby modifying thelimits.For an IEEE-style scale\nof DGA scores from 1 to 4, only three NEI limits are needed.\nThe NEI is easily calculated and, with only two or three limits\nto consider, the scoring logic is very simple.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] Mineral Oil Impregnated Electrical Equipment in Service—Guide to\nthe Interpretation of Dissolved and Free Gases Analysis, IEC 60599,\n2007.\n[2] IEEE Guide for the Interpretation of Gases Generated in Oil-Immersed\nTransformers, IEEE C57.104-2008, Feb. 2009.\n[3] F.
