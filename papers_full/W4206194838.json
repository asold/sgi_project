    "abstract": "The number of trees and their spatial distribution are key information for forest management. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have been proposed and shown promising results in lowering the expensive labor cost of a forest inventory. In this paper, we propose a new efficient deep learning model called density transformer or DENT for automatic tree counting from aerial images. The architecture of DENT contains a multi-receptive field convolutional neural network to extract visual feature representation from local patches and their wide context, a transformer encoder to transfer contextual information across correlated positions, a density map generator to generate spatial distribution map of trees, and a fast tree counter to estimate the number of trees in each input image. We compare DENT with a variety of state-of-art methods, including one-stage and two-stage, anchor-based and anchor-free deep neural detectors, and different types of fully convolutional regressors for density estimation. The methods are evaluated on a new large dataset we built and an existing cross-site dataset. DENT achieves top accuracy on both datasets, significantly outperforming most of the other methods. We have released our new dataset, called Yosemite Tree Dataset, containing a 10 km2 rectangular study area with around 100k trees annotated, as a benchmark for public access.",
