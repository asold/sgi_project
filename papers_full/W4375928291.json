INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers are important components in electric\npower systems [1], [2], [3]. The main protection of power\ntransformers is the differential protection which is based\non Kirchhoff’s current law. However, the transformer dif-\nferential protection may be incorrectly tripped by magnetiz-\ning inrush condition which belongs to a kind of non-fault\ncondition. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly distinguish\nthe magnetizing inrush current and the fault current, before\nthe transformer differential protection is about to act. Once\na magnetizing inrush current is recognized, the differential\nprotection will be blocked.\nConventionally, the second harmonic principle and\ndead-angle principle are utilized to cope with this issue. How-\never they have been proved to be not always effective [4], [5].\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Gerard-Andre Capolino.\nHence, various new methods are presented in the literature.\nThey can be grouped into six categories:\nCategory 1: Methods based on statistical parameters. These\nmethods construct protection criteria according to statistical\nnumerical distribution of sampled signals [4], [5].\nCategory 2: Waveform similarity methods. Unlike the\nfault current, the magnetizing inrush waveform does not\ntake a sinusoidal form. Based on the waveform similar-\nity, several methods such as probabilistic distance mea-\nsures [6], Kullback-Leibler divergence [7], discrete Fréchet\ndistance [8] and Hausdorff distance [9], [10] have been\ninvestigated.\nCategory 3: Electrical parameter-based methods. They\nincludes the current change ratio (CCR) and the percentage\narea difference (PAD) [11], the rate of phase angle [12],\npositive and negative sequence components [13], and the\nSub-Cycle phase angle distance [14].\nCategory 4: Methods based on signal transform.

Current signal waveform of power transformers.\n(a) magnetizing inrush current, (b) internal fault current, (c) saturated\nfault current, (d) saturated inrush current, (e) arc fault current.\nalgorithms are widely used to discriminate inrush currents\nand internal fault currents [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20].\nCategory 5: Methods based on artificial intelligence algo-\nrithms, including artificial neural networks [21], [22], [23],\n[24], [25], fuzzy control [26], random forest [27], and K\nnearest neighbor-genetic [28]. Their reliability depends on\nthe effectiveness of the used algorithms, the completeness of\nthe training samples and the empirical knowledge.\nCategory 6: Other methods [29], [30], [31].\nMany of them are very ingenious and interesting. However,\nthey face challenges from one or more of following interfer-\nences.\n1) Saturated fault current. If a fault current suffers current\ntransformer (CT) saturation, its waveform on the secondary\nside of CT will no longer present sinusoidal features. There\nwill be dead-angle and serious second harmonic components,\nas shown in Fig. 1(c). This may have adverse impacts on\nidentification methods, such as [15], [19], [22], and [28].\n2) Saturated inrush current. When affected by CT satura-\ntion, the magnetizing inrush waveform under saturation state\nis distorted, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The distortion changes the\ndead-angle feature of magnetizing inrush current, which can\nlead to the incorrect act of differential protections. Nonethe-\nless, except for [17] and [26], saturated inrush current is not\ninvolved in aforementioned studies.\n3) Arc fault current. An arc fault will cause nonlinear\ndistortion, as shown in Fig. 1(e). The distorted waveform\nis similar to the saturated fault current. The appearance of\ndead-angle affects the identification of the fault current, caus-\ning the protection to be incorrectly blocked. However, this\ncase is rarely covered in aforementioned studies.\nFIGURE 2. Classification of five kinds of transformer current signals.\nFor improvement, a new method is proposed to not only\ndistinguish between conventional magnetizing inrush current\nand conventional fault current, but also address the aforemen-\ntioned situations. Compared with other existing methods, the\nproposed method is able to more reliably work under multiple\ninterferences, including magnetizing inrush with/without CT\nsaturation, short-circuit faults with/without CT saturation,\nas well as arc faults in transformers.\nII. DISTINGUISHING PRINCIPLES OF TRANSFORMER\nCURRENT SIGNALS\nFig. 1 displays five kinds of transformer current signals. They\nare taken from actual field. In this paper, they will be clas-\nsified into two categories as shown in Fig. 2. Conventional\nfault current, saturated fault current, and arc fault current\nare generated by faults which must be cleared by differen-\ntial protection. Conventional magnetizing inrush current and\nsaturated inrush current are generated by non-fault condition\nwhich should not lead to the action of differential protection.\nSimplified classification steps are presented as follows.\nStep 1: Distinguishing unidirectional magnetizing inrush\ncurrent from all other signals. After all, only the magnetizing\ninrush current may exhibit unidirectional waveform charac-\nteristics.\nStep 2: Distinguishing bidirectional (or saturated) magne-\ntizing inrush current from fault current of all kinds.\nIn short, the unidirectional magnetizing inrush signal is\nselected by step 1, and the rest is further classified by step 2.\nThe specific classification principles and procedures are\npresented in detail below.\nA. DISTINGUISHING UNIDIRECTIONAL MAGNETIZING\nINRUSH CURRENT FROM ALL OTHER SIGNALS\n1) PROBLEM ANALYSIS\nAfter observing the waveform distribution pattern of these\nsignals, it can be found that they take on two kinds of forms.\nOne is the unidirectional current, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The\nother is the bidirectional current, as shown in Fig. 1(b)-(e).\nHence, the signal shown in Fig. 1(a) can be easily selected by\nits unidirectional waveform feature. The reason for the uni-\ndirectional characteristics of the magnetizing inrush current\nis that part of the magnetizing inrush current contains a large\namount of nonperiodic components, skewing to one side of\nthe time axis.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 45951\nP. Liu et al.: Countermeasure to Prevent Transformer Differential Protection From False Operations\nIt is important to note that magnetizing inrush currents are\nnot all unidirectional. In some cases, some of them are also\nbidirectional, especially in Y/d connected transformers.\nA unidirectional index (U I) is defined to compose a quick\nprepositive criterion. Once it is satisfied, the differential cur-\nrent will be directly judged to be a magnetizing inrush current,\nand subsequent procedures will not be carried out.\n2) UNIDIRECTIONAL INDEX\nThe UI value is obtained by (1).\nUI =\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐\nN∑\nr=1\nIr\n⏐\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐\n/ N∑\nr=1\n|Ir | (1)\nwhere Ir is the r-th sample value of the differential current, N\nis the number of samples in one fundamental frequency cycle.\nThe quick prepositive criterion is expressed as\nUI > Uset (2)\nThe unidirectional characteristic of the waveform is\nexpressed by the value of UI. The numerator of UI represents\nthe sum of sample values within a fundamental frequency\nperiod. The denominator of UI is a reference value. For the\nunidirectional magnetizing inrush current signal, the obtained\nvalues of the numerator and denominator in (1) are similar,\nso that the obtained value of UI is very close to 1. Different\nfrom this, the denominator of other bidirectional current is\nmuch greater than its numerator. Consequently, the threshold\nUset is set to 0.8. If the obtained value of UI is greater than the\nthreshold, it will be identified as a unidirectional magnetizing\ninrush current. Otherwise, it will go to Step 2 for the next\nidentification.\nFor the convenience of following descriptions, the above\nidentification based on the unidirectional index is referred to\nas the criterion 1.\nB. DISTINGUISHING BIDIRECTIONAL (OR SATURATED)\nMAGNETIZING INRUSH CURRENT FROM FAULT CURRENT\nOF ALL KINDS\n1) WAVEFORM FILTERING\na: FILTERING PRINCIPLE\nThe sinusoidal characteristic is one of the characteristics that\nis often used to distinguish internal fault currents from mag-\nnetizing inrush currents. It describes the difference between\nthe differential current waveform and the standard sinusoidal\nwaveform. As shown in Fig. 1, the waveform of fault current\nsignals (e.g. Fig. 1(b)) approximates a sinusoidal waveform,\nwhile the waveform of magnetizing inrush current is different\nfrom the sinusoidal waveform (e.g. Fig. 1(a)).\nHowever, the saturated fault current is an exception, due\nto the distortion caused by saturation. This is described in\nFig. 3. The saturated fault current waveform and standard\nsinusoidal waveform are represented by the black scatter and\nred curve respectively. It is obvious that there is a difference\nbetween them, which must be considered. As shown in Fig. 3,\nFIGURE 3. Saturated fault current waveform and standard sinusoidal\nwaveform.\nFIGURE 4. Arc fault current waveform and standard sinusoidal waveform.\nthese differences are mainly manifested in dead-angles pro-\nduced by the distortion (e.g. ① and ② ), as well as transition\nprocesses before dead-angles (e.g. ③ and ④). The reason is\nthat the CT remanence and the nonperiodic component of\nthe CT primary current cause CT saturation and distortion of\nthe CT secondary current waveform. When the transformer is\nrunning with a fault, the CT saturation becomes more serious\nunder the influence of CT remanence, which is more likely to\nlead to incorrect action of protection. Similarly, excessive dif-\nferential current amplitude is also a cause of saturation. The\nabove distortions easily lead to a saturated fault current being\nmisjudged as a magnetizing inrush current, which challenges\nthe validity of the algorithms based on sinusoidal similarity.\nTo solve these problems, a waveform filtering scheme is\nadopted to address these waveform distortions, as follows:\nFirstly, eliminate data of dead-angles, such as ① and ② in\nFig. 3. Then, eliminate data of transition processes near dead\nangles, such as ③ and ④ in Fig. 3.\nAfter eliminating these waveform data, the difference\nbetween residual saturated fault current data and standard\nsinusoidal data becomes very small.\nSimilarly, the waveform of the arc fault current signal also\ndeviates from the standard sinusoidal waveform. As shown in\nFig. 4, the distortion type of the arc fault current is similar to\nthe saturated fault current described above. After the wave-\nform distortion interference is eliminated by the above two\nsteps, the difference between residual arc fault current data\nand standard sinusoidal data will be greatly reduced.\nb: SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES OF THE\nWAVEFORM FILTERING SCHEME\nThe maximum value MC is obtained according to (3)\nMC = max\n1≤r≤N\n(|Ir |) (3)\nwhere Ir is the r-th sample datum in a fundamental frequency\nperiod.\n45952 VOLUME 11, 2023\nP. Liu et al.: Countermeasure to Prevent Transformer Differential Protection From False Operations\nFIGURE 5. Data point of saturated fault current after interference\nfiltering. (a) data point after eliminating dead-angles, (b) data point after\neliminating transition processes near dead-angles.\nThe sampled data are monitored in real time. Once (4) is\nsatisfied, the interference data will be found and filtered out.\nAfter filtering out this interference, the result of the saturated\nfault current is shown in Fig. 5(a).\n|Ir | < 0.15MC (1 ≤ r ≤ N) (4)\nIt can be found that the remaining sample data after imple-\nmenting this filtering step are no longer continuous. For all\nIr which satisfies (4), the values of r are recorded in {d h} in\nturn.\nThen, if (5) is further satisfied, N/20 data of transition\nprocesses near dead angles will be further eliminated.\n(dh − dh−1) > N\n10 (h = L, L − 1, · · ·, 2) (5)\nwhere L represents the total number of remaining signal data\nafter aforementioned data elimination is implemented.\nThe question is whether the transition data are on the left\nor the right. This paper answers this question according to\nthe slope magnitude. If (6) is satisfied, the data on the left\nside will be filtered out. Otherwise, the right side is filtered\nout. ⏐⏐⏐⏐Idh − Idh− N\n20\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐>\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐Idh+1 − Idh+1+ N\n20\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐ (6)\nwhere h represents the value which satisfies (5).\nAfter implementing the above waveform filtering steps,\nFig. 5(b) is obtained.\n2) QUARTERING-BASED SIMILARITY INDEX\nThe above-mentioned waveform filtering principle already\ndeals well with the waveform distortions of the saturated fault\ncurrent and the arc fault current. In this part, the interference\nof the saturated inrush current will be further considered.\nFig. 6 shows a saturated inrush current signal after waveform\nfiltering. A standard sinusoidal waveform is also shown as\na reference. After observing these two curves, it can be\nfound that there is no remarkable difference between the satu-\nrated inrush waveform and the standard sinusoidal waveform,\nwhich is not conducive to judgement.\nFIGURE 6. Overall fitting of a saturated inrush current signal.\nTo overcome these shortcomings, a quartering-based fit-\nting scheme is proposed to take the place of overall fitting.\nThe residual sample data after filtering are recorded in, and\ndivided into four equal parts. They are respectively expressed\nas {I∗\n1 , I∗\n2 , · · ·, I∗\nB}, {I∗\nB+1, · · ·, I∗\n2B}, {I∗\n2B+1, · · ·, I∗\n3B}, and\n{I∗\n3B+1, · · ·, I∗\nm}. The first part and the fourth part are com-\nbined to build the matrix Y, and the second part and the third\npart are combined to build the matrix Z as (7).\n{\nY = [I∗\n1 , · · ·, I∗\nB, I∗\n3B+1, · · ·, I∗\nm]T\nZ = [I∗\nB+1, · · ·, I∗\n2B, I∗\n2B+1, · · ·, I∗\n3B]T (7)\nwhere the variable B can be obtained by (8).\nB = ⌊m/4⌋ (8)\nwhere m indicates the total number of residual sample data\nafter implementing the above waveform filtering scheme in\none cycle; the rounding symbol (⌊⌋) means that fractions are\nrounded down.\nThe Y and Z are fitted respectively.

Fig. 7(a) and\nFig. 7(b) respectively show the fitting results through Y and\nZ, respectively. The difference between residual sample data\nand obtained fitting results is obvious. Compared with Fig. 6,\nthe difference in Fig. 7 is more evident, which is convenient\nfor conducting the identification.\nIn addition, the saturated fault currents and arc fault cur-\nrents after filtering have good sinusoidal characteristics, and\nthe obtained QSI values are always small after the above\nfitting is performed.\nGiven the above, the value of the QSI is utilized for the\nidentification in this paper.\nAccording to the QSI, we can distinguish magnetizing\ninrush current and various fault current. Concretely, if the\ncalculated QSI of a signal is greater than the threshold (R set),\nthe signal will be identified as a magnetizing inrush current,\nand the differential protection will block. Otherwise, it is\nFIGURE 8. Flowchart of the proposed method.\nFIGURE 9. Simulation system for studies and evaluations.\nidentified as a fault current, and the differential protection will\nbe allowed to operate.\nIt is common knowledge that a good fitting result is the\nsame as the original signal. Therefore, the calculated QSI\nvalue in the case of an internal fault is very small, close to 0.\nIn contrast, the calculated QSI value under magnetizing inrush\ncurrent is much greater than that under fault condition. The\nthreshold (Rset) aims at a certain margin, and it is determined\naccording to sufficient simulation tests. Overall, the threshold\n(Rset) is 0.25.\nFor the convenience of the following descriptions, the\nabove identification based on the quartering-based similarity\nindex is referred to as criterion 2.\nC. DISTINGUISHING PROCEDURES\nAccording to the proposed principles and criteria, distin-\nguishing steps are given in the following figure.\nIII. SIMULATION STUDIES AND EVALUATIONS\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method\nunder various conditions, a simulation system using\nPSCAD/EMTDC is established as shown in Fig. 9. The\nsimulation system includes a 220/110 kV , 100 MV A, Y/△\nconnected transformer. The parameter settings of the trans-\nformer and current transformer in the simulation system are\nshown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.\nAfter operating the simulation system, secondary current\nsignals of CTs are sampled at a sampling frequency of 4 kHz.\nThe obtained sample data are downloaded to MATLAB\n45954 VOLUME 11, 2023\nP.

For\ndifferent kinds of signals, the test results are as follows.\nA. CONVENTIONAL MAGNETIZING INRUSH CURRENT\nMagnetizing inrush currents are generated due to the rema-\nnent magnetism of the power transformer and the no-load\nclosing time. The closing angle can affect the waveform\ncharacteristics of the inrush current, while the remanent\nmagnetism mainly affects its amplitude. According to the\nsimulation model, two different forms of inrush currents are\nobtained and shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11.\nAccording to the proposed discrimination steps, the UI\nvalues of the current signal data, as shown in Fig. 10(a), are\ncalculated, and the results are shown in Fig. 10(b). The dotted\nblue line indicates the threshold Uset. It is easy to find that the\nFIGURE 12. Simulation result of the internal fault current. (a) current\nsignal, (b) obtained unidirectional index, (c) obtained quartering-based\nsimilarity index.\nobtained UI values are always higher than the threshold Uset.\nAccording to the previously proposed criterion 1, the signal\nwill be judged as a unidirectional magnetizing inrush current.\nFor the bidirectional magnetizing inrush current signal in\nFig. 11(a), the calculated UI values are always less than the\nthreshold Uset, as shown in Fig. 11(b), which confirms that the\nsignal is identified as a bidirectional signal. Then, a further\njudgment is conducted according to the previously proposed\ncriterion 2. As shown in Fig. 11(c), the obtained QSI values\nare always greater than the threshold Rset. Therefore, the\nsignal will be further identified as a bidirectional magnetizing\ninrush current.\nAdditionally, different iron saturation curves of the iron\ncore can be obtained by varying the air core reactance, knee\nvoltage. In this section, various magnetizing inrush condi-\ntions with different iron saturation curves, magnetizing cur-\nrents and remanent fluxes are simulated to test the correctness\nof the proposed detection method. The test results indicate\nthat the method in this paper is able to accurately identify var-\nious conventional inrush currents and block the transformer\ndifferential protection.\nB. INTERNAL THREE-PHASE SHORT-CIRCUIT FAULT\nCURRENT\nThrough the simulation model, a three-phase short-circuit\nfault located in the differential protection zone is simu-\nlated, and the obtained differential current signal is shown in\nFig. 12(a). Here, phase A is used as an example to test the\nproposed method.\nAccording to the sample data of this current signal, cal-\nculated UI values are presented in Fig. 12(b) in graphic form.\nThese obtained values of UI are always in the region less than\nUset. On the basis of the proposed distinguishing procedures,\nthis signal needs to be further classified by means of the QSI\nmentioned in criterion 2. The calculated results of the QSI are\nshown in Fig. 12(c). It is clear that the threshold Rset is larger\nthan the obtained values of QSI, so that the signal will be\nclassified as a fault current. There is a large margin between\nthem, which can avoid misjudgment.\nC.

This has an adverse effect on\ntransformer protection. However, the existing studies are less\ninvolved in the CT saturation interference situation, and the\nexisting methods are weak against CT saturation interference.\nIn this section, the current transformer ratio of 300 A / 5 A\nis selected to simulate the CT saturation case through PSCAD\nsoftware. The simulation experiment of no-load closing with\nfault is carried out on the high-voltage side of the transformer.\nThe saturated inrush wave obtained on the secondary side\nof the CT is shown in Fig. 13. Waveform distortion can\nbe obviously observed in the figure, and there is no dead-\nangle. According to the unidirectional index in criterion 1,\nthe current signal is determined to be a bidirectional current.\nThen, based on criterion 2, the QSI values are calculated and\nshown in Fig. 13(b). Given that the calculated QSI values are\ngreater than Rset, the signal will be judged to be a magnetizing\ninrush current.\nSimilarly, different saturation excitation inrush currents\ncan be obtained by varying the number of turns on the primary\nand secondary sides of the CT, the area and the burden\nresistance in Table 2. The method proposed in this study\nsuccessfully determined them as inrush currents and blocked\nthe transformer differential protection.\nD. INTERNAL FAULT CURRENT WITH CT SATURATION\nTo simulate the short-circuit fault with CT saturation, the\nratio of CT is set as 600 A / 5 A. After implementing\nthe simulation, the saturated fault current signal shown in\nFig. 14(a) is obtained. The waveform of this signal is no\nlonger strictly sinusoidal, and there are dead-angles near zero\ncrossing points.\nThe signal is judged as a bidirectional current by crite-\nrion 1. Then, the QSI values are calculated by criterion 2.\nAccording to the calculated QSI values, it is determined that\nthe current signal is a fault current.\nVarious saturated fault currents are simulated by varying\nthe parameters in Table 2. The proposed method successfully\ndetermines them as fault currents.\nFIGURE 15. Simulation result of arc fault current.

ARC FAULT CURRENT\nIn this paper, the Mayr model is selected to simulate arc fault.\nAfter all, it is considered to be a common and practical arc\nmodel. In the Mayr model, the arc time constant is 0.6 ms,\nthe heat dissipation power is 3.8 MW, the arc conductivity\nis 1000 S, and the grounding resistance is 100 . The arc\nmodel based on Mayr theory is connected to a side of the\ntransformer. After no-load closing the transformer with an arc\nfault, the arc fault current is generated. The obtained current\nsignal and calculated values QSI are shown in Fig. 15. Due\nto QSI < Rset, the signal is recognized as a fault current\nby the proposed method. This is consistent with the default\ncase.\nF. OTHER INTERFERENCE TEST\nIn order to further verify the effectiveness of the algorithm,\ntransformer internal short-circuit fault simulation tests with\nthe presence of converter-interfaced sources are carried out.\nObtained transformer differential current signals are shown\nin Fig. 16(a)-(c), and changing values of computed QSI are\ndisplayed in Fig. 16(d)-(f). Calculated QSI values are always\nless than Rset, so these signals will be accurately judged as\nfault currents.\nWhat needs illustration is that this paper mainly focuses\non magnetizing inrush with/without CT saturation, short-\ncircuit fault with/without CT saturation, as well as arc fault\nin transformers. For other interference cases, further research\nis still needed in the follow-up work.\nIV. EXPERIMENT TEST STUDIES\nThree experimental ways are used to evaluate the immunity\nfrom interference and the reliability in practical engineering.\n45956 VOLUME 11, 2023\nP. Liu et al.: Countermeasure to Prevent Transformer Differential Protection From False Operations\nFIGURE 17. Connection diagram of actual transformer test.\nFIGURE 18. Recording analysis diagram.\nA. EXPERIMENT WAY 1: ACTUAL TRANSFORMER TEST\nAn actual transformer simulation test is carried out in the\nPower System Dynamic Simulation Laboratory of a Chinese\nuniversity. The experimental logical diagram for obtaining\nmagnetizing inrush current signals and internal fault cur-\nrent signals is shown in Fig. 17. Three single-phase three-\nwinding 6.67 kV A 50 Hz transformers are used to compose\na 1000 V/1000 V/400 V Y/Y/△ three-phase transformer.\nSpecifically, a magnetizing inrush current is generated\nthrough no-load closing the transformer, while a two-phase\nshort-circuit fault is set to generate a fault current through the\nfault simulation cabinet located on the high voltage side of the\ntransformer. It should be noted that the existing transformer\nprotection device uses the second harmonic restraint prin-\nciple to identify signals. After this experiment, the existing\ntransformer protection device displays event reports, and the\nwave recorder uploads the signal waveform. The obtained\ninformation is shown in Fig. 18 and Fig. 19, which indicates\nthe ability of the existing device to identify the conventional\nmagnetizing inrush current and fault current. The proposed\nmethod is also used to address these current signals, and the\ncorrect test results are also obtained.\nB. EXPERIMENT WAY 2: ACTUAL DATA PLAYBACK TEST\nDuring previous study works, several field recorded signal\ndata (COMTRADE file) were obtained from a higher voltage\nlevel system in the actual field. In this experimental way, these\nactual field data are sent again back to the protective devices\nby means of a MP3000 protective relaying tester.\nFIGURE 19. Test result of internal fault current.\nFIGURE 20. Fiber channel connection diagram of the signal playback\nexperiment.\nFIGURE 21. Test result of the fault with CT saturation.\nThe transient playback function of the protective relaying\ntester is used to playback the actual field recorded signal\ndata (from a 220 kV/69 kV/10.5 kV , 120 MV A transformer)\nto evaluate the influence of CT saturation interference. The\nconnection diagram is shown in Fig. 20. Due to CT saturation\ninterference, the protection action time is delayed by 45 ms,\nso that the fault cannot be removed in time by the existing\ntransformer protection device.\nThe same actual field recorded signals are used to test\nthe proposed method, and correct results similar to those\nin Fig. 14 are obtained. Compared with Fig. 21, the pro-\nposed method operates quickly without delay. Besides, other\nfield recorded signals from transformers of other voltage\nlevels and capacities (e.g. 535 kV/210.4 kV , 892.8 MV A;\n110 kV/10.5 kV , 20 MV A) are also used to test the proposed\nmethod, the obtained QSI values proved the practicability of\nthe proposed method in practical engineering. Due to space\nlimitation, they have not listed here.\nC. EXPERIMENT WAY 3: FAULT TEST BY USING AN\nEXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM\nThe arc fault experimental platform as shown in Fig. 22(a)\nis set up. The experimental platform is mainly composed\nVOLUME 11, 2023 45957\nP. Liu et al.: Countermeasure to Prevent Transformer Differential Protection From False Operations\nTABLE 3.

One end of the\narc generation device is a copper rod, and the other end\nis a carbon rod. After the circuit is energized, the copper\nrod moves slowly toward the carbon rod. When the copper\nrod is very close to the carbon rod, an arc fault current is\nproduced. Then, the oscilloscope collects the arc current by\nmeasuring the sampling resistor. The obtained arc current\nsignal is shown in Fig. 22(b), and test results for different\nkinds of algorithms are listed in the last row of Table 3.\nV. COMPARISONS AND ANALYSES\nA. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON WITH TRADITIONAL\nMETHODS\nIn this section, 20 ms data of the aforementioned experiment\nsignals after protection startup are selected and imported into\nMATLAB. For comparison, these data are used to assess\nthe performance of the traditional second harmonic restraint\nprinciple, traditional dead-angle principle and the method\nproposed in this paper. The results are listed in Table 3.\nExisting methods have disadvantages in the face of CT\nsaturation and arc fault interference. The second harmonic\nrestraint principle fails to correctly identify the saturated fault\ncurrent, which also leads to the failure shown in Fig. 21. The\ndead-angle principle also misjudges the saturated inrush cur-\nrent, saturated fault current, and arc fault current. However,\nthe proposed method does not have these problems.\nB. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON WITH METHODS\nBASED ON THE WAVEFORM SIMILARITY PRINCIPLE\nIn recent years, methods based on the waveform similarity\nprinciple have been proposed to improve the action accuracy\nof transformer differential protection. Commonly, these algo-\nrithms fit all current signal data in a cycle as a whole, and then\nthe coefficient of sinusoidal similarity (R 2) is calculated.\nThe aforementioned simulation and experimental signals\nare also fitted and analyzed. The coefficient of sinusoidal sim-\nilarity is used as the basis of judgment. Results are obtained\nas shown in Table 3. It can be found that the methods based on\nthe waveform similarity principle will misjudge the saturated\ninrush current as a fault current.\nIn contrast, there is no misjudgment caused by the method\nproposed in this paper, as shown in Table 3.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis paper presented a novel discrimination method based on\na unidirectional index and quartering-based similarity index.\nIt can be applied in intelligent substation as a countermea-\nsure to prevent transformer differential protections from false\noperations caused by multiple interferences, including mag-\nnetizing inrush conditions, CT saturation conditions, and arc\nfault conditions.\nConcretely, the unidirectional index can effectively detect\nand identify unidirectional inrush signals. The waveform\ndifference between saturated inrush current and the stan-\ndard sinusoidal current is not significant, which may cause\nthe overall fitting fit to produce incorrect results. The\nquartering-based fitting and the QSI value can overcome\nthis shortcoming. The QSI value of bidirectional inrush\ncurrent or saturated inrush current is significantly greater\nthan that of internal fault current, saturated fault cur-\nrent, or arc fault current. Therefore, the quartering-based\nsimilarity index can be utilized to implement further\nclassification.\nThe method based on waveform similarity principle,\nas well as traditional methods including the second harmonic\nrestraint principle and dead-angle principle, may face mis-\njudgments, due to one or more of the aforementioned interfer-\nences, which lead to the false operation or delay operation of\ntransformer differential protections. Whereas, the proposed\nmethod has been proved to be more advantageous in dealing\nwith these interferences.\nThis paper mainly focuses on aforementioned interfer-\nences. For other interference cases, further research is still\nneeded in the follow-up work.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I. Žiger, B. Trkulja, and Ž.
