I n t r o d u c tIo n\nIndividual differences have been studied extensively by experts in foreign language \n(FL) learning, i.e., language anxiety and language motivation. Both of these constructs \nhave been found to be highly correlated to FL achievement. However, relatively few studies \nhave examined the role of these two constructs simultaneously in the context of English \nas a foreign language (EFL). Exploring the relationship between language motivation and \nlanguage anxiety and their combined effects on the EFL achievement will help language \nteachers and researchers to clarify the role of these two variables in language pedagogy. \nThe purpose of the present study is to accomplish such a task and examine the relationship \nbetween language anxiety and language motivation, and their effects on language achieve -\nment within a foreign context.\n1.1. Foreign Language Anxiety\nIt is widely believed that learning a foreign language can be a stressful activity for \nsome learners (Hewitt & Stefenson, 2011). Many researchers have, therefore, examined the \nrole of anxiety in language learning since early 1970s (e.g. MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991; \nPhillips, 1992; Aida, 1994; Gardner, 2005). Their findings have shown that there is a negative \nrelationship between FL anxiety and the level of achievement.\nForeign language anxiety has been described by employing different categorizations \n(Dorneyi, 2005). Two of the most well-known classifications are trait-state (Speilberger, \n1983) and facilitating-debilitating (Scovel, 1978) views of anxiety. The former states that \ntrait anxiety is stable over time, while state anxiety is a transient and moment-to-moment \nfeeling. The latter proposes that anxiety does not necessarily impede learning, and in some \ncases it could improve language performance and have a positive effect on language leaning. \nIn other words, while debilitating anxiety has negative impact on learners’ performance, \nfacilitating anxiety can actually enhance it.\nMacIntyre (1999) defined foreign language anxiety as “worry and negative emotional \nreaction aroused when learning or using a second language” (p.27). Horwitz, Horwitz, and \nCope (1986) identified three types of foreign language anxiety: communication apprehension, \nfear of negative evaluation, and test anxiety. They also developed a 33-item questionnaire, \nForeign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) to measure language anxiety. Following \nthis, many studies have been conducted on language anxiety. Although few studies have \nshown a positive relationship between language anxiety and language achievement (e.g., Liu, \n2006; Oxford, 1999), most of them have shown that language anxiety is negatively related \nto language achievement (e.g., MacIntyre, 1999; Horwitz, 2001; MacIntyre, Noels, Clement, \n1997). In other words, the more proficiency learners gain in the EFL, the less anxiety they \nexperience in learning it. \nForeign language anxiety is common among foreign language learners (Young, 1991) \nand it is seen as one of the great obstacles of FL learning and achievement. Therefore, lower \nachievement with higher anxiety is attributed to negative effects of anxiety on language \nlearning (Tóth, 2007; MacIntyre, 1999, 2002; Horwitz, 2000, 2001). \neb r a h i m kh o d a d a dY a n d gh oLa m ha s s a n kh a j aV Y Exploring the Role of Anxiety and...\n271\n1.2. Language Motivation\nDörnyei (2005) stated that motivation “provides the primary impetus to initiate FL \nlearning and later the driving force to sustain language and often tedious learning process” \n(p. 65). Therefore, motivation is also one of the important affective factors that influence \nlanguage learning. Research on motivation in second language learning started with the \nwork of social psychologists Gardner and Lambert (1972) and Gardner (1985). They stated \nthat language learning is affected by socio-cultural factors. Consequently, Gardner (1985) \nproposed the socio-educational model of second language acquisition. In this model, two \nvariables, integrativeness and attitudes toward the learning situation are related to the learners’ \nsociocultural environment. Integrativeness consists of integrative orientation, attitudes toward \nFL community, and interest in foreign languages. Attitudes toward the learning situation \nrefer to the evaluation of the language teacher and the FL course. Since integrativeness and \nattitudes toward the learning situation contribute to the learners’ level of motivation, these \nthree classes of variables have been called integrative motivation (Gardener, 1985).\nHowever, the social-psychological framework has undergone criticism for being em -\nployed in foreign language learning contexts where there is little or no contact with people \nfrom the target language. To overcome this shortcoming, and by the emergence of cognitive \nschool in educational psychology, researchers draw on the distinction between intrinsic and \nextrinsic motivation to overcome the criticism in language leaning (e.g., Noels, Pelletier, \nClement, & Vallerand, 2000). It is based on self-determination theory proposed by Deci \nand Ryan (1985) and widely used in educational psychology. Intrinsic motivation refers to \ninternal desire to perform an action because it is enjoyable and satisfying. When learning is \nperceived as goal in itself and students find the task interesting and challenging, they become \nintrinsically motivated (Ehrman, Leaver, & Oxford, 2003). Extrinsic motivation, however, \ncomes from external factors driving learning for instrumental goals such as earning reward \nor avoiding punishment. \nNoels et al. (2000) applied self-determination theory to FL research. They identified \nthree types of intrinsic motivation. The first type is knowledge, motivation to do an activity \nfor exploring new ideas and knowledge. The second deals with accomplishment, sensations \nfor achieving a goal or a task. The third type of intrinsic motivation involves stimulation, \nfun and excitement stimulated by doing a task. \nSimilarly, Noels et al. (2000) identified three types of extrinsic motivation that vary \nin their level of self-determination. The least self-determined type of extrinsic motivation \nis external regulation, which refers to the activities that are external to the learner, such as \ntangible benefits and costs. The second type of extrinsic motivation which is more internal \nis introjected regulation. It refers to performing an activity due to some kind of internal \npressure such as avoiding guilt or ego-enhancement. The most self regulated type of extrinsic \nmotivation is identified regulation. Students carry out an action due to personally related \nreasons and attaining a valued goal. \nRamage (1990) showed that intrinsic motivation contributes more strongly to second \nlanguage achievement than extrinsic motivation. Without focusing on the degree of contri -\nbution to learning, Noels et al. (2000), however, stated that when students have no reason, \nintrinsic or extrinsic, to do an action they will leave the activity as soon as they find a more \nmotivating goal to pursue. \nPo r t a Li n g u a r u m Nº 20, junio 2013\n272\n1.3. FL Language Anxiety and FL Motivation\nThe relationship between language motivation and language anxiety has been investi -\ngated by some researchers. In their studies, they have treated anxiety either as a separate \nfactor in its own right or as a secondary factor of FL self-confidence. When considered as \na distinct variable, FL anxiety was found to be negatively related to FL motivation (e.g., \nGardner & Lalonde, 1987; Hashimoto, 2002). As a secondary factor of FL self-confidence, \nanxiety was, however, related to self confidence gained as a result of perceived communica -\ntive competence (e.g., Clement, 1980, 1986) Lack of anxiety is thus viewed as a predictor \nof FL self-confidence characterizing motivated language learners. \nAlso, the relationship between FL anxiety and self-determination theory of language \nlearning motivation has been examined by some researchers such as Toth (2007) and Liu and \nHuang (2011). These scholars have shown that anxiety is positively and significantly related \nto amotivation. They have, however, found that anxiety is more significantly correlated with \nextrinsic motivation than with intrinsic motivation. \n1.4. English Language Instruction in Iran\nFormal instruction of EFL in Iranian educational system starts from the first year of \njunior high school (Papi & Abdollahzade, in press). Dominant method of EFL teaching \nin Iran is Audiolingualism and Grammar Translation Method in which the emphasis is on \nlearning new lists of vocabulary, explicit teaching of grammar, and reading and translating \nthe texts followed by doing some drills and exercises. Since speaking and listening skills \nare largely ignored in state high schools for a number of reasons such as class times and \nfacilities, a large number of students go to private language institutes to develop and improve \ntheir speaking and listening skills. \nAlthough some studies have examined the FLFL motivation and FLFL anxiety experienced \nby university or school students in Iranian EFL context, there is still a lack of research on \nFL motivation and FL anxiety of language learners in the informal and communicative-based \ncontext of Iranian private language institutes. The primary purpose of the present study is, \ntherefore, to investigate the relationship of FL motivation and FL anxiety in informal context \nof private language institutes in Iran. Also, a foreign language achievement model based on \nthe FL anxiety and FL motivation will be examined in this context. \n1.5. Research questions\n 1. What is the relationship between motivation and foreign language anxiety in Iranian \nEFL context?\n 2. Which types of motivation predict the students’ foreign language anxiety in Iranian \nEFL context?\n 3. Does the proposed model of foreign language achievement based on FL anxiety and \nFL motivation show enough adequacy for Iranian EFL context?\neb r a h i m kh o d a d a dY a n d gh oLa m ha s s a n kh a j aV Y Exploring the Role of Anxiety and...\n273\n2. M e t h o d\n2.1. Participants\nA total of 264 (111 male and 153 female) EFL learners from an Iranian private English \nlanguage institute in Kashmar city took part in this study. Ages ranged from 16 to 44 (mean= \n23.18, SD= 4.51). All the participants were at the proficiency level of lower intermediate and \nintermediate. Further descriptive statistics of the participants is presented in Table 1.\nTable 1. Participants’ descriptive statistics. \nCategory Sub-category Number Percent\nNationality Iranian 264 100\nEducational status High school student 40 15.15\nUniversity student 124 47\nGraduate student 100 37.85\nProficiency level Lower-intermediate 142 53.78\nIntermediate 122 46.22\nMarital status Single 197 74.6\nMarried 67 25.4\n2.2. Materials\nThe books used for teaching the EFL in the institute where data were collected are \nInterchange series written by Richards, Hull and Proctor (2005). The exams are based on \nthe tests designed by the authors in the Teacher’s edition of the same books. They measure \nthe reading, writing, speaking, and listening abilities of learners according to the units taught \nduring the school semesters. Each of these tests has a maximum score of 25. The learners’ \nperformance is thus reported on a scale ranging from zero to 100 at the end of each se -\nmester. After getting the official approval of the authorities of the institute, the final scores \nof the participants in the four skills were obtained from the registrar’s office as objective \nmeasures of learners’ EFL achievement. \n2.3. Instruments\nTwo questionnaires were used in this study, i.e., Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety \nScale and Language Learning Orientations Scale (LLOS). These questionnaires have been \nwell validated and widely used in language learning literature. They were translated into the \nPersian language by the researchers on the basis of schema theory (e.g., Khodadady, 2001, \n2008; Seif & Khodadady, 2003). Based on this theory, all the words constituting the items \nwere translated by employing their semantic, syntactic, and discoursal relationships with each \nPo r t a Li n g u a r u m Nº 20, junio 2013\n274\nother and their best Persian equivalents were chosen by employing the same relationships \ngoverning the Persian equivalents. For example, while the noun phrase “second language” \nappears in the English version of the LLOS, it was replaced by the single noun Persian \nequivalent INGILISI (English) because in the context/discourse of the present research is \nrefers only to this specific foreign language. \n2.3.1. Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale\nThe Persian version of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale developed by \nHorwitz et al. (1986) was employed in this study. It is the most well-known scale used for \nmeasuring anxiety and stress in foreign language classrooms. Participants answered 33 items \npresented on a Likert-type scale having seven points and ranging from it does not apply to \nme at all  to it applies to me completely . The alpha reliability coefficient reported for the \nEnglish FLCAS is .93. \n2.3.2. FL Language Learning Orientations Scale (LLOS)\nThe Persian version of Language Learning Orientations Scale (LLOS) was utilized to \nassess motivation of participants in this study. It was developed by Noels et al., (2003) to \nmeasure amotivation, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. It consists of twenty \none items whose seven points range from it does not apply to me at all  to it applies to me \ncompletely. Noels et al. administered the LLOS to 159 native speakers of English learning \nFrensh as a second language an obtained the alpha reliability coefficients of .82, .75, .67, \n.84, .85, .88 and .85 for amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified \nregulation, intrinsic motivation- knowledge, intrinsic motivation- accomplishment and intrinsic \nmotivation- stimulation, respectively. \n2.4. Procedure\nThe researchers talked to eight English teachers offering lower and upper intermediate \ncourses in the specified institute and asked for their cooperation in giving the questionnaires \nto their students during the regular class time. All of them agreed to cooperate and permit -\nted the researchers to use their class time for distributing the questionnaires. Participants \ncompleted them in fifteen minutes in July, 2011. Researchers were present in the classrooms \nwhen the participants filled out the questionnaires. Since both scales were in their mother \nlanguage no questions were raised by th e participants. \n3. re s uLt s\n3.1. Exploratory factor analysis\nExploratory factor analysis was run to examine the underlying structure of FLCAS \nand LLOS. Principal axis factoring with promax rotation was performed independently for \nthe two scales. Since the KMO statistics obtained for the FLCAS and LLOS were .94 and \neb r a h i m kh o d a d a dY a n d gh oLa m ha s s a n kh a j aV Y Exploring the Role of Anxiety and...\n275\n.76, respectively, they showed that the sample selected in the study and the factor analysis \nemployed would probably provide the best common factors. The significant Bartlett’s Tests \nof Sphericity for FLCAS (X\n2 = 3780.151, df = 526, p < .0001) and LLOS (X 2 =2127.339, \ndf = 526, p < .0001) indicated that their correlation matrices were not identity matrices. \nUpon ensuring the suitability of factor analysis, the number of latent variables to be \nextracted was determined by adopting eigenvalues greater than one, factor loadings greater \nthan .40, and the scree plot test as criteria. Cross-loading and low loading factors were \nremoved. The analysis resulted in the extraction of four factors for the FLCAS accounting \nfor 51.49% of the variance. (Factor loadings are presented in Appendix A.) \nEight items loaded on factor1 (Anx1). These items were related to communication \nanxiety in English class. It was, therefore, named “English communication fear”. There were \nseven items loading on factor2 (Anx2). This factor reflected students’ fear of being negatively \nevaluated in English class. Thus, it was named “fear of negative evaluation”. Three items \nloaded on factor3 (Anx3). This factor indicated students’ attitude toward English class and \nwas named “negative attitude toward English”. Finally, five items loaded on factor5 (Anx4) \nThese items were related to students’ comfortableness and tension in English class. Therefore, \nthis factor was named “comfortableness with English class”. \nUpon specifying the latent variables underlying the FLCAS, the same extraction method \nwas applied to the LLOS. A six-factor solution was found for FL motivation accounting for \n57.16% of the variance for the scale. (Factor loadings are presented in Appendix B). The \nextracted factors, i.e., MO1, MO2, MO3, MO4, MO5, and MO6, corresponded to Noel et \nal.’s (2000) knowledge, amotivation, introjected regulation, accomplishment, identified re -\ngulation, and external regulation, respectively. Items related to stimulation, however, either \ncross-loaded on other factors or had factor loadings lower than .40 and thus were removed \nfrom the structure.\n Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics as well as Cronbach Alpha internal con -\nsistency reliability coefficients of the ten factors extracted from the FLCAS and LLOS. As \ncan be seen, among the factors amotivation and communication fear are the most and least \nreliable, i.e., α = .84 and .68, respectively. Since the former consists of only three items \nwhereas the latter comprises eight, the low reliability of communication fear might be at -\ntributed to the heterogeneity of its constituting items. \n Table 2.

As can be seen, amoti -\nvation was positively and significantly related to all four FLCAS subscales, indicating that \nthe EFL learners who are amotivated feel more anxious in the class than motivated students. \nAmong the three extrinsic motivation subscales, only External regulation was positively and \nsignificantly related to all FLCAS subscales except the Comfortableness. Introjected regulation \nwas also positively and significantly related to all FLCAS subscales except Comfortableness. \nHowever, Identified regulation, which is the most self regulated type of extrinsic motivation, \nwas negatively and significantly related to two of the FLCAS subscales, namely Comforta -\nbleness and Fear of negative evaluation.\nTable 3.

The \nresults of this study, therefore, show that intrinsic motivation subscales were negatively and \nsignificantly related to FLCAS subscales. Extrinsic motivation subscales, except Iden tified, were \nalso positively and significantly related to FLCAS subscales. The relationship between Identified \nregulation and FLCAS subscales was negative. They also reveal  a strong relation between FL \nmotivation and foreign language classroom anxiety. Th ese findings are in line with previous \nstudies (e.g., Liu & Huang, 2011; and MacIntyre, Baker, Clement, & Donovan, 2003). \n \n3.3. Regression Analyses \n In order to answer the second question, i.e., which types of motivation predict the \nstudents’ foreign language anxiety in Iranian EFL context, multiple regressions were performed. \nTo fulfill the function, six motivational subscales were regressed onto each of four FLCAS \nsubtypes and the total foreign language anxiety to obtain the results presented in Table  4. As can \nbe seen, FL motivation accounted for 15% of the variance in negative attitude toward English [F \n(6,257) = 8.79, p<.001, Adj. ]. Amotivation (!=.28, t=4.77, p<.001), Introjected (!=.13, \nt=2.21, p<.05), and Knowledge (!= -.15 t= -2.35, p<.05) were the three significant predictors of \nthe negative attitude toward English, with Amotivation as the most significant predictor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* Significant at .05 level, ** significant at .01 level\nAmong the two intrinsic motivation subscales, Accomplishment was negatively and \nsignificantly related to Fear of negative evaluation and Comfortableness.

Regression Analyses\nIn order to answer the second question, i.e., which types of motivation predict the \nstudents’ foreign language anxiety in Iranian EFL context, multiple regressions were per -\nformed. To fulfill the function, six motivational subscales were regressed onto each of four \nFLCAS subtypes and the total foreign language anxiety to obtain the results presented in \nTable 4. As can be seen, FL motivation accounted for 15% of the variance in negative atti -\ntude toward English [F (6,257) = 8.79, p<.001, Adj. R\n2 = .15]. Amotivation (β=.28, t=4.77, \np<.001), Introjected (β=.13, t=2.21, p<.05), and Knowledge (β= -.15 t= -2.35, p<.05) were \nthe three significant predictors of the negative attitude toward English, with Amotivation as \nthe most significant predictor.\nTable 4. Regression analysis for foreign language classroom anxiety. \n* Significant at .05 level, ** significant at .01 level, *** significant at .001 level\nFor Communication fear, FL motivation accounted 14% of the variance [F (6,257) = \n8.30, p<.001, Adj. R 2 = .14]. Amotivation (β=.22, t=3.79, p<.001) and Introjected (β=.25, \nt=4.05, p<.001) were the two significant predictors of the Communication fear, with Intro -\njected as the most significant predictor.\nForeign language motivation also accounted for 22% of the variance in fear of negative \nevaluation [F (6,257) = 13.59, p<.001, Adj. R 2 = .22]. Amotivation (β=.30, t=5.34, p<.001), \nIntrojected (β=.23, t=3.95, p<.001), and Accomplishment (β= -.12, t=-2.07, p<.05) were the \nthree significant predictors of the fear of negative evaluation, with Amotivation as the most \nsignificant. \nFurthermore, FL motivation accounted for 14% of the variance in comfortableness with \nEnglish class [F (6,257) = 8.32, p<.001, Adj. R\n2 = .14]. Amotivation (β=.17, t=2.90, p<.01), \nIdentified (β= -.23, t= -3.64, p<.001), and Knowledge (β= -.15, t= -2.31, p<.05) were the \nPo r t a Li n g u a r u m Nº 20, junio 2013\n278\nthree significant predictors of the comfortableness with English class, with Identified as the \nmost significant predictor. And finally, FL motivation accounted for 20% of the variance in \ntotal foreign language anxiety [F (6,257) = 12.31, p<.001, Adj. R\n2 = .20]. Amotivation (β=.28, \nt=4.97, p<.001) and introjected (β=.23, t=3.87, p<.001) were its two significant predictors \nwith amotivation as the most significant one. \n3.4. Structural Equation Modeling\nBased on the previous research and review of the literature, a model of three latent \nvariables (FLFL anxiety, FL motivation, and FL achievement) was constructed. Foreign lan -\nguage motivation was speculated to be related to FL anxiety. It is based on the assumption \nthat the more self-determined the students are, the less anxiety they feel (Noels et. al, 2000; \nPapi, 2010). Therefore, a direct path from FL motivation to FL anxiety was hypothesized. It \nwas also expected that FL motivation and anxiety were closely related to FLFL achievement \n(Noels et. al, 2000). Following this, paths from FL motivation and anxiety to FL achievement \nwere added. The interrelationships among variables are shown in Fig.1.\nANXIETY AND MOTIVATION IN EFL ACHIEVEMENT 10 \n!\n \nFigure1.

SEM results for the final model.\n4. dIs c u s sIo n \nThe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between FL motivation \nand anxiety and to investigate the simultaneous effect of FL motivation and anxiety on \nFL achievement. The results indicated that various types of FL motivation are significantly \ncorrelated to FL anxiety subscales. In other words, students who have different reasons for \nlearning English are different in their level and type of anxiety. The difference becomes most \nnotable when students who had no motivation are compared to those who were motivated \n(intrinsic or extrinsic). As can be seen in Table 3, Amotivation was positively and signifi-\ncantly correlated to all four subscales of FL anxiety. Thus, students who lacked motivation \nto learn English, all had English communication fear, fear of negative evaluation, negative \nattitude toward English class, and were not comfortable in their classes.  \nThe relations between subscales of FL anxiety and intrinsic/extrinsic motivation were \nalso interesting. Of the three subscales of extrinsic motivation, external and introjected \nregulations were positively correlated to all FL anxiety subscales except comfortableness \nwith English class. Therefore, students who learnt English to gain some benefits or to avoid \npunishment all had English communication fear, fear of negative evaluation, and negative \nattitude toward English class. However, the most self-determined type of extrinsic motiva -\ntion, identified regulation, was negatively correlated to two subscales of FL anxiety, negative \nattitude toward English class and comfortableness with English class. Therefore, among \nthe three extrinsic motivation subscales, students who learn English for personally relevant \nreasons to achieve a valued goal feel less anxiety comparing with those who learn English \nfor some type of internal or external pressure. \nANXIETY AND MOTIVATION IN EFL ACHIEVEMENT 11 \n!\nfor large sample size, ( !2/df) was used, with a value below 3 considered as acceptable (Byr ne, \n2001).

FL learners who were intrinsically motivated to achieve a goal \ndid not have a negative attitude toward English class and felt comfortable with it. Also, \nFL learners who were intrinsically motivated to develop knowledge did not have English \ncommunication fear, negative attitude toward English class, and were comfortable with their \nEnglish class. These results are consistent with the past research in that greater anxiety in \nthe English class was associated with amotivation, and lower levels of identified regulation \nand intrinsic motivation (e.g., Noels, Clément & Pelletier, 1999; Tremblay & Gardner, 1995). \nLanguage learners who have no motivation to study English and those who study English \nfor external reasons (except identified regulation) feel more anxious than those students who \nlearn English for intrinsic reasons. \nRegression analyses used to check the predictability of the FL anxiety by FL motivation \nindicated that Amotivation and introjected regulation were the two significant predictors \nof the total FL anxiety. So, students who have no reason to study English and those who \nlearn English due to some kind of internal pressure, feel the greatest anxiety in the En -\nglish class. What is notable here is that among the less self-determined types of external \nmotivation, Introjected regulation and External regulation, only Introjected regulation was a \npredictor of total FL anxiety. It means students who learn English to avoid the guilt or for \nego-enhancement (internal pressure) are more anxious than those who learn English to gain \nsome tangible benefits (external source).\nStructural equation modeling was also used to explore the simultaneous effect of FL \nmotivation and anxiety on FL achievement. The results of SEM indicated adequate fit to \nthe data, confirming the interrelationships among FL motivation, anxiety, and achievement. \nMotivation specified as an exogenous variable, had six composite indicator variables. Among \nthese six variables, Accomplishment (regression coefficient= .68) and Knowledge (regression \ncoefficient=.62) had the highest loadings on FL motivation. It shows that language learners’ \nmotivation is highly affected by their sensations for achieving a goal and their desire to \nexplore new ideas and knowledge. As seen in Figure 2, regression coefficient for the path \nfrom FL motivation to achievement was .82, indicating that FL motivation is the most signi -\nficant predictor of achievement. Motivation also had an indirect influence on FL achievement \nthrough anxiety (i.e. -.35 × -.26 = .09). It suggests that motivated students feel less anxiety, \nand subsequently are more proficient in English. As expected, FL motivation had a negative \neffect on anxiety (regression coefficient=-.35). This significant negative path from motivation \nto anxiety suggests that motivated students feel less anxious in the classroom.\nThe direct path from anxiety to FL achievement was negatively significant (regression \ncoefficient= -.26). Therefore, language learners who fear to communicate in English and \nare afraid of negative evaluation have a negative attitude toward English class, do not feel \ncomfortable with English class and are less proficient in English. \nThere are a number of implications in the findings of this study that language teachers \nand researchers should be aware of. First, motivation is negatively and significantly related \nto anxiety, showing that by increasing students’ motivation their anxiety decreases. There -\nfore, language teachers should motivate their students in order to decrease their anxiety in \nthe English class. However, as the results showed, only intrinsic motivation and identified \nregulation (the most self-determined type of extrinsic motivation) were negatively related \nto anxiety. As the second implication of the study, it indicates that motivating the language \nPo r t a Li n g u a r u m Nº 20, junio 2013\n282\nlearners by only more self-determined types of motivation can decrease anxiety. Although \nextrinsic motivation can lead to intrinsic motivation under certain circumstances, teachers \nshould use techniques that foster students’ intrinsic motivation. As Dörnyei (1994) pointed \nout teachers should introduce tasks that stimulate intrinsic motivation and help students to \ninternalize it\n. For this purpose,  interesting, stimulating, and challenging tasks should be \nused in FL classes. \nAnxiety was negatively related to language achievement. It, therefore, offers the third \nimplication that in order to improve students’ English achievement, it is necessary for both \nlanguage teachers and learners to take action to decrease FL anxiety level. Teachers can de -\ncrease language learners’ anxiety by creating a supportive and relaxing learning environment, \nproviding training in learning strategies, setting goals that are not too easy or too difficult, \nand using anxiety-reducing techniques (Dörnyei, 1994). \nFinally, the present study was conducted in a private language institute. Further research \ncan extend the scope and examine its findings in formal settings such as EFL universities \nand schools which are usually more anxiety provoking places than institutes. The proficien -\ncy level of EFL learners can also be controlled to find out whether certain levels are more \nanxiety provoking than others. And finally the gender and age of participants were not \ncontrolled in this study. So, by taking account of these two important variables, the future \nstudy can shed more light on the relationships among motivation, anxiety and achievement \nin foreign language learning. \n5. re f e r e n c e s\nByrne, B.
