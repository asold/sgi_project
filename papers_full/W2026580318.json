Fault Detection Principles\nThe impedance Z of the transformer is a combined value mainly\nof the winding components (resistances, leakage reactances and ca-\npacitances) and the excitation c omponents (conductance, suscep-\ntance and capacitance). The inductive ( L) and capacitive (C)c o m -\nponents are responsible for the tran sient and resonance, which oc-\ncurs at a given frequency when the inductive reactance balances\nthe capacitive reactance. The resonant frequency fr is generally ex-\npressed by the Eq. (1).\nfr = 1\n2π\n√\nLC\n········································· (1)\n2. Test Circuits\nThere are two ways of frequendy response analysis (FRA) mea-\nsurement: one with the LV side of t he transformer open-circuited,\nand the other with the LV side of tra nsformer short-circuited. Dur-\ning an open-circuit test, the e xcitation components dominate the\ncircuit. The other, during a shor t-circuit test, the phenomenon is\nreversed, the excitation components become negligible compared to\nthe short-circuited winding resistance and leakage reactance.\n[Case Study 1] Diagnosis on Lead Wire Breaks in\nElectrostatic Shields (Short-Circuit Test) An investiga-\ntion was made on the assumption that the earth lead wire to the\nelectrostatic shield was broken. Fig. 1 shows the FRA measure-\nment results in case the disconnection of the lead wire of W phase\nonly was simulated while the lead wires of U phase and V phase\nwere connected. As a result, we could recognize the following: (1)\nThe ﬁrst resonant frequency of W phase is higher by approximately\n26% than those of the other two phases. (2) The impedance of W\nphase at the ﬁrst resonant frequenc y is higher than the impedance\nof the other two phases. (3) Di ﬀerences in the characteristics of\nimpedance are more signiﬁcant at high frequencies than those at the\nﬁrst resonant frequency. (4) The ch aracteristics of the impedance\nin a frequency range of 3 kHz or below are same for the three\nphases. From EMTP simulation with a lumped parameter model of\nthe transformer-windings in cases both with and without lead wire\nconnection, we could ﬁnd similar features in the actual FRA mea-\nsurement and the simulation results.\n[Case Study 2] Diagnosis of Double Core Earths\n(Open-Circuit Test) An investigation was made by compar-\ning the case of normal core earth and the case of simulated dou-\nble core earths. As a typical example of FRA measurement results,\nFig. 2 shows the comparison of FRA waveforms from the HV side\n(U phase). The above comparison shows that di ﬀerences in fre-\nquency response characteristics between normal core earth and dou-\nble core earths are apparent in a lower frequency range. In addition,\nthe frequency response characteris tics were discovered to be such\nthat the ﬁrst resonance frequency was higher in the case of double\ncore earths than normal core earth, and the impedance of the former\nis smaller than the latter. The reason for the above seems to be that\nFig. 1. FRA measurement result in the case study 1\nFig. 2. FRA measurement result in the case study 2\nthe core was partially short-circuited owing to double earths, which\nlowered excitation susceptance and resulted infr increase according\nto the Eq. (1).\n3. Conclusion\nIt could be seen that the lead wire broken in electrostatic shields\nand double core earths change frequency response characteristics\nrespectively. These ﬁndings suggest the possibility of transformer\ndiagnosis from outside by FRA measurements. It was conﬁrmed\nthat the location of damaged part could be estimated if examinations\nwere performed by comparing the frequency response characteris-\ntics of three phases and by comparing between measurement and\nsimulation characteristics.\nFor transformers evaluated as abnormal by DGA (Dissolved Gas\nAnalysis) etc., the abnormal locations can be speciﬁed by FRA di-\nagnosis before causing serious failures, and the transformer can be\nperformed premeditated repair.\n–3–\nPaper\nExperimental Investigation on FRA Diagnosis of Transformer Faults\nTakahiro Sano\n∗\nMember\nKatsunori Miyagi\n∗∗\nSenior Member\nThe need for economical, reliable and e ﬀective delivery of electric power leads to the search for new, e ﬃcient and\neﬀective methods for diagnosing the high voltage equipments in the industries all over the world.

Introduction\nPower transformers being expensive items need to be care-\nfully monitored throughout its operation. Currently, condi-\ntion based maintenance and online monitoring are gaining\nimportance. Frequency response analysis (FRA) has been\nfound to be adequate for the evaluation of possible deforma-\ntions or displacements of the transformer windings as tech-\nnique to diagnose from the transformer outside\n(1)–(5). While\nguidelines for the method of transformer diagnostic testing\nby FRA measurements are under consideration by CIGRE\n(SC A2) WG\n(6), FRA measurement methods are yet to be\nﬁrmly established.\nIn this paper, experiments were conducted on aged power\ntransformers as test objects with simulated-faults. For exam-\nple, the FRA measurements were able to be carried out with\nand without test bushings. Furthermore, the FRA character-\nistics about the cases of unusual core earth connection and\nthe lead wire breaks in electrostatic shields were able to be\nobtained. It was found from the results of these experiments\nthat the comparison of frequency response characteristics for\nindividual phases was e ﬀective as diagnosis of transformers\nby FRA. The comparison to simulations suggested the pos-\nsibility of pinpointing the fault parts by the FRA measure-\nments. Therefore, it was discussed to be possible to prevent\nthe serious failures by FRA diagnosis for fault locations in\ntransformers. Furthermore, comparisons were carried out be-\ntween measured and simulated FRA results.\n2. Principles and Measurement Example\n2.1 Fault Detection Principles The impedance Z of\nthe transformer is a combined value mainly of the winding\n∗Transformer Division, Japan AE Power Systems Corporation\n585, Shimonakamizo Higashi Makado, Numazu 410-0865\n∗∗R & D Division, Japan AE Power Systems Corporation\n1-1-1, Kokubu-cho, Hitachi 316-8501\ncomponents (resistances, leakage reactances and capaci-\ntances) and the excitation components (conductance, suscep-\ntance and capacitance). The inductive (L) and capacitive (C)\ncomponents are responsible for the transient and resonance,\nwhich occurs at a given frequency when the inductive reac-\ntance balances the capacitive reactance. The resonant fre-\nquency fr is generally expressed by the Eq. (1).\nfr = 1\n2π\n√\nLC\n··································· (1)\nThere are two types of the resonances; parallel and series\nresonance. The parallel resonance is related to the parallel\nconnection of the capacitance and inductance and has high\nimpedance. On the contrary, the series resonance is related\nto the series connection, has very low impedance.\nIn addition, resonances can also occur locally between sec-\ntions and turns of the windings. These resonances can be\naﬀected by changes of L or C that take place locally. FRA,\nwhich performs measurement over a wide frequency range, is\ncapable of detecting many resonance points. Therefore, it is\npossible to estimate the locations of local changes that could\nnot be detected through conventional diagnostic techniques.\n2.2 Test Conditions and Circuits There are two\nmethods of FRA measurement on a two-winding transformer\nfrom the HV side: one with the LV side of the transformer\nin Fig. 1(a) open-circuited, and the other with the LV side of\ntransformer in Fig. 1(b) short-circuited\n(7). During an open-\ncircuit test, the excitation components and winding compo-\nnents are in series, so the excitation components dominate\nthe circuit, and the winding resistance and leakage reactance\nare negligible at low frequency. The other, during a short-\ncircuit test, the phenomenon is reversed, with the opposite\nwinding components in parallel. The excitation components\nbecome negligible compared to the short-circuited winding\nresistance and leakage reactance.\nThe measurement system is shown in Fig. 2. The input\n࿦ Bɼ127ר7ɼ2007 ೥ 791\n(a) Open-circuit test\n(b) Short-circuit test\nCWH,C WL: Inter-section capacitance C H,C L : Capacitance to ground\nCHL : Inter-winding capacitance R H,R L : Winding resistance\nLH,L L : Inductance of windings Re, Le, Ce: Excitation admittance\nFig. 1.

FRA measurement system of a three-phase\ntransformer\nimpedance of the measuring equipment is 1 M ohm, and\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the measurement cables.\nA sinusoidal wave which frequency is swept automatically\nfrom 100 Hz to 1 MHz was applied to the high voltage ter-\nminal, and then the impedance Z of the transformer was cal-\nculated from V/I. Where the sweep resolution was set to\n400 steps/sweep (100 steps/div), and the applied voltage was\nset to 10 Vpeak.\n2.3 FRA Measurement Example (Baseline Measure-\nment) The waveforms by which we attempted to make\nTable 1. Characteristics of measurement cable\nFig. 3. FRA measurement example for the open-circuit\ntest of a normal three-phase transformer (220 kV ,\n120 MV A)\nFig. 4. FRA measurement example for the short-circuit\ntest of a normal three-phase transformer (220 kV ,\n120 MV A)\ncomparison of individual phases with respect to FRA mea-\nsurements on a normal three-phase transformer (220 kV ,\n120 MV A) are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 in the case of open- and\nshort-circuit respectively. The ﬁrst peak frequency (200 Hz\nto 300 Hz) in Fig. 3 (open-circuit test) is lower than the ﬁrst\npeak frequency (approx. 4 kHz) in Fig. 4 (short-circuit test).\nIt can be supposed that compared to the leakage reactances\nof windings, the susceptance of excitation was so great that\nthe frequency was dropped according to the Eq. (1).\nFrom the comparison of frequency response characteris-\ntics in the cases of open- and short- circuit, the following two\ncharacteristics can be recognized:\n( 1 ) In the open-circuit test, over a range of 100 Hz to\n1 kHz, the characteristics of the impedance of V phase are\nshifted to lower frequencies compared to those of the other\nphases (U, W).\n( 2 ) In the short-circuit test, the waveforms of the three\nphases were nearly same.\n792 IEEJ Trans. PE, Vol.127, No.7, 2007\nFRA for Failure Diagnosis of Power Transformer\nFig. 5. The ﬂow of ﬂux in the case of the open-circuit\ntest\nAs shown in Fig. 5, for the core structure, V phase is lo-\ncated in the center of the three-leg core and its magnetic path\nis shorter than the paths of the other phases. As the suscep-\ntance value, expressed as “ L” in the Eq. (1), is proportional\nto the length of a magnetic path, the susceptance value of V\nphase becomes smaller than the values of U and W phases.\nIn consequence, the resonant frequency fr was shifted to the\nlower side as shown in the characteristics described in ( 1 ).\nThe winding structure of each phase was conﬁgured on the\nsame axial symmetry, and the parameter values for the wind-\ning that could aﬀect frequency response characteristics were\nnearly same in the three phases. In addition, they were free\nfrom the inﬂuence of the above-mentioned magnetic circuit.\nIt can be judged that the feature described in ( 2 ) was ob-\ntained.\nAs shown above, even for a normal transformer, the FRA\nwaveforms show the di ﬀerent characteristics because of the\ndiﬀerence in the structures of individual phases in the open-\ncircuit test, unlike the short-circuit test.\n2.4 Inﬂuence of Factors Outside the Transformer\n(Short-Circuit Test) FRA measurements aim to diag-\nnose damage to the transformer from outside by detecting\naf e wd iﬀerences in the waveforms that show frequency re-\nsponse characteristics. Should these di ﬀerences be a ﬀected\nby external condition, fault diagnosis could not be performed\nwith accuracy. The external condition includes, for example,\nmeasurement cables, power cables and bushings.\nTo investigate the inﬂuence of external factors, measure-\nments were made on a normal three-phase power transformer\n(110 kV , 40 MV A) with and without test bushings. FRA mea-\nsurements at the factory test were made assuming the case\nwith test bushings, and FRA measurements at the on-site test\nwere made assuming the case without test bushings. These\nmeasurements were made through the short-circuit test, and\nthe FRA measurement results are shown in Fig. 6. It was\nfound from these results that the resonant frequency was re-\nduced by approximately 7% in the case with test bushings\ncompared to the resonant frequency in the case without test\nbushings.\nFig. 6. FRA measurement result for the short-circuit\ntest of a three-phase transformer (110 kV , 40 MV A)\nFig. 7. Equivalent circuit of two-winding transformer\nwindings for EMTP (single phase model)\nFor EMTP models with a lumped parameter model of the\ntransformer-windings shown in Fig. 7 simulated in cases both\nwith and without test bushings, Fig. 8 shows the results of re-\nspective calculations obtained using the “Frequency Scan”\nfunction of EMTP. From the above, we could ﬁnd similar\nfeatures in the actual FRA measurement and the simulation\nresults.\nSupposedly, these di ﬀerences of the resonant frequency\nwere caused by the capacitance of test bushings added to the\ncapacitance to ground of the transformer, whereby fr was re-\nduced according to the Eq. (1). Table 2 shows the compari-\nson with respect to capacitance to ground of the transformer\nin cases with and without test bushings. In the case with\ntest bushings, from the Eq. (1), fr decreases in proportion to\n1/\n√\nC by approximately 8%. This value is nearly same to\nthe value obtained from the results of the FRA measurement,\n࿦ Bɼ127ר7ɼ2007 ೥ 793\nFig. 8. FRA simulation result for the short-circuit test\nof a three-phase transformer (110 kV , 40 MV A)\nTable 2. Capacitance to ground of the transformer\n(measurement result)\nso the di ﬀerences in the above results are found to be at-\ntributable to the existence of test bushings only. As is\npresented above, because frequency response characteristics\ncould be a ﬀected by the condition outside the transformer,\nmuch precaution is required when performing measurement.\n3. Diagnosing Faults (Case Studies)\n3.1 Case 1: Diagnosis on Lead Wire Breaks in Elec-\ntrostatic Shields (Short-Circuit Test) Transformers, in\nwhich electrostatic shields were installed to prevent over-\nvoltage between HV winding and tap winding when light-\nning surges strike the transformers, have been often man-\nufactured\n(8). It is reported that electrostatic shields may be\ndamaged by aged deterioration (9). Even if a lead wire in an\nelectrostatic shield breaks, the damage will not cause a fail-\nure in the transformer immediately, because it is not the main\nconducting circuits in the transformer. However, if the dam-\nage remains for a long duration, serious failures may occur\nowing to electric discharge and overheating around the lead\nwire in the transformer.\nWe selected a three-phase power transformer (147 kV ,\n150 MV A) as a model for the diagnosis of lead wire breaks in\nelectrostatic shields. This transformer is characterized by the\nelectrostatic shield with ground potential installed between\nHV winding and tap winding.\nHere, an investigation was made on the assumption that the\nearth lead wire to the electrostatic shield was broken shown\nin Fig. 9. Because frequency response characteristics about\nwindings can be diagnosed through the short-circuit test,\ncomparison and investigation of frequency response charac-\nteristics were performed between normal connection of the\nlead wire and simulated disconnection of the lead wire.\nFig. 10 shows the FRA measurement results in case the dis-\nconnection of the lead wire of W phase only was simulated\nwhile the lead wires of U phase and V phase were connected.\nAs a result, we could recognize the following:\nFig. 9. Circuit condition for lead wire breaks model\nFig. 10. FRA measurement result for the short-circuit\ntest of a three-phase transformer (147 kV , 150 MV A)\nFig. 11.

PE, Vol.127, No.7, 2007\nFRA for Failure Diagnosis of Power Transformer\nFig. 12. Experimental core earth points for double core\nearths model\nFig. 13. FRA measurement result for the open-circuit\ntest of a three-phase transformer (230 kV , 150 MV A)\nperfomed in cases with and without lead wire connection. We\nobtained the characteristics similar to those obtained through\nactual measurements.\nIn Fig. 11, resonance points at about 5 kHz which do not\nexist in Fig. 10 are detected. There are many diﬀerent points\nbetween measurement and simulation result including these\nresonance points. However, their causes still can not be eval-\nuated well.\nIf the applicability of the simulation model can be con-\nﬁrmed, it will be possible, for example, to simulate frequency\nresponse characteristics by assuming the damaged part — the\ntest technique that can be used for diagnosis such as identi-\nﬁcation of damaged part through comparison to FRA mea-\nsurement results.\n3.2 Case 2: Diagnosis of Double Core Earths (Open-\nCircuit Test) If the internal structure materials of the\ntransformer including the core are multiple-earthed, local\noverheating can occur owing to circulating currents. Al-\nthough it is rare that this causes a failure, dissolved gas in\noil may be generated by the overheating.\nWe selected a three-phase power transformer (230 kV ,\n150 MV A) to be used in the case study on double core earths.\nFrequency response characteristics about the core can be\ntested through the open-circuit test.\nHere, an investigation was made by comparing the case\nof normal core earth and the case of simulated double core\nearths. The core earth points are shown in Fig. 12. As a\ntypical example of FRA measurement results, Fig. 13 shows\nthe comparison of the FRA waveforms from the HV side (U\nphase). The above comparison shows that di ﬀerences in fre-\nquency response characteristics between normal core earth\nand double core earths are apparent in a lower frequency\nrange (100 Hz to 1 kHz), whereas there are no signiﬁcant dif-\nferences in other frequency range (1 kHz to 1 MHz).\nIn addition, the frequency response characteristics were\ndiscovered to be such that the ﬁrst resonance frequency was\nhigher in the case of double core earths than normal core\nearth, and the impedance of the former is smaller than the\nlatter. The reason for the above seems to be that the core\nwas partially short-circuited owing to double earths, which\nlowered excitation inductance and resulted in fr increase ac-\nc o r d i n gt ot h eE q .( 1 ) .\n4. Conclusion\nIt could be seen that if the lead wire of the electrostatic\nshield was broken, the capacitance between HV winding and\ntap winding changed and caused frequency response charac-\nteristics to change signiﬁcantly. It could also be seen that\nif the transformer core was double-earthed, excitation induc-\ntance changed, causing frequency response characteristics to\nchange accordingly.\nThese ﬁndings suggest the possibility of transformer diag-\nnosis from outside by FRA measurements. In addition, the\ninﬂuence of the conditions outside transformers could also\nbeen recognized over frequency response characteristics, so\nit is necessary to consider their inﬂuence at the time of diag-\nnosis.\nIt was found that the characteristics similar to those of ac-\ntually measured FRA waveforms could be obtained also in\nEMTP simulations of the transformer-windings. Particularly,\nit was conﬁrmed that the location of damaged part could be\nestimated if examinations were performed by comparing the\nfrequency response characteristics of three phases and by\ncomparing between measurement and simulation character-\nistics.\nFor transformers evaluated as abnormal by DGA (Dis-\nsolved Gas Analysis) etc., the abnormal locations can be\nspeciﬁed by FRA diagnosis before causing serious failures,\nand the transformer can be performed premeditated repair. It\nis reported that the transformer can be repaired premeditat-\nedly without stopping power supply because the lead wire\nbreaks of electrostatic shields were conﬁrmed by FRA diag-\nnosis\n(10).\n5. Future Subject\nShould the capacitance or inductance inside the trans-\nformer change partially, changes to frequency response char-\nacteristics could become very small. The overall feature of\nthe frequency response characteristics from these measure-\nments and simulations are in agreement, whereas there can be\nfound many diﬀerences in detailed parts. It will be necessary\n࿦ Bɼ127ר7ɼ2007 ೥ 795\nin the future to establish a simulation technique that can cope\nwith a few changes.\nFRA measurement helps to obtain impedance characteris-\ntics over a range from high to low frequencies with relative\nease. However, there is inﬂuence from the measurement sys-\ntem in a high frequency range, so precaution is required at the\ntime of actual measurement. In the present study, it was con-\nﬁrmed that the di ﬀerences of frequency response character-\nistics became apparent depending on cases with and without\ntest bushings. It will be therefore necessary in the future to\ndetermine other parameters of the measurement system that\nmay aﬀect frequency response characteristics and to establish\na measurement technique for minimizing the inﬂuence from\nthe measurement system.\n(Manuscript received Aug. 25, 2006,\nrevised April 2, 2007)\nReferences\n( 1 ) E.P.
