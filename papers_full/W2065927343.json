Introduction\nDue to an increase of electric power consumption the ca-\npacity of an electric power system is growing. To fulﬁll\nthe power demand, large capacity power transformers have\nbeen used in high voltage power transmission systems es-\npecially above 200 kV . As the transformers have small leak-\nage impedance, when a fault occurs in the power system, the\ntransformer limited fault (TLF) current became to exceed an\ninterrupting current of the T10 test condition relevant to the\nIEC standard. After current interrupting occurs by a circuit\nbreaker (CB) due to the power system fault, CB is needed to\nendure a transient recovery voltage (TRV) to keep an elec-\ntricity distribution and operations of the power system. Since\na fault current of the TLF condition becomes to exceed the\nT10 condition, a separate test has been adopted with a current\nlevel higher than that at T10. The TRV should be investigated\ncarefually at the TLF condition so that a circuit breaker is not\ntested under unnecessarily severe conditions.\nAlthough there were several researches to investigate\nTRVs at the TLF condition\n(1) (2), the most case used the values\nof a leakage inductance of 50 /60 Hz and a stray capacitance\nto analyze TRVs by using Electromagnetic Transient Pro-\ngram (EMTP). A phenomenon has been known about mag-\nnetic ﬂux which will not be able to enter an iron core of a\ntransformer winding at high frequency regions. Therefore\n∗Kyushu Institute of Technology\n1-1, Sensuicho, Tobata-ku, Kita-kyushu 804-8550\n∗∗Chuo University\n13-27, Kasuga-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8551\n∗∗∗Toshiba Corporation\n2-1, Ukichimacho, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0862\nthe leakage inductance will change along with the frequency.\nA leakage inductance of 50 /60 Hz may give wrong TRV . A\ntransformer consists of very complex components compos-\ning a network of resistances, capacitances and self or mutual\ninductances.\nFor the purpose of calculating TRVs accurately at TLF\nconditions, with equivalent circuit elements at the TRV fre-\nquency range around 10 ∼100 kHz, the ﬁrst step research\nstudy with two windings low voltage transformer model was\nconducted.\nIn this report, the consideration and calculation for wind-\ning resistances, leakage inductances and stray capacitances of\na test transformer are presented to obtain an accurate trans-\nformer model.\n2. Transformer Limited Fault\nThe TLF is one of fault that occurs in an electric power\nsystem. The fault clearing case in an actual power system is\nshown in Figs. 1(a) and (b). The TLF interrupting is deﬁned\nas a fault where all fault currents are supplied through a trans-\nformer. Figure 1(b) represents the equivalent circuit diagram\nof the TLF interrupting condition in an electric power sys-\ntem. In the case of a TRV related to the TLF current interrupt-\ning condition, while short-circuit currents are generally much\nsmaller than the rated short-circuited current but it is certain\nthat a severe TRV may result because of low impedances\nmainly due to the transformer stray capacitance\n(3) (4).T h e\ntransformer stray capacitance occurs from winding to wind-\ning, from turn to turn, from windings to core and from wind-\ning to ground. The capacitance from winding to ground is\nthe most dominant parameter on TRV than the other trans-\nformer capacitances. During the TLF the majority of the\nc⃝2009 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. 1174\nTransformer Model for TRV Calculation by EMTP\n(a) Equivalent circuit for TLF clearing\n(b) TLF interrupting in power system\nFig. 1. TLF interrupting circuit diagram\nvoltage shares by the transformer impedance X Tr,s ot h a t\nTRV after the fault current interrupting is mostly generated\nby the relevant transformer constants (5). To construct EMTP\ntransformer model it was needed to know the test transformer\nimpedance.\n3. Impedance Measurement\n3.1 FRA Measurement The frequency response\nanalysis (FRA) is a powerful diagnostic technique and be-\ncame popular for an examination of a transformer internal\nconditions\n(6). It can measure the impedance of transformer\nwindings over a wide range of frequencies. This property\nwas used well in our research by converting the FRA mea-\nsurement raw data to impedances in ohm values versus fre-\nquency. The transformer impedance was measured by a fre-\nquency response analyzer (NF FRA 5059), the measurable\nfrequency range of which is between 0.1 mHz to 2.2 MHz.\nThe schematic diagram of transformer winding impedance\nmeasurement is expressed in Fig. 2.\nThe FRA measurement was done from both sides of the\ntest transformer. The FRA measurement from the secondary\nwinding while the primary winding is short-circuited did not\ngive the resonance point up to 2.2 MHz. The measurement at\nthe primary winding while the secondary is short-circuited\ngave the complete result shown in Fig. 3(a). Which was\nused to calculate the transformer impedance and then re-\nsults were converted to the secondary side values by the test\ntransformer’s turn ratio. The measured impedance near\nthe resonance frequency region is shown in Fig. 3(b) and\nthe measured impedance below 10 Hz is shown in Fig. 3(c)\nrespectively.\n3.2 Impedance Calculation Actually it is better if a\nfrequency dependent inductance model can be used in TRV\ninvestigation. At the moment there is no EMTP inductance\nmodel of frequency dependent. For the ﬁrst step of our study,\nthe leakage inductance (Lt) was evaluated by averaging the\nimpedance values between 500 Hz to 100 kHz. The stray ca-\npacitance (Ct) was calculated from a resonance point of the\nFRA graph (at 0.27 MHz) with applying the calculated leak-\nage inductance value. The ﬁrst EMTP transformer model of\nthe tested 4 kV A two windings low voltage transformer was\nmodeled by these values. Fig. 4 is the equivalent transformer\nFig. 2.

In Fig. 4, Lt is the leakage inductance and Ct is the stray\ncapacitance of the tested transformer. The stray capacitance\nCt is assumed to include all stray capacitance related to the\nTRV . R was adopted for a damping resistance in the TRV os-\ncillation and it was a ﬁtting parameter. In the ﬁrst step EMTP\ntransformer model the damping resistance value was justiﬁed\nto get the same EMTP simulation TRV result with the exper-\niment result\n(5) (7).\n3.3 Precise Calculation Analysis To get an accurate\nimpedance value of the transformer, the following calcula-\ntion was performed. This calculation is based on calculated\n࿦ Bɼ129ר10ɼ2009 ೥ 1175\nFig. 4. First step model transformer circuit of EMTP\nsimulation\nFig. 5.

The right portion includes the capacitance ef-\nfect since 1 /jωCt becomes equivalent to jωLt at the high\nfrequency range. The inductance value which was calcu-\nlated from FRA graph sudden changes at around 0.1 kHz and\n100 kHz in Fig. 6. This phenomenon cannot be understood at\nthe moment. The impedance values calculated from the FRA\ngraph and calculated from Eq. (1) are expressed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Summarized values\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7. Ideal transformer winding circuits\nCt∗ was calculated from the resonance point with Lt∗.T h e\ndiﬀerence is so small as the simulation by EMTP with Lt∗\nand Ct∗values gave the same results with those of Lt and Ct.\nFinding the way to calculate the damping resistance value\nis essential in the next step of EMTP model. To obtain the\naccurate model of the tested transformer, the ideal equivalent\nmodels are considered as in Figs. 7(a) and (b). Fig. 7(b) is\nconsidered as there will be some parallel resistance with the\nstray capacitance due to a skin eﬀect of windings and an iron\nloss at a high frequency region. Rt is the winding resistance\nat very low frequency region and it was obtained from FRA\nmeasurement of Fig. 3(c).\nEMTP simulation was done with both considered models\nFigs. 7(a) and (b). Simulation results of Fig. 7(a) gave the\nagreeable results with the experiment. The simulation result\nof Fig. 7(b) showed a very short decay of vibration compares\nwith the experiment.\nIt is necessary to ﬁnd the damping resistor value used\nin this model instead of a ﬁtting value. According to the\nFRA graph of Fig. 3(a), the transformer winding impedance\nis varying with depending on the frequency. At the resonance\npoint (0.27 MHz) the impedance value will be same as R in\nFig. 7(a) because of jωLt\n∗ =1/jωCt∗when Rt is negligibly\nsmall.

Converting to secondary side value ac-\ncording to turn ratio of the test transformer, R becomes 4.5Ω.\nThis value is agreeable with 5 Ωthat was used in ﬁrst step\nEMTP model of Fig. 4.\n4. Experiment\n4.1 Transformer for Experiment 4 kV A two wind-\nings low voltage transformer was used for our study because\nof its simpleness of winding conﬁguration. Transformer\nspeciﬁcation are expressed in Table 2.\n4.2 Current Injection Measurement The TRV can\nbe investigated by both current interrupting and current injec-\ntion (CIJ) methods. The former one includes various factors\naﬀecting on a TRV shape such as current chopping and the\narcing voltage of interrupting equipments (3) (8). To investigate\nTRV the latter is preferable. The current interrupting can be\nexpressed by a phenomenon where the opposite polarity cur-\nrent is injected after the current zero point. The opposite cur-\nrent is only injected at the current injection method which is\ntheoretically same as the current interrupting.\nTo investigate TRV at TLF current interrupting condition\nwe used CIJ measurement circuit that was expressed in Fig. 8.\nAs expressed in Fig. 1, the power source G supplies the fault\ncurrent through the source side impedance and the trans-\nformer. The circuit breaker CB interrupts the fault current.\nBy this phenomena the experiment circuit was constructed.\nThe power source G was short-circuited, L3 (1.87 mH)\na n dR 3( 0 . 7Ω) represented as source side impedance in the\nTable 2.

Wave shapes of experiment\n࿦ Bɼ129ר10ɼ2009 ೥ 1177\nFig. 1(b). The fault was replaced by a current supply cir-\ncuit. The current supply circuit was energized by DC sup-\nply. Firstly, the capacitor C (42.7μF) was charged by the DC\nvoltage supply by swiching the SW1. After charging the ca-\npacitor C, current injection was done with the SW2 (mercury\nswitch). The values L1 (7.95 mH), L2 (30 μH), R (40 Ω)a n d\nR1 (1.3 Ω) are current injection circuit elements. The volt-\nages at transformer primary and secondary sides were mea-\nsured by an oscilloscope. The wave shapes of two voltages\nare same while the magnitude are di ﬀerent due to the turn\nratio of the transformer. Experiment results of the time dura-\ntions 40 ms (main voltage oscillation) and 100 /400 μs( T R V\noscillation wave) are shown in Figs. 9(a), (b)-1 and (b)-2. The\nTRV oscillation appears at the starting 400 μso ft h em a i n\nvoltage oscillation.\n5. EMTP Model\nThe EMTP simulation model circuit for the TRV investi-\ngation at TLF current interrupting condition was constructed\nand expressed in Fig. 10 (9). Rt is the winding resistance of\nthe test transformer in a very low frequency region Fig. 3(c).\nThe circuit constants are mentioned in Table 3. The sim-\nulation results of EMTP model circuit gave the agreeable\nresults with the experiment. The EMTP results are men-\ntioned in Figs. 11(a) and (b)-1 and (b)-2. Fig. 11(a) is the\nmain voltage oscillation which corresponds to the frequency\nthat gives the closed circuit by the capacitor C, the induc-\ntances L1 +L2, short-circuit impedance L3 and the trans-\nformer leakage impedance Lt*. Fig. 11(b) is the TRV oscil-\nlation which corresponds to the TRV determined by Lt*, L3\nand the transformer stray capacitance Ct* of EMTP simula-\ntion with damping resistance R.\nTo get the agreeable EMTP result in TRV wave shape with\nthe experiment, the damping resistor R is essential in EMTP\nmodel circuit Fig. 10. The EMTP simulation result for TRV\nwithout damping resistance value is expressed in Fig. 11(c).\nFig. 10. Accurate EMTP model\nTable 3.

Discussion\nLet us discuss the results of the experiment and EMTP sim-\nulation results:-\nFrom the main voltage oscillation, Figs. 9(a) and 11(a), it is\n1178 IEEJ Trans. PE, Vol.129, No.10, 2009\nTransformer Model for TRV Calculation by EMTP\nobvious that good agreeable results with the experiment and\nthe simulation. From the EMTP simulation it was understood\nthat the inductance and the capacitance of current supply cir-\ncuit mainly inﬂuenced on the main voltage oscillation wave.\nFrom the TRV oscillation wave, Figs. 9(b) and 11(b),\nagreeable results are seen between the experiment and the\nsimulation. From EMTP simulation it was understood that\nthe leakage inductance and the stray capacitance of the test\ntransformer mainly inﬂuenced on this TRV oscillation wave.\nFurthermore, the damping resistor is indispensable in the\nEMTP model. Its resistance value determines the TRV os-\ncillation to be damped.\n7.
