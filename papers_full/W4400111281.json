  "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of contemporary education, the evolution of teaching strategies such as blended learning and flipped classrooms has highlighted the need for efficient and effective generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this, we introduce MCQGen, a novel generative artificial intelligence framework designed for the automated creation of MCQs. MCQGen uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering techniques, drawing from an extensive external knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the ability of the LLM to produce educationally relevant questions that align with both the goals of educators and the diverse learning needs of students. The framework employs innovative prompt engineering, combining chain-of-thought and self-refine prompting techniques, to enhance the performance of the LLM. This process leads to the generation of questions that are not only contextually relevant and challenging but also reflective of common student misconceptions, contributing effectively to personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement and understanding. Our extensive evaluations showcase the effectiveness of MCQGen in producing high-quality MCQs for various educational needs and learning styles. The framework demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for MCQ creation, marking its practical utility in modern education. In essence, MCQGen offers an innovative and robust solution for the automated generation of MCQs, enhancing personalized learning in the digital era.",
