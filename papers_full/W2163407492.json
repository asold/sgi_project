    "abstract": "We consider using online language models for translating multiple streams which naturally arise on the Web. After establishing that using just one stream can degrade translations on different domains, we present a series of simple approaches which tackle the problem of maintaining translation performance on all streams in small space. By exploiting the differing throughputs of each stream and how the decoder translates prior test points from each stream, we show how translation performance can equal specialised, per-stream language models, but do this in a single language model using far less space. Our results hold even when adding three billion tokens of additional text as a background language model. 1",
