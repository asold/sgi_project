    "abstract": "Generative AI applications have played an increasingly significant role in real-time tracking applications in many domains including, for example, healthcare, consultancy, dialog boxes (common types of window in a graphical user interface of operating systems), monitoring systems, and emergency response. This paper considers generative AI and presents an approach which combines hedge algebra and a multilingual large language model to find hidden rules in big data for ChatGPT. We present a novel method for extracting natural language knowledge from large datasets by leveraging fuzzy sets and hedge algebra to extract these rules, presented in meta data for ChatGPT and generative AI applications. The proposed model has been developed to minimize the computational and staff costs for medium-sized enterprises which are typically resource and time limited. The proposed model has been designed to automate question–response interactions for rules extracted from large data in a multiplicity of domains. The experimental results show that the proposed model performs well using datasets associated with specific domains in healthcare to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The ChatGPT application in case studies of healthcare is tested using datasets for English and Vietnamese languages. In comparative experimental testing, the proposed model outperformed the state of the art, achieving in the range of 96.70–97.50% performance using a heart dataset.",
