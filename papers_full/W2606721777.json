The article presents the results of computer simulation of \ntemperature field of transformer filled with mineral oil and alternatives \ninsulating liquids which include synthetic and natural esters. The analysis \nwas based on the results of computer simulation of temperature field of 10 \nMVA distribution transformer, using the program COMSOL Multiphysics. \n1 Introduction \nMineral oil is one of the most commonly used insulating liquid [1]. It is used in many \nelectrical equipment, such as power transformers. The universality of application of mineral \noil results from its many positive qualities and its very good recognition over the years. \nHowever, at the end of XX century, people began to use alternative insulating liquids. \nRestrictive requirements for safety of electrical power equipment and environmental \nprotection were the main reason of the use of the alternative liquids. \nIn the late XIX century, the idea of the use of alternative liquids in the electrical power \ndevices was founded. At that time vegetable oils, which now are called natural esters, were \nused as an insulating liquid in transformers. \nLong term of the use of mineral oils in electrical power equipment caused the improve of \nthem production and treatment. Satisfied identification of their properties is main reason of \ntheir application as insulating liquids in power industry. Improving manufacturing processes \nand treatment of mineral oils have contributed to a significant reduction of their prices, which \nis one of the important criteria taken into consideration by potential users of transformers. \nFurthermore, affordable price means that mineral oils are still the most commonly used \ninsulation liquids, even if alternative liquids are characterized by significantly better \nenvironmental and fire properties. \nCurrently, natural and synthetic esters are considered as alternatives to mineral oil [2-7]. \nThese liquids have a number of features that are recognized for their benefits, comparing to \nmineral oil. These characteristics are primarily ecological properties such as biodegradability \nand non-toxicity, and properties conditioning operational safety which include high flash and \nfire point and low calorific value [2, 8, 9]. For this reason, when fire safety and environment \nprotection play a key role, the use of transformers filled esters is justified solution. \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author: zbigniew.nadolny@put.poznan.pl \n      \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/477, 010 (2017) 71401053\n2016\n14 E3S Web of Conferences e3sconf/201\nEnergy and Fuels \n53 \n © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Furthermore, companies engaged in the insuring network assets, including \npower transformers, are becoming increasingly aware of the fire risk associated with the use \nof electrical equipment insulating liquid characterized by low values of fire and flash point, \nwhich speaks in favour of esters. \nOn the basis of information presented above, it can be concluded that the esters, unlike \nmineral oil, are characterized by several positive environmental and fire properties, so that \nmore and more willing they are used in electrical equipment, including transformers. One of \nthe basic functions of insulating liquid is heat transport, that is generated mainly by the \nwinding and the core [2, 10-13]. Cooling effectiveness of transformer depends on properties \nof used liquid, because the liquid fills significant space of the transformers [14-16]. \nTherefore, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the temperature field of 10 MVA \ntransformers filled with mineral oil and esters (synthetic and natural). \n2 Research object \nFigure 1 shows the scheme of 10 MVA distribution transformer, which was used in computer \nsimulation of temperature field. \n \nFig. 1. 10 MVA distribution transformer model. \nThe transformer used ON-AN cooling type - active parts of the transformer: oil-cooled \n(natural flow), and the tank: air-cooled (natural convection and radiation). Furthermore, the \ntransformer has a 11-step adjustment of the upper voltage winding in the range of +/-16% of \nthe rated voltage. Cooling system of the transformer is aided by ten B-520FL radiators, of \nwhich the manufacture deep-drawn sheet metal were used. Each of the radiators is equipped \nwith four ribs with a height of 1.4 m and eleven ribs with a height of 1.6 m. Simplified \nconstruction and the small number of radiators in the presented transformer helped to \nsignificantly reduce the time of computer simulation. \n      \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/477, 010 (2017) 71401053\n2016\n14 E3S Web of Conferences e3sconf/201\nEnergy and Fuels \n53 \n2\n3 Computational model \nThe analysis temperature field distribution can be made using following models: analytical \nmodels, numerical models, and real models. The paper presents the results of analysis of \nnumerical models. Computational model was created (fig. 2) on the basis of object presented \nin chapter 2, which was a 10 MVA distribution transformer, using COMSOL Multiphysics \nsoftware. The geometry of the model was simplified because the real object has a number of \nstructural elements (e.g. conservator, bushings, control cabinet), which do not affect its \nthermal efficiency [17]. Table 1 shows main parameters of used model. \n \nFig. 2. 10 MVA distribution transformer computational model. \nTable 1. Main parameters of the 10 MVA distribution transformer model. \nRated power 10 MVA \nRated voltages  HV: 115 kV, LV: 16,5 kV \nRated currents HV: 50 A, LV: 350 A \nTypes of cooling ON-AN \nNumber of phase 3 \nVector group symbol Ynd11 \nNo-load current 0.12% \nTotal weight 23 800 kg \nMass of insulating oil 6 400 kg \nNo-load losses 6 600 W \nLoad losses 57 400 W \nPresented in figure 2 computational model consists of tank, lower and upper voltage \nwinding, regulating winding and radiators. Therefore, the transformer design is symmetrical \nand has a symmetrical spacing of radiators along the axis. So, it was decided to modelling \nonly a quarter of the transformer. Authors resigned from the modelling stamping ribs \nradiators. Mesh model was built with tetragonal and pyramidal elements, whose number does \nnot exceed 13 million. It allowed to achieve appropriate accuracy of the obtained results, \nwhich was 0.01%, and significantly reduce simulation time. \nDuring computer simulation of insulating liquids, material parameters corresponding to \nthe mineral oil, natural and synthetic esters were adopted. This means that in the case of \nmineral oil the value of heat transfer factor  equal to 125.70 W·m-2·K-1, natural ester 111.80 \nW·m-2·K-1, and synthetic ester 110.72 W·m-2·K-1 was accepted.  \n      \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/477, 010 (2017) 71401053\n2016\n14 E3S Web of Conferences e3sconf/201\nEnergy and Fuels \n53 \n3\nHeat transfer factor  is the key parameter, which describes the ability of liquid to transfer \nof the heat. The factor  considers many thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, \nspecific heat, viscosity, density and kinematic extension factor. All mentioned parameters \nhave significant influence on heat transfer by the liquids.  \nThe boundary conditions were used in the last step of the calculation. It means that \nambient temperature and heat transfer factor α are known. It was assumed that the losses in \nthe core and windings are heat sources. The values of these losses were determined in the \nresult of the short-circuit attempt on presented research model, and then implemented in \nanalysed computational model. The value of the losses was 64 kW. Moreover, according to \nthe standard [18] it has been adopted that the ambient temperature is 20 C, and atmospheric \npressure is 1 atm. \nIn order to determine the distribution of temperature field in the transformer in COMSOL \nMultiphysics, Heat Transfer module was used. The module considers thermal properties of \nanalysed liquids and type of flow. This module considers temperature dependence of thermal \nproperties such as thermal conductivity, viscosity, density and specific heat, which determine \nthe heat transfer in liquids. Therefore, authors have presented the results of research on the \nthermal properties of the insulating liquids in previous publications, presented research \nresults were used in the simulations [19-22]. \nIn order to receive the dependence of time, simulations were conducted in non-stationary \nmode. Steady state was reached after about 14 hours for all analysed cases. During the heating \ntrials carried out on the presented research model after about 10 hours steady state was \nreached. The differences in the two times result from two reasons. First one is related to the \nfact that in the case of the real object, in order to faster obtaining steady state under heating \ntest voltage is initially greater than rated voltage, thereby shortening the duration of the test. \nOn the other hand, in the case of the computer simulation, the use of the function \ncorresponding to a gradual increase in power windings and core leads to lengthening its \nduration. \n4 Simulation results \nOn the basis of presented research, object and computational model simulations of the \ndistribution of temperature field in 10 MVA distribution transformer filled with mineral oil, \nsynthetic ester and natural ester were carried out. Figure 3 shows the distribution of \ntemperature field in model of a 10 MVA distribution transformer filled with one of analysed \nliquid – mineral oil. \n Figure 4 shows the temperature distributions in the transformer, on the section of the \nwindings to the inner surface of the tank in the case of three types of insulating liquids. After \nreaching the steady state of the heat flow maximum temperature in the case of mineral oil \nequals 65.2 C, natural ester 66.3 C and synthetic ester 66.5 C. As we can see, the \ntemperature of the liquids in the case of natural ester is 1.1 C, and in the case of synthetic \nester 1.3 C greater than mineral oil temperature. Taking into the consideration of the 5 \ndegrees Clark right, which says that the temperature drop or rise of 5 C will result in \naccordingly twice lengthening or shortening life of the transformer insulation paper, these \ndifferences are important. This means that the use of natural or synthetic ester as an insulating \nliquid in transformer will raise the temperature. Consequently, it will contribute to shorten \nthe life of the transformer. \n      \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/477, 010 (2017) 71401053\n2016\n14 E3S Web of Conferences e3sconf/201\nEnergy and Fuels \n53 \n4\n \nFig. 3. The distribution of temperature field in 10 MVA distribution transformer filled with mineral \noil.  \n \nFig. 4. The distribution of temperature field in a model of 10 MVA distribution transformer in insulating \nliquid on the section of the windings to the inner surface of the tank, at the height of the inlet to radiator. \n5 Conclusions \nOn the basis of received results, we can say that the temperature of the transformer filled with \nesters is more than 1C higher than the temperature of the transformer filled with mineral oil. \nIn the case of transformer filled with synthetic or natural ester, higher temperature is caused \nby three times higher viscosity of natural and synthetic esters in relation to the mineral oil. \nAlso, higher temperature will influence negatively the operation of transformers filled esters. \n  \n  \n      \n  \nDOI: 10.1051/477, 010 (2017) 71401053\n2016\n14 E3S Web of Conferences e3sconf/201\nEnergy and Fuels \n53 \n5\nIn the case of power transformers (e.g. 160 MVA) temperature increase in transformers filled \nwith esters can be even greater as compared to the temperature of the transformer filled with \nmineral oil. Therefore, in order to use synthetic or natural ester, it should be considered the \nchanging the geometry of the transformer (increasing its size), the reduce of load or the \nmodification of cooling system. \nThe research was financed from resources of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education for \nstatutory activities No. 04/41/DS-PB/4240, name of the task: The Influence of Various Parameters on \nThermal Properties of Dielectric Liquids Used in High Voltage Transformer. \nReferences \n1.
