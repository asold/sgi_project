Survey of 1 /f 3 PN corner versus FoMTA (emphasizing tuning range\nand area) in LC -tank and ring oscillators.\nan impulse sensitivity function (ISF), which suggests that a\nsymmetric oscillation waveform could suppress any 1 /f noise\nfrom upconversion. The original ISF theory works well in\nexplaining ﬂicker PN in ring oscillators [4], [15], [16], but does\nnot clearly explain the origins of the asymmetric waveform in\nLC -tank oscillators and their ﬂicker PN mechanisms.\nBonfanti et al.[7] and Pepe et al. [8] claimed that the 1 /f 3\nPN in LC -tank oscillators is caused by the third-harmonic\ncurrent (i.e., IH3) entering the capacitive path of LC -tank,\nwhile Shahmohammadi et al. [9] demonstrated that it is the\nsecond-harmonic current (i.e., IH2), rather than IH3,e n t e r -\ning the non-resistive path, causing waveform asymmetries,\nwhich ultimately leads to the ﬂicker PN. Recently, these\ntwo pioneering but obviously conﬂicting explanations were\nuniﬁed in [12] concluding that both ill-behaved second- and\nthird-harmonic voltages (i.e., VH2 and VH3) result in the\nﬂicker noise upconversion, but VH2 dominates over VH3 in\nnMOS-only oscillators, while in complementary oscillators,\nVH3 is an order-of-magnitude larger than VH2. Compared\nwith its nMOS-only counterpart , the complementary oscilla-\ntor is more favorable for applications requiring low-power\nconsumption, limited swing (avoiding thick-oxide devices),\nelimination of additional biasing, and supporting standard\nsupply voltages [14]. However, a detailed quantitative analy-\nsis of a common-mode (CM) return path and ﬂicker noise\nupconversion in a conventional complementary oscillator is\nstill missing.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

(a) Conventional sw-cap tuning unit. (b) Model of a conventional 11 GHz LC -tank complementary oscillator. (c) DM current IH1 return path. (d) DM\ncurrent IH3 return path. (e) CM current IH2 return path.\nSeveral ﬂicker PN reduction mechanisms have been identi-\nﬁed [12]: 1) second-harmonic resonance [9], [10], [17]–[20];\n2) narrowing of the conduction angle (i.e., class-C)\n[11], [21]–[25]; 3) gate–drain phase shift based on an RC\ndelay [8], [26]. However, the second-harmonic resonance is\na narrow-band suppression technique, the narrowing of a\nconduction angle needs a careful consideration of start-up,\nand the gate–drain phase shift based on an RC delay suf-\nfers from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.\nThus, a new ﬂicker PN suppression technique that is wide-\nband and PVT-robust would be highly sought, especially\nfor supporting 5G/6G communications or other emerging\napplications [27]–[37].\nConcurrently, saving the silicon area has always been\ndesired by IC designers. This is especially true for\nLC -tank oscillators since the passive devices cannot scale\ndown with the technology advancements [31], [38]–[42].\nAlthough some researchers put active devices underneath the\ninductive structures at the cost of quality ( Q)-factor degra-\ndation [31], [41], [42], customarily, a sufﬁcient separation\nbetween the inductive devices and other sensitive blocks\nshould be kept to mitigate the electromagnetic interference\n(EMI). An 8-shaped inductor is a favorable solution to relieve\nthe EMI, but at the cost of a larger area and the Q-factor\ndegradation [43]. In [38] and [40], an ultra-compact 8-shaped\ntransformer-based oscillator was proposed with the switched-\ncapacitor (sw-cap) banks placed in the EMI-free regions to\nsave the area, but the long and ill-deﬁned differential-mode\n(DM) return path of the transformer signiﬁcantly worsens its\nQ-factor. On the other hand, ring oscillators beneﬁt from\nthe CMOS technology scaling, occupying a compact area\nwith a wide TR, and are not susceptible to magnetic pulling.\nHowever, both their thermal and ﬂicker PN are much worse\nthan in the LC oscillators, and they are highly susceptible to\nthe supply noise (i.e., high supply pushing).\nIn this article, we propose a complementary oscillator\nusing a triple-8-shaped transformer, simultaneously featuring\na compact area of 0.01 mm\n2, wide tuning range (TR) of 39%,\n1/f 3 PN corner of 70 kHz, and electromagnetic compatibility,\ncombining both beneﬁts of LC -tank-based and inverter-ring-\nbased oscillators (see the survey in Fig. 1) [14]. The rest of\nthe paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses in\ndetail the CM return path in a conventional complementary\nLC oscillator and analyzes quantitatively its ﬂicker noise\nupconversion mechanism.\nSection III presents a complete theory of the transformer’s\ngain and phase shift. Section IV discloses the proposed\ntransformer-based complementary oscillator design, fully clar-\nifying the ﬂicker noise upconversion mechanism in a com-\nplementary class-F operation, and reveals how the gate–drain\nphase shift can suppress it. Experimental results are shown in\nSection V.\nII. F\nLICKER NOISE UPCONVERSION AND CM R ETURN\nPATH IN COMPLEMENTARY OSCILLATORS\nFor the purpose of fully clarifying the mechanism of ﬂicker\nnoise upconversion in complementary oscillators, a conven-\ntional 11 GHz complementary class-B oscillator was designed\nin 22-nm FDSOI CMOS, as shown in Fig. 2(b). It comprises\nthe complementary cross-coupled switching pairs (M1-M2 &\nM3-M4) providing transconducance G\nm, main inductor Ldiff,\nCHEN et al.: FLICKER PN REDUCTION USING GATE–DRAIN PHASE SHIFT IN TRANSFORMER-BASED OSCILLATORS 975\nFig. 3.

The Cdecap, Ldecap,a n d Lbond\ncomponents model the decouplin g capacitor with its parasitic\ninductance, and bonding-wire inductance, respectively. Two\noff-chip supplies are used: VDD_A\noff-chip, VDD_D off-chip,\nsharing the global ground VSS off-chip. The “analog” power\ndomain (VDD_A/VSS_A) is for the Gm transistors, while\nthe “digital” power domain (VDD_D/VSS_D) is for the sw-\ncap banks. The separation of two power domains intends\nto avoid unwanted coupling from the sw-cap banks to the\noscillator’s core when incorporating this oscillator in a PLL.\nIt could further improve thermal PN by reducing parasitic\nCM capacitance of sw-cap banks seen by an nMOS-only\noscillator’s CM path [10].\nA. CM Return Path in Complementary Oscillators\nSince the non-resistive terminations of CM currents (e.g.,\nI\nH2) are the main contributor to the ﬂicker noise upconver-\nsion in nMOS-only class-B oscillators [10], [44], it would\nbe interesting to study the CM return path in its com-\nplementary counterparts by ﬁguring out the relationship\nbetween the CM currents generated by the pMOS and nMOS\ncoupled-pairs.\nA test-bench [see Fig. 3(a) and (c)] is set up where the\npMOS and nMOS transistors [modeling M3 & M1 in Fig. 2(b)]\nare given similar operating conditions as in Fig. 2(b). For\nexample, assuming V\nD ≈ 0.5VDD + VH1cos(ω0t) and VG ≈\n0.5VDD + VH1cos(ω0t + π), Fig. 3(b) and (d) reveal the phase\nof each harmonic current at the drain nodes of pMOS and\nnMOS (i.e., \u0003\n IH1–3,pMOS and \u0003\n IH1–3,nMOS), respectively. Due\nto the oscillator’s complementary conﬁguration in Fig. 2, VH1\nis saturated at around 0.5VDD (i.e., ≈ 0.4V), resulting in a rail-\nto-rail output swing for the single-ended output of Vout, p or\nVout, n. As shown in Fig. 3(b) and (d), when VH1 = 0.4 V , both\nIH1,pMOS and IH1,nMOS in the pMOS and nMOS coupled-pairs\nare out-of phase of VDS, demonstrating that the coupled-pairs\nwill behave like “negative” Gm in the oscillator. Interestingly,\nthe phase \u0003\n IH2,pMOS is around 0 ◦ (see Fig. 3(b)), while phase\n\u0003\n IH2,nMOS is −180◦ (see Fig. 3(d)), when VH1 = 0.4V . With\nthe consideration of their own opposite reference directions,\ntheir CM current will be ultimately in-phase, as shown in\nFig. 2(e). In other words, the CM current generated by the\nnMOS cross-coupled pair will be almost entirely absorbed\nby the pMOS cross-coupled pair with proper sizing of the\ntransistor width ratio W\npMOS/WnMOS.\nFurthermore, the complementary oscillator provides a well-\ndeﬁned CM return path due to the short physical distance\nbetween the local supplies of VDD_A and VSS_A, result-\ning in the parasitic inductance (i.e., L\ndecap)o fd e c o u p l i n g\ncapacitor (i.e., Cdecap) close to zero. Considering that Cdecap\ncan be large and also thanks to the low impedance of\n1/Gm of M1–M4, the CM voltage (e.g., VH2) is an order-of-\nmagnitude smaller than in an nMOS-only oscillator. Thus, the\nill-behaved VH2 is no longer the main contributor to the ﬂicker\nnoise upconversion, while the IH3 entering the capacitive\npath1 (see Fig. 2(d)), generating VH3, now starts playing a\ncritical role.\nB. Flicker Noise Upconversion and Numerical Veriﬁcation\nTo quantitatively study how VH3 affects the ﬂicker noise\nupconversion in the complementary oscillator of Fig. 2,\nwe increase the width WnMOS from 20 μm to 100 μm, while\nproperly sizing WpMOS/WnMOS to fully suppress VH2 and\nreducing the power supply level [see Fig. 4(a)] to maintain the\nsame power consumption. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the VH3/VH1\nratio increases from 4% to 13%, but VH2/VH1 remains much\nlower than 1% and VH1 keeps relatively constant [around\nVDD/2 = 0.4 V , see subﬁgure (a)]. The waveform shaping of\nVDS caused by IH3 entering the capacitive nature of the DM\ntank can be modeled by [12] and [13]\nVDS ≈ VH0 + VH1cos(ω0t) + VH3cos(3ω0t + π\n2 ) (1)\nwhich models VDS at the representative point:\nWnMOS =100 μm [see Fig. 4(d)]. Obviously, the strong VH3\nwill cause steeper falling edges and less steep rising edge,\nintroducing waveform asymmetries. The actual simulated VGS\nand VDS of M1 in Fig. 4(e) (including all harmonics) for the\npoint conﬁrm the observation.\nFig. 4(c) shows that PN at 10 kHz offset gets worsened\nsigniﬁcantly with the increase in VH3/VH1. Thus, the claim\nin [9] and [45] that the capacitive terminations of IH3 do\n1Interestingly, IH1 will partially enter the inductive path (see Fig. 2(c)),\ngenerating a little positive imaginary energy to balance the negative imaginary\nenergy due to IH3 entering capacitive path (i.e., “Law of Conservation of\nEnergy”).\n976 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 69, NO. 3, MARCH 2022\nFig. 4.

(f) Non-normalized ISF hDS and hDS · I1/f,rms.\nnot contribute to the ﬂicker noise upconversion is clearly not\napplicable to the complementary oscillator. To quantitatively\nstudy the ﬂicker noise upconversion, we employ the theory\nframework in [10]–[13], where the ﬂicker PN could be calcu-\nlated by\nL\n1/f 3 (\u0004ω) =\n\u0002\n1\n2 ·\n√\n2\n\u0004ωT0\n\u0003 T0\n0\nhDS(t) · I1/f,rms(t)dt\n\u00042\n(2)\nwhere I1/f,rms(t) is the periodically modulated rms value\nof ﬂicker noise current at a low offset frequency \u0004ω (e.g.,\n2π×10 kHz), T0 (= 2π/ω0) is the oscillation period, and\nhDS(t) is the non-normalized ISF associated with VDS of\nM1–M4 in Fig. 2(b). As shown in Fig. 4(f), the “less steep”\nrising part of VDS is more vulnerable to the noise impulse\ninjection than is its falling part. Thus, the ﬂicker noise\nI1/f,rms(t) introduces more positive phase change in its rising\npart (i.e., more positive area of effective non-normalized ISF\nh\nDS(t) · I1/f,rms(t)) than in its falling part, leading to the\nﬂicker noise upconversion. The above analysis is numerically\nveriﬁed with simulations covering different transistor widths\nof W\nnMOS and WpMOS, as shown in Fig. 4(c), thus proving the\neffectiveness of the method.\nIII. G ATE–DRAIN PHASE SHIFT IN TRANSFORMER -BASED\nCOMPLEMENTARY OSCILLATORS\nTo be able to further improve both the thermal and ﬂicker\nPN in the complementary osc illator, we replace the inductor\nin the conventional topology of Fig. 2(b) with a transformer\n(e.g., its turns ratio = 1:2), as shown in Fig. 5(a). A “2-port”\ntopology is employed to avoid two possible oscillation modes\n(i.e., low-frequency mode at ωL and high-frequency mode\nat ωH) in a transformer-based “1-port” topology [46]–[49].\nFig. 5.

For example, some speciﬁc X will enable a class-F\noperation [52] for third-harmonic extraction to generate low-\nPN mmW carrier [10], [53]. Besides, the passive gain A\nGD\nand gate–drain phase shift φGD for the fundamental oscillating\nwaveform in the transformer-based resonator [see Fig. 5(b)]\nalso depend on X, which has a large inﬂuence on both thermal\nPN and ﬂicker PN of oscillators.\nA. Gate–Drain Passive Gain AGD\nCompared with an inductor-based oscillator, the passive gain\nin a transformer-based oscillator could amplify the effective\nnegative resistance “−Gm”b y AGD times. Thus, for the same\nstart-up condition, the thermal PN part caused by 4 kT γgm\nnoise in a transformer-based oscillator is AGD times smaller\nthan that in an inductor-based oscillator. The relationship\nbetween AGD and X is derived based on a T -model [54]\nof the transformer-based resonator [see Fig. 5(b)], where M\n(= km\n√\nLD LG) is the mutual inductance, VG- and VD- are\nassumed as DM ac ground. Applying Kirchhoff’s law, the\nvoltage transfer function of VG/VD can be derived as [52]\nH (s) = VG\nVD\n= Ms\nα3s3 + α2s2 + α1s + α0\n(6)\nwhere α3 = CG LD LG(1 − k2\nm), α2 = CG(LG RD + LD RG),\nα1 = LD + CG RD RG,a n d α0 = RD.\nSubstituting s = jω0 and the quality factors of two coils\nat ω0 as QD = ω0 LD/RD and QG = ω0 LG/RG into (6), the\nfrequency response of the transformer-based resonator for the\ndrain fundamental waveform VD,H1 can be written as\nH ( jω0) = nkm\n(1 − k2m − 1\nQD QG )\u00052 − 1 + j ( 1\nQD − QD+QG\nQD QG \u00052)\n(7)\nwhere\n\u0005(X) = ω0\nωG\n=\n\u0005\n1 + n2 X −\n\u0006\n(1 + n2 X)2 − 4n2 X (1 − k2m)\n2(1 − k2m) (8)\nis the normalized oscillation frequency on ωG,a n d2\n⎧\n⎨\n⎩\nlim\nX→0\n\u0005(X) = 0\nlim\nX→∞\n\u0005(X) = 1.

Intuitively, with large capacitance at the gate\nnodes, the phase of the fundamental waveform is delayed from\nthe primary coil coupling to the secondary coil. In summary,\nfor a given transformer, AGD and φGD can be well-controlled\nby gate–drain capacitance ratio X (i.e., = CG/CD) in the\nresonator, which is independent of the tuned oscillation fre-\nquency ω0. Simulation (based on EMX S-parameter model)\nand theoretical results reach a good agreement as shown in\nFig. 6, demonstrating the efﬁcacy of the above analysis.\nIV . PROPOSED OSCILLATOR WITH A COMPACT\nTRIPLE -8-S HAPED TRANSFORMER\nIn this section, we propose an ultra-compact complementary\noscillator based on a triple-8 shaped transformer. Its ﬂicker\nPN is suppressed by inducing a positive phase shift in the\ntransformer.\nA. Design of Triple-8 Shaped Transformer With Compact Area\nAn 8-shaped transformer was proposed in [38] and [40] to\nsubstantially reduce the DCO area. However, its actual DM\nreturn path, including its VDD, VB lines, was neglected in\nthe analysis in [40], see Fig. 7(a). The excessively long VDD,\nVB lines signiﬁcantly limit the DM quality factors of both\nthe primary and secondary coils. Furthermore, they may also\nintroduce an additional magnetic ﬂux, as shown in Fig. 7(a).\nThe proposed 1:2 triple-8-shaped transformer-based oscil-\nlator is revealed in Fig. 7(b). 3D view and parameters of\nthe transformer are shown in Fig. 7(c). There are no sur-\nrounding V\nDD and VB lines, thereby ensuring a well-deﬁned\nDM return path and high Q for the compact occupied area\n(i.e., 0.01 mm 2). The proposed transformer is constructed\nin a coplanar interwound manner with three thick metal\nlayers (called JA, OI, and LB in FDSOI), and a native\nlayer (BFMOAT) is used to increase the high resistivity of the\nsubstrate, decreasing the eddy currents and further increasing\nthe Q. Its coil width of 3.6 μm and inner space of 1.8 μm\nare optimized in a 100 × 100 μm\n2 area, yielding the primary\nquality factor Qp ≈ 9, the secondary quality factor Qs ≈ 6.5,\nand km ≈ 0.7 for the intended frequency range. Two sw-\ncap banks are placed on the EMI-suppressed area, where\nthe magnetic ﬂuxes cancel each other due to the property\nof 8-shaped coils.\nTo further save the area and provide a deﬁned local CM\nreturn path, the required minimum capacitance for the on-\nchip decoupling capacitors should be considered. For a ring\noscillator, a large decoupling capacitance (e.g., ∼100 pF) may\nCHEN et al.: FLICKER PN REDUCTION USING GATE–DRAIN PHASE SHIFT IN TRANSFORMER-BASED OSCILLATORS 979\nFig. 8. Simulated (a) PN at 10 kHz and (b) VH2/VH1, VH3/VH1 with\ndifferent local decoupling capacitance Cdecap,local for X = 0.2.\nFig. 9. (a) Simulated input impedance Zin of the transformer-based resonator\nwith different X. (b) Simulated VH3/VH1, VH2/VH1 with different X.\nbe required to prevent the supply noise (especially, low-\nfrequency components) from converting to PN due to the ring\noscillator’s considerable supplypushing effects (typically, sev-\neral GHz/V) [15], [55], [56]. However, in transformer-based\noscillators, since they naturally feature low supply pushing\n(typically <100 MHz/V) [52], [57], the on-chip decoupling\ncapacitance is mainly to provide the local CM return path.\nFig. 8 suggests that once the local decoupling capacitance\nClocal,decap for the proposed transformer-based complementary\noscillator is larger than ∼10 pF, it can effectively suppress the\nsecond-harmonic voltage VH2 (also resulting in lower VH3),\nthus improving the ﬂicker PN.\nB. 1/f 3 Phase Noise in Complementary Class-F Oscillators\nAs per conclusions in Section II, the ﬂicker PN in com-\nplementary oscillators is mainly caused by the third-harmonic\ncurrent entering the capacitive path, while VH2 is suppressed\nby the complementary operation itself. Thus, to reduce the\nﬂicker PN, we may force the third-harmonic current IH3 to\nenter a resistive load, resulting in a complementary class-F\ntopology (i.e., ω\nH ≈ 3ω0). The additional resonance frequency\nωH of the transformer-based resonator as [48]\nωH\nω0\n=\n\u0014\u0015\u0015\u0016\n1 + n2 X +\n\u0006\n(1 + n2 X)2 − 4n2 X (1 − k2m)\n1 + n2 X −\n\u0006\n(1 + n2 X)2 − 4n2 X (1 − k2m)\n. (15)\nTo study how X affects the PN of the proposed oscillator,\nwe sweep X from 0.2 to 1.6 while maintaining the same\noscillation frequency ω0 and power consumption for a fair PN\ncomparison. Fig. 9(a) plots the resonator’s input impedance\nZin for three values of X while Fig. 9(b) shows the har-\nmonic voltage ratios (i.e., VH2/VH1, VH3/VH1) across X.B o t h\nωH and Zin(ωH) increase with rising X; speciﬁcally, when\nX ≈ 1.2, the class-F operation is achieved. The simulated\nthermal PN (e.g., PN at 10 MHz offset) and ﬂicker PN (e.g.,\nPN at 10 kHz offset) across X are plotted in Fig. 10(e).\nInterestingly, the exact class-F operation (i.e., ωH = 3ω0)\nis not necessary to help improve PN, but it will be useful for\nthe third harmonic extraction at mm-wave frequencies [10],\n[29], [53]. As shown in Fig. 10(e), the PN at 10 MHz offset\nkeeps almost constant from X = 0.6t o X = 1.6, not\nsigniﬁcantly improved by enhancing V\nH3 (i.e., X = 1.2). This\nphenomenon can be explained by our analysis in the previous\nsection that the improvement of thermal PN in the transformer-\nbased oscillators depends on the reduction in 4 kT γgm noise\nby the gate–drain passive gain AGD (rather than by class-F\nitself), which would be saturated when X is large enough.\nOn the other hand, there is a sudden, and rather unexpected,\nﬂicker PN degradation in the complementary class-F oscil-\nlator, even though its V\nDS waveform becomes squarish and\nsymmetric [see Fig. 10(a)] due to the class-F operation and\nthe ill-behaved VH2 (the main contributor of ﬂicker noise\nupconversion in nMOS-only class-F oscillators [9], [10]) being\nminimized by the complementary topology. To understand this\nspecial 1 /f noise upconversion mechanism, we simulate the\ncorresponding I\n1/f,rms and the effective non-normalized ISF\nhDS · I1/f,rms when X = 1.2 (i.e., class-F operation), as shown\nin Fig. 10(c) and (d). Due to the negative phase shift φGD\nof VGS against VDS by the transformer [i.e., φGD =− 4◦,\nsee Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 10(a)], the peak of VGS moves a bit\ncloser to the rising edge of VDS, leading to the higher I1/f,rms\n[see Fig. 10(c)] getting exposed to the rising edge of VDS.\nUltimately, it causes more positive area of effective ISF,\nhDS · I1/f,rms, see Fig. 10(d), resulting in the ﬂicker noise\nupconversion.\nC. 1/f 3 Phase Noise Reduction by the DeliberateφGD\nTo compensate for the more positive phase change caused\nby I1/f,rms in the complementary class-B [see Fig. 4(f)] or\nclass-F oscillator [see Fig. 10(d)], we could introduce a pos-\nitive gate–drain phase shift\n3 (i.e., φGD) in the transformer\n(see Fig. 6(c)). Per (12), with X decreasing, the peak of\nVGS moves towards the falling edges of VDS [see Fig. 10(b)],\nincreasing the exposure of I1/f,rms to the falling edges of\nVDS [see Fig. 10(b)], consequently resulting in a null area of\neffective ISF hDS · I1/f,rms [i.e., no ﬂicker noise upconversion,\nsee Fig. 10(d) and (e)]. It is worth noting that to get a\npositive drain-to-gate phase shift, some passive gain needs\nto be sacriﬁced (see Fig. 6(b) and (c)), which is the reason\nthat PN at 10 MHz offset is worsened in the small X region\n(e.g. X < 0.15). Practically, the proposed complementary\noscillator operates in the region of X < 0.3, achieving low\nPN, low ﬂicker PN, and wide TR, simultaneously. Fig. 10(e)\nalso illustrates the numerical veriﬁcation of PN at 10 kHz with\ndifferent X. The agreement between the calculations based\non (2) and simulations demonstrates the efﬁcacy of the above\nanalysis. Furthermore, Fig. 11 shows the post-layout simulated\n3Further, we predict that a negative phase shift of VGS against VDS could\nsuppress the 1/ f 3 PN in an oscillator with steeper rising edges of VDS\n(e.g. IH2 entering the inductive termination) [12].\n980 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 69, NO. 3, MARCH 2022\nFig. 10.

C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we establish that in a complementary class-\nB oscillator, the ill-behaved second-harmonic voltage can be\nfully suppressed by the complementary operation itself, while\nthe third-harmonic current entering the capacitive path is\nnow the main contributor to the ﬂicker noise upconversion.\nFor the complementary class-F oscillator, it is the negative\ngate–drain phase shift causing excess of ﬂicker noise I\n1/f,rms\nexposure to the rising parts of VDS, leading to the ﬂicker phase\nnoise. A robust and wide-band (39% TR) ﬂicker PN suppress-\ning technique was proposed, employing a gate–drain phase\nshift (adjusted by the capacita nce ratio) in a compact (i.e.,\n0.01 mm\n2), triple-8-shaped transformer-based complementary\noscillator.
