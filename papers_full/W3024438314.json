INTRODUCTION\nThe smart transformer (ST) is a solid-state transformer\nadopted as intelligent substation with control and communi-\ncation functionalities. The ST has a three-stage structure as\nshown in Fig. 1, including medium voltage (MV) converter\nstage, dc/dc converter stage, and low voltage (LV) converter\nstage. The MV converter is able to work with medium voltage\nlevel (e.g., 10 kV). It regulates the power/current absorption\nfrom the MV grid and deliver active power demanded from\nthe loads in the LV grid. The dc/dc stage interfaces the two dc\nlinks, transferring the power from the MV to the LV side and\nregulating the voltage of the LV dc-link. For the LV converter,\nit controls the voltage waveforms of the LV grid (e.g., 0.4 kV)\nto be sinusoidal and balanced independent from the load\ndynamics. Depending on the loading capability, the power\nrating of smart transformers can range from several hundreds\nKV A to several MV A [1]–[4].\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Salvatore Favuzza\n.\nFIGURE 1. Interactions between ST and DERs in a ST-fed microgrid.\nCompared to the conventional distribution transformer,\nthe ST offers connection to hybrid grid and is able to signif-\nicantly improve the demand response balance while keeping\na reasonable energy cost [5]. The ST could help solving\nsystem-level challenges, however it represents challenges\nitself. One of the main challenges of the ST comes from its\nLV grid: the ST-fed LV grid is likely to suffer from stability\nissues due to the interacting with grid converter-based dis-\ntributed energy resources (DERs) [6]–[8].

Zouet al.: Modeling and Stability Analysis of a ST-Fed Grid\nthe control dynamics and the ﬁlter resonances, the instability\nis characterized by harmonic oscillations, typically ranging\nfrom hundreds of hertz to kilohertz [7], [9]. In [6], [7],\nthe effects of the ﬁlter resonances on the stability of ST-fed\ngrid have been studied and the stabilization methods based\non active damping techniques were proposed to address\nthose issues. Nevertheless, the inﬂuences of the grid syn-\nchronization on the ST-fed grid stability has seldom been\ninvestigated.\nIn the conventional distribution grid, the effects of the\nthree-phase grid synchronization have already drawn wide\nattentions. The research starts with the input admittance\nmodel of grid converters considering the phase-locked loop\n(PLL) [10]. It is found a negative damping has been intro-\nduced by the PLL, which tends to compromise the stabil-\nity of the grid converters under the weak grid conditions.\nTo well study the impact of PLL on system stability, later\nresearch efforts have been put on the equivalent impedance\nmodels of grid converter served by PLL in both dq and\nαβframes [11], [12]. Moreover, a uniﬁed impedance model\nwas proposed for better evaluation of the dynamic inﬂu-\nences of PLL [13], where the mathematical relations between\nthe models in dq and αβ frames have been revealed. It is\nshown that the two different models have the identical sta-\nbility implications. In recent literature, the impact of PLL on\nthe transient stability has been further investigated. In [14],\nthe impedance model of the PLL-synchronized converter has\nbeen extended in dq frame for the stability analysis under\nthe case of large perturbation. In [15], the design-oriented\ntransient stability analysis of PLL-synchronized converter\nhas been studied during the grid faults conditions. From\nthese previous researches, it is seen that an asymmetric frame\nmodel could be obtained since the phase detection is realized\nthrough the q-axis channel of the PLL. In particular, a PLL\nwith high bandwidth could further decreases the negative real\npart of the q-axis impedance and therefore can destabilize the\nsystem stability in the distribution grid [10], [12]–[14]. For\nthis reason, the bandwidth of the PLL of grid converters in\nthe distribution grids has to be limited with the concern of\nsystem stability.\nIn contrast, this paper investigates the stability issues of a\nST-fed grid considering the effect of PLL. Different from the\nconventional distribution grid, the ST LV grid is supported by\nthe ST LV side converter instead of power transformer. This\nimposes new potentials regarding grid stabilization: since\nthe grid impedance is characterized by the ST LV converter,\nit can be modiﬁed by means of the ST voltage control and\nits control parameters. More speciﬁcally, the idea is to design\nan appropriate voltage control to reshape the grid impedance,\nso that the interactions between the grid impedance and the\nPLL-synchronized converter can be modiﬁed. With appro-\npriate control and parameters, the ST LV converter can sta-\nbilize all local converters equipped with PLLs. Comparing\nto the conventional distribution grids, the reshaping of the\nequivalent impedance is expected to be an indispensable\nservice provided to all the PLL-synchronized converters.\nIn addition, it can avoid complex design of the PLLs of the\nlocal converters.\nAs reported in [13], asymmetrical cross couplings between\nd- and q-axis of the overall system can be introduced due to\nthe PLL. For this reason, a multi-input multi-output (MIMO)\ndynamic model of the LV ST-fed considering the effect of\nPLL of the connected converters will be developed in this\npaper. The MIMO model can better reveal the characteristics\nof an asymmetric system (e.g., system in dq frame). For the\nstability assessment, the generalized Nyquist criterion has to\nbe used for the MIMO model. Based on the stability analysis,\na stabilization method based on the virtual impedance will be\nproposed to address the stability issue caused by the PLL.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: The system\nconﬁguration and the fundamental voltage control structure\nof the ST LV side converter are presented in Section II.\nTo include the effect of grid synchronization, the equiva-\nlent admittance of a grid-converter-based DER with a syn-\nchronous reference frame PLL (SRF-PLL) has been devel-\noped in Section III. The stability of the ST voltage control\nwith the equivalent admittance of DER is then assessed by\nusing the generalized Nyquist criterion, which is given in\nSection IV . In this section, the inﬂuences of different PLL\nbandwidth on the stability of the ST-fed grid have been\ndiscussed and a stabilization method based on the virtual\nimpedance has been proposed. Simulation and experimental\nresults are given in Section V to verify the effectiveness of\nthe proposed strategy. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI.\nII. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\nThe system conﬁguration and control scheme of a ST LV\nside converter is shown in Fig. 2a, where Lf and Cf are the\ninductor and capacitor of the LC ﬁlter; ZL represents the\nequivalent line impedance connecting to the point of common\ncoupling (PCC). The grid-converter-based DERs and AC\nloads can be connected to the PCC. The ST LV converter\ncontrols the voltage waveform of the LV grid. In most cases,\nthe ST generates sinusoidal and balanced three-phase voltage\nat the PCC independently from the connected DERs and\nloads. In addition, grid services like overload control and\nreverse power ﬂow control can be implemented to exploit the\nhosting capability [16], [17]. In this paper, the fundamental\nvoltage control of the ST LV converter is considered for the\nmodeling and stability analysis.\nIn literature, multiple feedback loop control strategies have\nbeen commonly employed for voltage control due to its\nease of implementation and good performance [18], [19].\nTo achieve overcurrent protection, the inductor current feed-\nback scheme is adopted for the ST LV side control in this\npaper. For the sake of simplicity, the zero-sequence compo-\nnent was not considered in this paper. Therefore, the detailed\nvoltage control as well as its one line block diagram is shown\nin Fig. 2b. Go,v and Gi,i are the transfer function matrices\nof the outer-loop and inner-loop controllers, where PI con-\ntrollers can be utilized to control the ST capacitor voltage\nand the inductor current in dq(0) frame.

However, the control dynamics of Yeq have to be\ntaken into account due to the increasing penetration of grid-\nconverter-based DERs in the LV grid. The detailed model of\nYeq including one grid converter is given in the next section.\nIn particular, the effect of the grid synchronization will be\nconsidered.\nIII. EQUIVALENT ADMITTANCE OF DER WITH THE\nEFFECTS OF GRID SYNCHRONIZATION\nThe control strategy applied to the grid converter consists\nmainly of two cascaded loops. Commonly, there is a current\nloop, which regulates the injected current, and an outer loop\nwhich controls the dc-link voltage as well as the injected\npower [20]. Since the dynamic of the outer loop is much\nslower than that of the inner loop as well as the PLL,\nthe outer loop can be neglected for the following modeling\nand analysis. A simpliﬁed system conﬁguration of a grid\nconverter is shown in Fig. 3a. The current control system is\nimplemented in dq frame and a synchronous reference frame\nphase-locked loop (SRF-PLL, shown in Fig. 3b) is employed\nfor grid synchronization. The detailed current control is pre-\nsented in Fig. 3c, where Gcc is the transfer function of the\ncurrent controller. In this paper, PI controllers are used for\ncurrent regulation.\nFIGURE 3.

Zouet al.: Modeling and Stability Analysis of a ST-Fed Grid\nNoting that all of the d and q components in (3) are obtained\nby applying the ideal Park transform T(θ0), namely these\ncomponents are directly oriented with the actual PCC voltage,\nand thus do not rely on the effect of PLL.\nAccording to the control scheme shown in Fig. 3c, the\nperturbation equation of current control can be written by\n[1v′\nrd\n1v′\nrq\n]\n=−\n[Gcc(s) 0\n0 Gcc(s)\n][1i′\nd\n1i′\nq\n]\n+\n[Gcc(s) 0\n0 Gcc(s)\n][1irefd\n1irefq\n]\n+\n[1v′\nd\n1v′\nq\n]\n(4)\nwhere [1irefd, 1irefq]T and [1i′\nd , 1i′\nq]T are the perturbations\nof the current references and grid current in dq frame, [1v′\nrd,\n1v′\nrq]T and [1v′\nd , 1v′\nq]T are the perturbations of the voltage\nreferences and grid voltage in dq frame. Here, the superscript\n(·)′denotes the corresponding components are obtained by\napplying T(θ′) using the detected phase angle θ′ from the\nPLL. This indicates the PLL dynamic would have an impact\non these control variables.\nTo decouple the PLL effects, the modeling procedures with\nsmall-angle approximation presented in [21] can be applied\nto the variables which correspond to the Park transform and\nits inverse. Then, the small-signal equations of the above-\nmentioned variables can be represented by\n[1v′\nd\n1v′\nq\n]\n=\n[1 VqGPLL (s)\n0 1 −Vd GPLL (s)\n][1vd\n1vq\n]\n(5)\n[1i′\nd\n1i′\nq\n]\n=\n[1id\n1iq\n]\n+\n[0 IqGPLL (s)\n0 −Id GPLL (s)\n][1vd\n1vq\n]\n(6)\n[1v′\nrd\n1v′\nrq\n]\n=\n[1vrd\n1vrq\n]\n+\n[0 VrqGPLL (s)\n0 −VrdGPLL (s)\n][1vd\n1vq\n]\n(7)\nwhere Vd and Vq are the dc quantities of the grid voltage, Id\nand Iq are the dc quantities of the grid current, and Vrd and\nVrq are the dc quantities of the voltage reference, in dq frame.\nGPLL (s) is the closed-loop transfer function of the SRF-PLL,\nwhich is\nGPLL (s) = Vd kpPLL s +Vd kiPLL\ns2 +Vd kpPLL s +Vd kiPLL\n(8)\nwhere kpPLL and kiPLL are the proportional and integral gains\nof the PI controller of the SRF-PLL.\nBy substituting (5)-(7) into (4), one can get the small-signal\nmodel of the grid converter, which is\n[1id\n1iq\n]\n=Yeq\n[1vd\n1vq\n]\n+Ieq\n[1irefd\n1irefq\n]\n=\n[Ydd (s) Ydq(s)\nYqd (s) Yqq(s)\n][1vd\n1vq\n]\n+\n[Idd (s) Idq(s)\nIqd (s) Iqq(s)\n][1irefd\n1irefq\n]\n(9)\nThe detailed expressions of the matrix elements of (9)\nare given in the Appendix. Here, the matrix Yeq in the\nﬁrst term of the model is the equivalent admittance of the\ngrid converter considering both synchronization and control.\nBy substituting (9) to (1), the impact of grid converter with\nthe effect of synchronization on the ST LV converter can be\ninvestigated.\nIV. STABILITY ANALYSIS OF A ST-FED GRID\nCONSIDERING GRID SYNCHRONIZATION\nThis section studies the stability issue of a ST-fed grid when\nconsidering the effects of PLL. A stabilization method based\non the virtual impedance is proposed to address the issue.\nA. IMPACT OF PLL-BASED SYNCHRONIZATION\nTo investigate the stability regarding the impact of grid syn-\nchronization, the equivalent admittance Yeq developed in\nSection III has been substituted to open-loop transfer function\nmatrix of the ST LV converter (1). The system parameters\nlisted in Table 1 are used for the stability analysis. In the\nanalysis, the proportional and integral gains of the PI con-\ntroller of the SRF-PLL have been changed, so that different\nPLL bandwidth can be obtained. The impact on the system\nstability can be studied by using the generalized Nyquist\ncriterion.\nTABLE 1. System parameters.\nFor the asymmetric MIMO system, the system stability\ncan be analyzed using the eigenvalues of the characteristic\nloci [22], [23]. Based on the open-loop transfer function\nmatrix of the ST LV converter, the eigenvalues of the char-\nacteristic loci can be deﬁned by [23]\nλ1,2(s) =Gop,dd (s) +Gop,qq(s)\n2\n±\n√[Gop,dd (s)−Gop,qq(s)\n2\n]2\n−Gop,dq(s)Gop,qd (s)\n(10)\nwhere Gop,dd , Gop,dq, Gop,qd , Gop,qq are the dd, dq, dq, qq ele-\nments of the open-loop transfer function matrix Gop. In case\nVOLUME 8, 2020 91879\nZ. Zouet al.: Modeling and Stability Analysis of a ST-Fed Grid\nFIGURE 4. Stability analysis of a ST-fed grid considering the effects of\nPLL: (a) Nyquist diagram of λ1 and (b) Nyquist diagram of λ2.\nthe eigenvalues fulﬁll the Nyquist criterion, the system is\nasymptotically stable [23].\nThe Nyquist diagrams of the two eigenvalues λ1 and λ2\nwith different PLL bandwidths are plotted in Fig. 4a and\nFig. 4b, respectively. The PLL bandwidths of the grid con-\nverter of DER are 20 Hz and 200 Hz in the two case studies.\nIn Fig. 4a, it can be seen that the Nyquist diagrams of λ1\nwith different PLL bandwidths are overlapping and there is\nno encirclement of the critical point (−1, j0). This indicates\nλ1 is insensitive to the PLL bandwidth and it does not suffer\nfrom stability issue. In Fig. 4b, the Nyquist diagrams of λ2\nhave different stability conditions, when using different PLL\nbandwidths. When a PLL with 20 Hz bandwidth is used,\nas plotted by the blue curve, the Nyquist diagram has no\nencirclement of (−1, j0), showing the system is stable. On the\nother hand, when a faster PLL with 200 Hz bandwidth is\nused, the Nyquist diagram plotted by the green curve has\nFIGURE 5. Root locus of the dominant poles of the qq element of the\nclosed-loop transfer function matrix.\ntwo clockwise encirclement of (−1, j0), indicating the system\nwith a faster PLL presents unstable behavior.\nTo better show the impact of PLL on system stability,\nthe root locus of the dominant poles of the qq element of the\nclosed-loop transfer function matrix is presented in Fig. 5.\nIn this root locus, the PLL bandwidth increases from 20 Hz\nto 200 Hz. It can be seen that a pair of poles gradually shift\nfrom the left half plane to the right half, when increasing the\nPLL bandwidth. Since the poles locate at the high-frequency\nrange, it is expected that the unstable behavior would be\nrepresented by the high-frequency oscillations.\nB. STABILIZED METHOD USING VIRTUAL IMPEDANCE\nFrom Fig. 5, it can be seen the poles of the qq element\nlacks of damping when high bandwidth PLL is applied to the\ngrid converter of DER. With this consideration, one intuitive\nway is to selectively enhance the system damping by using\nvirtual impedance. For a ST-fed grid, one promising way is\nto implement the virtual impedance in the ST voltage control.\nIn this way, the ST LV converter can reshape the equivalent\ngrid impedance so that enhance the system damping for all\nthe connected grid converters.\nFIGURE 6. Schematic of the proposed ST voltage control with virtual\nimpedance.\nTo achieve the target, a voltage control with the virtual\nimpedance on its q-axis has been proposed in this paper. The\ncontrol schematic is shown in Fig. 6, where a virtual resistor\nhas been added and highlighted in red. The updated open-loop\n91880 VOLUME 8, 2020\nZ. Zouet al.: Modeling and Stability Analysis of a ST-Fed Grid\nMIMO transfer function matrix of the ST LV converter and\nits control is given as follows\nGop =GdGo,vGi,iGLf ·[GLf(I −Gd) +Yeq +G−1\nCf\n+GdGLf(Gi,i −GVR) ·(Yeq +G−1\nCf )]−1 (11)\nwhere GVR is the transfer function matrix of the virtual\nimpedance.\nIt can be observed that the voltage control in d-axis remain\nthe same, since the virtual resistor in d-axis is zero. For\nthis reason, the major feature of λ1 can be preserved since\nit mainly depends on the control in d-axis. The Nyquist\ndiagram again does not have any encirclement of (−1, j0).\nNevertheless, for the Nyquist diagram of λ2 will be largely\naltered by tuning the introduced virtual resistance, and so\ndoes the system stability.\nFIGURE 7. Nyquist diagrams of λ2 when PLL bandwidth is 200 Hz: green\ncurve - using the conventional ST voltage control, magenta curve - using\nthe proposed ST voltage control.\nTo show the effectiveness, the Nyquist diagram of λ2 with\nthe proposed voltage control strategy (magenta curve) is pre-\nsented in Fig. 7. For comparison, the Nyquist diagram of λ2\nwith the conventional control (green curve) is shown in the\nsame ﬁgure. For both cases, a PLL with 200 Hz bandwidth\nhas been employed by the grid converter of DER. It can be\nseen that the Nyquist diagram plotted by the green curve\nhas two clockwise encirclement of (−1, j0), indicating the\noriginal system is unstable. When applying a 2  virtual\nresistor to the proposed ST voltage control, the Nyquist dia-\ngram plotted by the magenta curve has no encirclement of the\ncritical point any more, showing the system becomes stable.\nThe q-axis equivalent impedance of the ST LV converter is\nalso modiﬁed due to the virtual resistor. The Bode diagrams\nof the equivalent impedances with/without the virtual resistor\nare given in Fig. 8. It can be seen both the magnitude and the\nphase of the equivalent impedance have been reshaped when\nthe virtual resistor being applied.\nThe value of the virtual resistance can be tuned based\non the root locus of the dominant poles of the qq element\nFIGURE 8. Bode diagrams of the q-axis equivalent impedances of the ST\nLV converter: blue curve - without the virtual resistor Rd , red curve – with\nthe virtual resistor Rd .\nof the closed-loop transfer function matrix of the proposed\nvoltage control in Fig. 9a. In this case, the based value of 2\nis selected since it can maintain a minimum phase margin\nof 30◦. When the virtual resistance increases from 0 to 1 p.u.\n(based value is 2 ). It can be observed that a pair of poles\nmove from the right half plane to the left, with the increasing\nof the virtual resistance Rd . Nevertheless, the virtual resistor\non q-axis could introduce the asymmetric effect to the PCC\nvoltage. More importantly, seen from the zoomed ﬁgure of\nFig. 9b (the highlighted gray area), some poles will shift\ntowards the imaginary axis when a larger virtual resistance\nis used. This indicates the minimum phase margin of the\nsystem could be reduced when the virtual resistance further\nincreases. For this reason, a trade-off must be made consider-\ning the characteristics of all dominant poles. With the aid of\nthe Robust Control Toolbox TM of MATLAB/ Simulink, Rd\nof [0.75 p.u., 1.3 p.u.] is recommended to obtain a minimum\nphase margin of 30 ◦.\nV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nFor the validation, both simulation and experiments are car-\nried out in a 2-bus ST-fed grid, where a grid converter is\nconnected to the terminal of the ST LV converter. The current\ncontrol scheme in Fig. 3 is used for the grid converter, and the\nvoltage control schemes in Fig. 2 and Fig. 6 are used for the\nST LV converter. The system parameters given in Table 1 are\nused for both simulation and experiments.\nA. SIMULATION RESULTS\nTwo case studies are simulated by using the MATLAB/\nSimulink with the aid of the PLECS toolbox. Firstly, the effect\nof the SRF-PLL on the system stability is studied.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nTo better validate theoretical analysis and effectiveness of\ncontrol strategies, an experimental setup consisting of two\ncommercial inverters has been developed in the laboratory.\nThe system conﬁguration is presented in Fig. 11: two Danfoss\nFC302 inverters are used, one for the ST LV converter and the\nother for the grid converter of DER. A dSPACE 1006 is used\nFIGURE 10. Simulation results of ST voltage and current under different\nscenarios: (a) PLL bandwidth jump, from 20 Hz to 200 Hz and (b) with/\nwithout the virtual resistor.\nto achieve the control strategies as well as signal processing\nin real-time.\nFig. 12a shows the experimental results when the band-\nwidth of PLL changes. In the beginning, the ST-fed grid\nis running under stable conditions according to the wave-\nforms of the PCC voltage, the DER current, and the PLL\nphase angle. At the moment (that indicated by the dashed\nline), the bandwidth of the PLL increases from 20 Hz to\n150 Hz, the PCC voltage, the DER current and the PLL phase\nangle start to oscillate, showing the overall grid becomes\nunstable.\nIn order to stabilize the grid, a virtual resistor of 2 has\nbeen plugged into the q-axis of the proposed voltage control\nat the dashed line of Fig. 12b. The green curve represents the\nsignal of turn on/off the virtual resistor: low level - off, high\nlevel - on. Seen from Fig. 12b, all the waveforms includ-\ning the PCC voltage, the DER current, and the PLL phase\nangle gradually stop oscillation after the virtual resistor being\n91882 VOLUME 8, 2020\nZ.

CONCLUSION\nThis paper studies the modeling of a ST-fed grid and the\neffect of PLL-based synchronization on the system stability.\nLikewise conventional distribution grid, higher bandwidth\nVOLUME 8, 2020 91883\nZ. Zouet al.: Modeling and Stability Analysis of a ST-Fed Grid\nPLL is more likely to incur harmonic instability in a ST-fed\ngrid, due to the insufﬁcient damping ratio in the qq-axis.\nHowever, this does not imply a lower bandwidth PLL\nwould not incur any stability issue. In fact, a low band-\nwidth PLL could cause other kinds of instability as reported\nin [24]–[26], like low-frequency oscillation and voltage\ncollapse.\nFor the medium- or high-frequency oscillation, caused\nby the high bandwidth PLL, it can be alleviated by using\nappropriate voltage control of the ST. A stabilization method\nbased on the virtual impedance is proposed and can be seam-\nlessly implemented in the voltage control of ST LV con-\nverter. This method can effectively address the stability issues\ncaused by the high bandwidth PLL of local grid convert-\ners. Simulation and experimental results are given to verify\nthe effectiveness of the analysis as well as the stabilization\nmethod.\nAPPENDIX\nThe detailed expressions of the matrix elements of (9) is given\nin the followings.\nThe admittance matrix Yeq can be rewritten by\nYeq =\n[Ydd (s) Ydq(s)\nYqd (s) Yqq(s)\n]\n=\n[Ydd (s) Y ′\ndq(s) +2d (s)\nYqd (s) Y ′\nqq(s) +2q(s)\n]\n(12)\nwhere 2d (s) and 2q(s) are the equivalent admittance terms\nrelated to the effect of PLL.
