    "abstract": "The accuracy evaluation of instrument transformers is always a key task when proper control and management of the power network is required. In particular, accuracy becomes a critical aspect when the grid or the instrumentation itself is operating at conditions different from the rated ones. However, before focusing on the above non-rated conditions, it is important to fully understand the instrument transformer behavior at rated conditions. To this end, this work analyzed the accuracy behavior of legacy, inductive, and low-power voltage transformers over long periods of time. The aim was to find patterns and correlations that may be of help during the modelling or the output prediction of voltage transformers. From the results, the main differences between low-power and inductive voltage transformers were pointed out and described in detail.",
