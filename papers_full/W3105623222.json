Suicide is the second leading cause of death\nin the 15 to 29 year age group (WHO, 2014)\nwith a rising suicide rate of 35% in the US since\n1999 (Hedegaard et al., 2020). Extending clinical\nand psychological care to people showing suicidal\nideation relies heavily on identifying those at risk.\nTragically, 80% of patients do not undergo psychi-\natric treatment, and about 60% of those who died of\nsuicide denied having suicidal thoughts to mental\nhealth practitioners (McHugh et al., 2019). Recent\nstudies (Coppersmith et al., 2018) also show that\npeople exhibiting suicidal ideation make frequent\nuse of social media, e.g., Twitter, to share their\n1https://github.com/midas-research/\nSTATENet_Time_Aware_Suicide_Assessment\n           josh is so cute\n           Hiiii belated merry christmas and advanced happy new year buddy\n           My friends tell me its difficult to trust me since I keep joking all the time\n           I do not want to be alive, I just want to die today.

Without seeing the user’s re-\ncent historic tweet, which shows self-harm tendencies,\nit is difﬁcult to accurately assess suicidal risk. How-\never, analyzing a user’s tweeting history sequentially\nwithout factoring in time irregularities between tweets\nmay lead to an inaccurate representation of a user’s\nmental state. Time-aware modeling of the temporal de-\npendency between historic tweets reduces the impact\nof tweets from 3 years ago, providing a more realistic\nrisk assessment.All examples in this paper have been\nparaphrased for user privacy (Chancellor et al., 2019).\nmental state, with eight out of ten disclosing their\nsuicidal thoughts and plans (Golden et al., 2009).\nWhile recent advances in computational social\nscience (Coppersmith et al., 2018; Ji et al., 2019)\nhave made progress in assessing suicidal risk on so-\ncial media, analyzing the linguistic traits of tweets\nis often not sufﬁcient for accurate suicidal intent\ndetection. Additional user-level contexts such as\ntweeting history can be instrumental in identify-\ning a build-up of negative emotions that are of-\nten linked to suicide ideation (Oliffe et al., 2012;\nRobins et al., 1959). Such a build-up can occur\nweeks, months, or even years before the onset of\nsuicidal ideation (Overholser, 2003) and suicidal\nactivity can also be inﬂuenced by past ideation\nor suicide attempts (Van Heeringen and Maruˇsic,\n7686\n2003). Analyzing the user history and emotion\nspectrum, as shown in Figure1 can provide crucial\ncontext to estimate suicidal risk in a tweet authored\nby that user. Such anEmotional Historic Context\n(EHC)of a user over time can be characteristic of\ntheir mental health (Coppersmith et al., 2014).\nModeling temporal user context, either as a bag-\nof-tweets (Gaur et al., 2019), or sequentially (Cao\net al., 2019; Matero et al., 2019) helps in identi-\nfying suicidal intent. However, in Figure1, we\nshow that the impact of varying time intervals be-\ntween tweets is crucial for an accurate assessment.\nIt is critical to model the large gap between the\nuser’s recent tweets that are collectively indicative\nof suicidal intent and those three years apart. Such\nunevenTemporal Tweeting Irregularities (TTI)\nranging from seconds to years (Wojcik and Hughes,\n2019) between successive tweets inﬂuence the as-\nsessment of a user’s tweet differently. Sequential\nmodels such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs)\nnetworks assume that posting intervals are uniform,\nhindering the learning ability of a user’s emotion\nspectrum over varying time intervals.\nContributions: Taking into account a user’s\nemotional historic context and temporal tweeting\nirregularities, we propose STATENet:Suicidality\nassessmentTime-Aware TEmporalNetwork, a\nneural framework that evaluates the presence of\nsuicidal intent on social media(Sec.3.1). Building\non transfer learning’s success in Natural Language\nProcessing, STATENet uses a dual transformer-\nbased architecture to learn the linguistic and emo-\ntional cues in tweets. STATENet jointly learns from\nthe language of the tweet(Sec.3.2) to be assessed,\nand the historic Plutchik-based (Plutchik, 1980)\nemotional spectrum of a user in a time-sensitive\nmanner(Sec.3.3). Through a series of experiments\n(Sec.4) on real-world data(Sec.4.1), we show that\nSTATENet signiﬁcantly outperforms competitive\nmethods(Sec. 5), with the F1 Score of 80%. We\ndemonstrate practical applicability through a qual-\nitative analysis(Sec.5.4), and discuss the ethical\nimplications of this study(Sec.6).\nAt a minimum, we establish validity for time-\naware emotional temporal context for identifying\nsuicide ideation on social media. We focus on the\nintersection of NLP and suicidal risk assessment\nby taking a step towards improving risk assess-\nment in anon-intrusive manner. Our work could\nbe considered as a preliminary screening tool that\noptimistically forms a component in a larger in-\nfrastructure involving psychologists, health care\nproviders, and social media enterprises.2 In prac-\ntice, STATENet would ﬂag tweets as“at-risk”for\nsuicidality as part of a human-in-the-loop system\nto support decisions about potential intervention.\n2 Related Work\nTraditional Methods:Researchers have devel-\noped various psychoclinical methods to measure\nsuicidal risk (Pestian et al., 2016), such as the Sui-\ncide Probability Scale (Bagge and Osman, 1998),\nDepression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (Crawford\nand Henry, 2003), Adult Suicide Ideation Ques-\ntionnaire (wa Fu et al., 2007), Suicidal Affect-\nBehavior-Cognition Scale (Harris et al., 2015),\netc. While these methods are professional and ef-\nfective, they require participants to either answer\nquestionnaires (Venek et al., 2017) or engage in\ninterviews (Scherer et al., 2013), hence not reach-\ning suicidal people who are either unable to access\nthese resources or have a low motivation to seek\nprofessional help (Zachrisson et al., 2006; Essau,\n2005). Studies suggest that taking a suicide assess-\nment can negatively impact individuals showing\ndepressive symptoms (Harris and Goh, 2016).\nNLP Methods:In recent years, social media has\nshown promise in providing insights into the psy-\nchological state of individuals (Paul and Dredze,\n2011). Jashinsky et al.(2014) reported that Twitter\nis a viable tool for real-time monitoring (Braith-\nwaite et al., 2016) of suicide risk. Early efforts in\nutilizing social media include the use of user fea-\ntures (Masuda et al., 2013) and online suicide notes\n(Pestian et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2007). Since\nthen, the focus has been on using psycholinguis-\ntic lexicons such as LIWC (De Choudhury et al.,\n2016; Sawhney et al., 2018b) and textual features\nsuch as POS, tense, etc. for classiﬁcation (Ji et al.,\n2018; Huang et al., 2014). Shared tasks such as\nCLPsych (Zirikly et al., 2019) and CLEF eRISK\n(Losada et al., 2019) have seen a rise in the use\nof deep learning for suicidality prediction. CNN\nbased architectures (Du et al., 2018; Sawhney et al.,\n2018a; Shing et al., 2018; Naderi et al., 2019) and\nLSTM based architectures (Ji et al., 2018; Tadesse\net al., 2020) utilize pre-trained word embeddings\nto predict suicide risk. Although these text-based\nmethods capture the semantic nature of posts in\nisolation, no user associated context is provided\n2Similar to the type of algorithmic model deployed for\npost level screening on Facebook (Card, 2018).\n7687\nthat can give insight into the user’s mental state\nto improve predictive power (Venek et al., 2017).\nA user-dependent, personalized context can truly\nprocess the “natural” language of a user and under-\nstand the semantic context from the perspective of\nthat speciﬁc user (Flek, 2020). User context may\ninclude the user’s emotion spectrum (Ren et al.,\n2016), social graph methods (Mishra et al., 2019)\nand temporal context (Mathur et al., 2020). Sui-\ncide risk assessment for preliminary screening has\nbeen done at both binary (suicidal intent present,\nsuicidal intent absent) (Cao et al., 2019; De Choud-\nhury et al., 2016; Mathur et al., 2020; Losada et al.,\n2019), and multiple (Zirikly et al., 2019; Vioules\net al., 2018; Gaur et al., 2019) levels of risk ranging\nfrom no risk to severe risk.\nContextual Methods: The best performing\nmodel, the dual context BERT (Matero et al., 2019),\nat the CLPsych 2019 shared task (Zirikly et al.,\n2019) for suicidal estimation on Reddit exempliﬁes\nthe utility of temporal context. The Dual Context\nBERT utilizes post level BERT embeddings passed\nsequentially through an attention-based RNN. Sim-\nilarly, Cao et al.(2019) employ a LSTM and\nfastText-based architecture for modeling temporal\ncontext. These RNN and LSTM based approaches\nassume that users’ historical posts are equally\nspaced in time, hindering the suicide ideation de-\ntection model’s ability to learn their relative im-\nportance in a time-aware manner. Time-aware se-\nquential models have shown improvements in other\nclinical tasks (Baytas et al., 2017), such as patient\nsubtyping, and in other domains like user activ-\nity modeling (Zhu et al.). More recently,Mathur\net al.(2020) and Sinha et al.(2019) have mod-\neled a user’s historic emotion spectrum using latent\nrepresentations of GloVe embeddings of historic\ntweets. These latent features are then aggregated\nbased on speciﬁc functions such as exponential de-\ncay and sinusoids as opposed to learning them as\nsequences. These approaches assume that suicidal\nideation conforms to speciﬁc trajectories, which\nmay not generalize well across users (Giletta et al.,\n2015) and lose the context of individual historic\ntweets by aggregating them. Approaches besides\ndeep learning have also been explored, such as the\nwork done byVioules et al.(2018), which uses\nthe martingale framework (Ho, 2005) with senti-\nment scores and tweet level features such as likes\nto study two users on Twitter.\n \n \n \n \n \n𝒉𝑴−𝟐𝒊  \n 𝒉𝑴𝒊 \n𝒉𝑴−𝟏𝒊  \n \n  \n \n𝚫𝑴−𝟐 \n𝐻෩𝑀 \n \n𝒘𝟏 \n 𝒘𝑪 \n⋯ \n𝒕𝒊 \n 𝚫𝑴 \n𝚫𝑴−𝟏 \n𝐻෩1 \n⋮ \n \n \n𝑦෤𝑖 \n𝑦ො𝑖 \n𝑦𝑖 \n𝑻𝒊′ \n𝑻𝒊 \n𝑬𝟏𝒊ሬሬሬሬԦ \n 𝑬𝟐𝒊ሬሬሬሬԦ \n 𝑬𝑴𝒊ሬሬሬሬሬሬԦ \n⋮ \nFigure 2: STATENet: Model Architecture\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Notations and Problem Formulation\nWe acknowledge that modeling suicidal intent\nas a binary classiﬁcation task is a strong sim-\npliﬁcation and in this work, we focus on identi-\nfying the presence of suicide ideation within a\ntweet using a user-level temporal context. We\ndenote a tweet to be assessed for suicidal risk\nas ti 2 T = {t1,t2,··· ,tN} authored by a\nuser uj 2 U = {u1,u2,··· ,uM} made at time\n⌧icurr.

Static word embeddings\nsuch as GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) have been\nused to encode tweets for detecting suicide ideation\n(Sinha et al., 2019) in the past. However, recent\n7688\nstudies have shown that pre-trained transformer\nmodels yield more comprehensive representations\nof linguistic features in a tweet (Salminen et al.,\n2020). We found that SentenceBERT (Reimers and\nGurevych, 2019) empirically outperforms embed-\ndings used in previous works such as FastText (Cao\net al., 2019), ELMo (Mohammadi et al., 2019),\netc. We use the 768-dimensional encoding obtained\nfrom SentenceBERT.3 Formally,\nT0\ni = SentenceBERT(ti) (1)\nwhereT0i 2 R768 is linearly transformed using a\ndense layer toTi 2 Rd with dimensiond.\n3.3 User Historical Emotion Spectrum\nIndividual Historic Tweet Encoding:Ampliﬁ-\ncation of emotional factors such as emotional re-\nactivity (Tarrier et al., 2007), intensity (Links\net al., 2008) and instability (Palmier-Claus et al.,\n2012) can increase suicide risk. Building on this,\nwe extract the emotion spectrum of each historic\ntweethi\nk. Although proﬁcient in semantic model-\ning of text, general text encoders fail to capture the\nﬁne-grained emotions expressed in social media\nposts. To capture ﬁne-grained emotions, we uti-\nlize Plutchik’s wheel of emotions (Plutchik, 1980).\nThis taxonomy suggests three hierarchical sets of\neight emotions arranged as four pairs of opposing\ndualities. The primary set of emotions described by\nthe wheel are: Joy - Sadness, Surprise - Anticipa-\ntion, Anger - Fear, and Trust - Disgust. We obtain\nan encoding that models the emotional spectrum\nof a historical tweet, and thus that of a user at a\nhistoric time. Based on empirical comparisons and\nthe success of transfer learning in NLP, we ﬁne-\ntune pre-trained BERT embeddings on the Emonet\ndataset (Abdul-Mageed and Ungar, 2017). The\ndataset consists of a total of 1,608,233 tweets la-\nbeled across 24 emotions as per Plutchik’s wheel\nof emotions. The presence of the primary emotions\nin the dataset is skewed towards joy, sadness, and\nfear, with their representation being 20.57%,8.85%,\nand 6.13%, respectively, with other emotions hav-\ning fewer samples. These are labeled using distant\nsupervision using a total of 665 emotion hashtags.\nWe call this transformer the PlutchikTransformer.\nThis transformer tokenizes each historical post and\nadds the[CLS]token at the beginning of each post.\nWe use the ﬁnal hidden state corresponding to this\n3SentenceBERT computes the mean of output vectors for\nall tokens to derive a ﬁxed size sentence embedding.\n \n  \n 𝝈 𝝈 𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐡𝝈 𝒈(⋅) \n𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐡X + + \nX X \n𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐡\nΔ𝑘 𝐡𝒌−𝟏𝐢  h𝑘i 𝚫𝒌+𝟏 𝐡𝒌+𝟏𝐢  \n𝑯̃𝒌𝒊 𝑯̃𝒌−𝟏𝒊  \n𝑪𝒌−𝟏 𝑪𝒌 \n𝒐𝒌\n𝒕𝒌−𝟏 𝒕𝒌 𝒕𝒌+𝟏 \nX \nFigure 3: Architecture of a Time-aware LSTM cell.\nFigure is adapted fromBaytas et al.(2017).\n[CLS]token (768-dimensional encoding) as the\naggregate representation of the emotional spectrum.\nWe deﬁne the emotion vector (Ei\nk 2 R768) of each\nhistoric tweethi\nk as:\nEi\nk = PlutchikTransformer(hi\nk) (2)\nModeling Historical Tweets Sequentially:The\nemotional historic context of tweets can be used\nto model progressive emotional states of the au-\nthor of those tweets (Abdul-Mageed and Ungar,\n2017; De Choudhury et al., 2013). This makes re-\ncurrent neural networks (RNN), and particularly\nLSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), the\nmost natural methods for encoding and learning\nfrom a sequence of a user’s historical tweets.\nHowever, the time interval between the posting of\nhistoric tweets can vary widely, from a few sec-\nonds to a few years (Wojcik and Hughes, 2019).\nSuch variations can be an important factor in an-\nalyzing the emotional states of a user over time\n(Sueki, 2015). LSTM cells assume the input to\nbe equally spaced sequences and thus are unable\nto model irregularities in posting times of histori-\ncal tweets. Using this relative time difference be-\ntween the user’s historical tweets can progressively\nmodel the user’s emotions more accurately over\ntime. Hence, we propose the use of a Time-aware\nLSTM (T-LSTM) (Baytas et al., 2017) where time\nlapse between successive tweets is fed to the T-\nLSTM cell, as shown in Figure3. The T-LSTM\ncell thus incorporates the actual time differences\nbetween tweets, along with each historical tweet’s\nemotional contextEi\nk.\nT-LSTM applies time decay to the memory ac-\ncording to the elapsed time between successive\nelements and weights the short-term memory cell\nCS\nk . Intuitively, the greater the time elapsed be-\n7689\ntween two tweets, the less impact they should have\non each other. To achieve this, T-LSTM uses a\nmonotonically decreasing function of elapsed time,\nwhich transforms time into appropriate weights.\nTime lapses are incorporated in the T-LSTM as:\nCS\nk\u00001 = tanh(WdCk\u00001 + bd) (Short-term memory)\nˆCS\nk\u00001 = CS\nk\u00001 ⇤ g(\u0000k) (Discounted short-term memory)\nCLT\nk\u00001 = Ck\u00001 + CS\nk\u00001 (Long-term memory)\nC⇤\nk\u00001 = CLT\nk\u00001 + ˆCS\nk\u00001 (Adjusted previous memory)\nwhereCk\u00001 andCk are previous and current cell\nmemories, and{Wd,bd} are network parameters.\n\u0000k is the elapsed time between historic tweetshk\u00001\nand hk, andg(· ) is a heuristic decaying function\nthat reduces the effect of short-term memory as\u0000k\nincreases. We selectg(\u0000k)=1 /\u0000k empirically\nand as suggested inBaytas et al.(2017). For each\nhistoric tweethi\nk, the T-LSTM cell modiﬁes LSTM\ngate operations to compute the current hidden state\n( ˜Hi\nk 2 Rd) by feedingC⇤\nk\u00001 instead ofCk\u00001.\n3.4 Joint Network Optimization\nTo identify the presence of suicidal intent in a tweet,\nSTATENet jointly learns from the language of the\ntweet to be assessed and the emotional historic\nspectrum in a time-aware manner. For this we ap-\nply the concatenation operation\u0000 to Ti and ˜Hi\nk\nrespectively, followed by a dense layer with Recti-\nﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU)( Hahnloser et al., 2000)\nto form a prediction vector. Finally, a softmax func-\ntion (Goodfellow et al., 2016) is used to output the\nprobabilities of suicidal intent present.\n˜yi = ReLU(Wy(Ti \u0000 ˜Hi\nk)+ by)\nˆyi = softmax(˜yi) (3)\nwhere ˆyi is the ﬁnal suicide risk assessment and\n{Wy,by} are network parameters.\nTweet indicating suicidal intent form a very\nsmall proportion of the data (Ji et al., 2019). To ad-\ndress this problem of class imbalance(in practice,\nthe imbalance is much greater in the real world),\nwe train STATENet using Class-Balanced loss pro-\nposed byCui et al.(2019) along with Focal Loss\n(Lin et al., 2017). This loss function applies a\nclass-wise re-weighting scheme by introducing a\nweighting factor that is inversely proportional to\nthe number of samples. The loss functionL is:\nL = CBfocal(ˆyi,yi; \u0000,\u0000) (4)\nwhereCBfocal is class-balanced focal loss,ˆyi is\nthe predicted label andyi is the label of the current\ntweet.\u0000 and\u0000 are hyperparameters.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Dataset\nWe use the Twitter timeline data of users from the\ndataset introduced bySinha et al.(2019). Sinha\net al.(2019) began with a collection of Twitter posts\nbased on a lexicon of 143 suicidal phrases. After\nmanual inspection of the dataset for trivially non-\nsuicidal tweets, their ﬁnal dataset contained 34,306\ntweets. Some of these tweets were authored by the\nsame user; thus, the total number of unique users\nfor which tweets were to be classiﬁed was 32,558.\nWe summarize the annotation instructions (Sawh-\nney et al., 2018b) that were followed by two an-\nnotators, both students of Clinical Psychology, for\nannotating the collected 34,306 tweets:\n• Suicidal Intent (SI) Present: Posts where\nsuicide ideation or previous attempts are dis-\ncussed in a somber and non-ﬂippant tone.\n• Suicidal Intent (SI) Absent: Tweets with no\nevidence for risk of suicide, including song\nlyrics, condolence message, awareness, news.\nIt is important to note that this process produced\nsuicide risk labels at the level of individual tweets\nand not for individual user histories. An acceptable\ninter-annotator agreement was achieved with a Co-\nhen’s Kappa score (Cantor, 1996) of 0.72, under the\nsupervision of a professional clinical psychologist.\nThe resulting dataset contains 3984 suicidal tweets.\nThe Twitter timeline was collected for each user.\nThese timelines span over ten years from 2009 to\n2019. The mean number of tweets in user history is\n748(max 3,200)with a standard deviation of 789\ntweets. We trim the user history to the 100 most\nrecent tweets for users with a large number of his-\ntorical tweets.4 The mean time difference between\ntwo consecutive tweets for a user is two days with a\nstandard deviation of almost 24 days between two\ntweets, indicative of large variations across users.\n4070 users were found to have no historical tweets.\nData Preprocessing:We deidentiﬁed the dataset\nby performing named entity recognition and re-\nmoving any identiﬁable information such as email\n4This was done due to memory and computation con-\nstraints faced during the training of STATENet.\n7690\naddresses, URLs, and names. Next, we follow stan-\ndard procedures of converting the text to lowercase,\nremoving punctuation and accents, striping whites-\npaces, and removing stopwords. We split the tweets\nin the dataset on the basis of users such that there\nis no overlap between users in the train, validation,\nand test set. We perform a stratiﬁed 70:10:20 split\nacross the three sets, such that the train, valida-\ntion, and test sets consist of 24014, 3431, and 6861\ntweets, respectively. Although there may be mul-\ntiple tweets to be assessed by the same user, their\nassociated history differs according to the tweets’\nposting timestamps. We ensure that for each tweet\nto be classiﬁed, only the historical tweets having\ntimestamps older than that of the tweet to be as-\nsessed are used for historic modeling.\n4.2 Experimental Settings\nBaseline Methods:We evaluate STATENet us-\ning the macro F1 and recall forsuicidal intent\npresent(recalls), against two types of baseline\nmethods; tweet level (TL) and user-level (UL). UL\nbaselines were adapted for tweet level assessment\nby concatenating embeddings of the tweet to be\nassessed with the user level features.\nRandom Forest + Tweet features(Sawhney\net al., 2018b): A non contextual TL approach\nthat applies Random Forests (RF) with tweet level\nfeatures including statistical, LIWC (Pennebaker\net al., 2001) features, n-grams and POS counts.\nC-LSTM (Sawhney et al., 2018a): We replicate\nthe TL deep Neural Network that uses CNN to cap-\nture local features and LSTMs for tweet encoding.\nSuicide Detection Model (SDM)(Cao et al.,\n2019): UL model that encodes tweets using ﬁne-\ntuned FastText embeddings. Historic tweets were\npassed sequentially through LSTM + attention and\nconcatenated with the tweet to be assessed.\nContextual CNN (Gaur et al., 2019): Non-\nsequential UL model using GloVe embeddings for\nencoding tweets. Bag of tweets were concatenated\nand fed to a contextual CNN (Shin et al., 2018).\nExponential Decay(Sinha et al., 2019): TL\nmodel that weighs GloVe embeddings of historic\ntweets through an exponential decay function and\nensembles it with the GloVe embedding trained on\na BiLSTM + Attention for the tweet to be assessed.\nSurprise and Episodic Modeling(Mathur et al.,\n2020): Decision level ensemble TL model similar\nto Exponential Decay, but factors in sinusoidal and\nwhite Gaussian noise for historic tweet modeling.\nDualContextBert(Matero et al., 2019): Best per-\nforming UL model at CLPsych 2019. DualCon-\ntextBert uses BERT for encoding Reddit posts fed\nto an attention-based RNN layer. In our implemen-\ntation, we use all the user’s historic tweets.\nExperimental Setup:We select hyperparame-\nters based on the highest Macro F1 obtained on the\nvalidation set for all models. We use grid search to\nexplore: number of features in hidden state˜HD 2\n{8,64,128,256,512}, number of LSTM layers\nn 2 {1,2,5}, dropout\u0000 2 {0.0,0.1,··· ,0.5},\n\u0000 2 {0.99,0.999,0.9999} and\u0000 2 {1.0,1.5,2.0}\nin class-balanced focal loss, initial learning rate\nIlr 2 {0.01,0.001,0.0005,0.0001}, warm-up\nstepsSws 2 {3,5,7}. The optimal hyperparam-\neters were found to be:˜HD = 512, n =1 ,\n\u0000 =0 .5, \u0000 =0 .9999, \u0000 =2 .0, Ilr =0 .0001,\nSws =5 . We implement all methods with Py-\nTorch 1.5 (Paszke et al., 2019) and optimize using\nmini-batch AdamW with a batch size of 256 and\nIlr =0 .0001. We use the cosine scheduler with\na warmup step of 5 (Gotmare et al., 2018). We\ntrain the model for 20 epochs and apply early stop-\nping with a patience of 5 epochs. The model takes\n4,361s to train on an Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU.\n5 Results and Analysis\n5.1 Comparative Performance\nWe note from Table1 that STATENet signiﬁcantly\n(p< 0.005) outperforms competitive baselines.\nWe compare against both text only, and temporal\ncontextual models for suicidal risk assessment.\nSTATENet and other contextual models perform\nbetter than the non-contextual RF + tweet features\nand C-LSTM models. We believe this is because\ntemporal contextual models offer greater insight\ninto the author’s historical mental state, thereby\nincreasing predictive power. STATENet and se-\nquential models outperform the Contextual CNN,\nlikely due to their ability to better learn represen-\ntations from the temporal dependence in historical\ntweets, as opposed to Contextual CNN’s bag of\ntweets approach. We also observe that STATENet\nsigniﬁcantly outperforms competitive sequential\nmodels. We postulate this to the ability of the time-\naware LSTM in STATENet to capture irregularities\nin tweeting intervals of users. Such time-aware\nmodeling likely learns more accurate latent rep-\nresentations of users’ emotional historic context.\nWhile exponential decay and episodic modeling\n7691\nType of Contextual Modeling Model Macro F1 \" Recalls \" Accuracy\"\nNone Random Forest + Tweet features 0.536 0.513 0.548\nC-LSTM 0.588 0.597 0.602\nNon Sequential Contextual CNN 0.729 0.587 0.803\nSequential Suicide Detection Model (SDM) 0.743 0.755 0.819\nDualContextBert 0.767 0.786 0.823\nSpeciﬁc Temporal Functions Exponential Decay 0.737 0.759 0.828\nSurprise and Episodic Modeling 0.741 0.762 0.831\nTimeaware Sequential STATENet 0.799 * 0.810* 0.851*\nTable 1: Mean of results obtained over 10 different runs. * indicates that the result is signiﬁcantly better than\nDualContextBert (p< 0.005) under Wilcoxon’s Signed Rank test).Bolddenotes best performance.\nModel Component Macro F1 \" Recalls\"\nCurrent tweet only 0.731 0.551\nCurrent + Random History(Plutchik) 0.730 0.608*\nCurrent + Sequential History(BERT) 0.767* 0.786*\nCurrent + Sequential History(Plutchik) 0.778* 0.795*\nCurrent + TA History(Plutchik) 0.799* 0.810*\nTable 2: Ablation study over STATENet.

We believe this\nis because not every user’s emotional historic con-\ntext may conform to ﬁxed trajectories that these\napproaches aggregate historic tweets on.\n5.2 Ablation Study\nTo assess EHC and TTI, we perform an ablation\nstudy (Table2) with different conﬁgurations. With-\nout considering historic tweets, the performance\nof the model drops drastically. We believe that\nadding historic tweets, even in a random order,\nadds additional contextual cues about the user, re-\nsulting in improved performance. We observe that\nthe PlutchikTransformervariant of Current + Se-\nquential History outperforms itsBERT counter-\npart. This can be attributed to the ability of the\nPlutchikTransformerto capture the EHC of a user.\nSTATENet jointly models the Current Tweet and\nEHC in a time-aware manner, overcoming the limi-\ntation of previous models that assume equal time\nintervals between posts. On inspecting the results\nfor the 647 users without any historic tweets, we\nﬁnd that STATENet performs well with a recall\nof 0.74 and macro F1 of 0.75.

This is particularly\ninteresting, as, for users with no available history,\nassessment can still be performed to some degree.\n5.3 Temporal Analysis\nThe tweet’s language should be studied with his-\ntorical context to better understand the user’s emo-\ntional state over time, based on the EHC. To an-\nalyze the importance of the order and temporal\ndependency of historic tweets, we ﬁrst try a non-\nsequential, bag of tweets like variant. We feed the\nPlutchik transformer-based encodings to a Contex-\ntual CNN. We observe that the bag of tweets ap-\nproach is slightly better than the Contextual CNN\nbaseline, likely because of the transformer-based\nencoding as opposed to static GloVe embeddings\nused by the baseline. The non-sequential approach\ndrastically underperforms over ten runs in com-\nparison to temporal variants. Further investigat-\ning EHC and TTI, we ﬁrst feed historic tweets in\nsequential order (Sequential Model) to a regular\nLSTM, and then we factor in TTI through T-LSTM\nin STATENet. Figure4 shows that STATENet is\n7692\nUser 1 User 2 User 3\nti [14/07/2017]: i dont want\nto be here anymore again\n(SI Present)\n[08/03/2016]: been a year\nsince i lost the most\nimportant woman the loss\nhas never sunk (SI Absent)\n[05/01/2019]: Nobody be\nshocked when I snap and\ntake a life either my own\nor theirs (SI Present)\nhi\nk3 [13/07/2017]: yes i almost tried\nto kill myself again tonight yes it is\nonly been ten minutes and im now\nretweeting tweets\n[16/11/2015]: i wrote this a year\nago today and one year on i am box-\ning things up and moving into my\nown house it is crazy\n[29/12/2018] when you said your\nlast goodbye, i die a little bit inside,\ni lay in tears in bed all night, alone\nwithout you by my side\nhi\nk2 [27/05/2017]: i do not know if its\nseasonal depression or just me avoid-\ning christmas by staying in all day\n[19/11/2014]: I don’t think i will\nsee the end of today, there is nothing\nleft for me to do\n[21/12/2018]: Do you collect any-\nthing.

For\nthe difference in performance between the Sequen-\ntial Model and STATENet, we believe that is due\nto the temporal dependency of historic tweets on\nthe elapsed time between successive tweets.\n5.4 Qualitative Analysis\nFor a detailed insight and aiding interpretabil-\nity, we analyze some cases where STATENet per-\nforms well. We also highlight the limitations of\nSTATENet through error analysis. We qualitatively\nanalyze three interesting cases in Table3 and Fig-\nure5. We see that the tweet to be assessed for User\n1 does not show any explicit suicidal intent and\nalone may not be sufﬁcient to assess suicidal risk.\nHowever, temporal models correctly classify the\ntweet as they learn the build-up of sadness in the\nhistoric tweets, which we observe from the Pluchtik\nemotional intensity in Figure5a.\nWhen the current tweet of the user is non-\nindicative, temporal models can get additional con-\ntext by learning historic activity of the user. Often,\ntemporal patterns are variable, and posting frequen-\ncies vary drastically. These TTI present challenges\nin only relying on the sequence of historic tweets\nrather than the actual time lapses. For instance, ini-\ntial tweets of User 2 showed sadness and suicidal\nintent, whereas the recent historic tweet (h2\nk3) of\nthe user represents joy (Figure5b). LSTM-based\nmodels aggregate sadness and hence assume the\nhistory to be suicidal. Contrarily, STATENet is able\nto learn from the variable time-lapses and their rel-\native importance in the context of suicide ideation.\nHowever, we found some cases where all models\nfailed. For User 3, the current tweet does not con-\ntain strong semantic indicators of suicidal intent.\nMoreover, historic tweets do not show any recog-\nnizable emotional pattern (Figure5c). Such a case\npresents the complexities associated with suicide\nrisk assessment.Another interesting observation\nfrom Figure5 is that the learned Plutchik emotion\n7693\nintensity distribution for users is skewed towards\njoy (positive) and sadness (negative). Although the\nhighly granular emotional context captured by the\nPlutchikTransformer improves STATENet’s perfor-\nmance (Sec.5.2), over the more generic language\nfeatures captured by BERT. We leave further ex-\nploring the impact of emotion granularity to our\nfuture research directions.\n6 Discussion\nEthical Considerations:The preponderance of\nthe work presented in our discussion presents\nheightened ethical challenges. As explored inCop-\npersmith et al.(2018), we address the trade-off\nbetween privacy and effectiveness. While data is es-\nsential in making models like STATENet effective,\nwe must work within the purview of acceptable\nprivacy practices to avoid coercion and intrusive\ntreatment. To that end, we utilize publicly available\nTwitter data in a purely observational (Norval and\nHenderson, 2017; Broer, 2020), and non-intrusive\nmanner. Although informed consent of each user\nwas not sought as it may be deemed coercive, au-\ntomated de-identiﬁcation of the dataset was per-\nformed to reduce the risk of including any identi-\nfying data in the raw data. All tweets shown as\nexamples in Figure1 and Section5.4 have been\nparaphrased as per themoderate disguisescheme\nsuggested inBruckman(2002) to protect the pri-\nvacy of individuals (Fiesler and Proferes, 2018).\nThe annotation of user data has been kept separately\nfrom raw user data on protected servers linked only\nthrough anonymous IDs (Benton et al., 2017). As-\nsessments made by STATENet are sensitive and\nshould be shared selectively to avoid misuse, such\nas Samaritan’s Radar (Hsin et al., 2016). Our work\ndoes not make any diagnostic claims related to sui-\ncide. We study the social media posts in a purely\nobservational capacity (Norval and Henderson,\n2017) and do not intervene with the user experi-\nence in any way.\nLimitations: We acknowledge that studying sui-\ncidality is subjective in nature (Keilp et al., 2012)\nand that the interpretation of the analysis presented\nmay vary across individuals. Due to the situat-\nedness of language, the studied data may be sus-\nceptible to demographic, annotator, and medium-\nspeciﬁc biases (Hovy and Spruit, 2016). We recog-\nnize that suicide risk exists on a diverse spectrum,\nand the simpliﬁcation of binary labels could lead to\nartiﬁcial notions of risk (Bryan and Rudd, 2006).\nPractical Implications:Through STATENet,\nwe suggest a neural architecture for preliminary\nscreening of at-risk users on social media to aid\nthe prioritization of clinical resources. Our work\nobserves Twitter in a non-intrusive manner and\ndoes not intervene with the user experience in any\nway. STATENet should form part of a distributed\nhuman-in-the-loop (de Andrade et al., 2018) sys-\ntem for ﬁner interpretation of risk. Focusing on\nSTATENet’s practical applicability, we work with\ntweet level annotations rather than the more sub-\njective and difﬁcult to scale user-level annotations.\nWe emphasize on tweet-level prediction; however,\nSTATENet can also be applied for user-level sui-\ncide risk assessment given its dual text and historic\nmodeling components.\n7 Conclusion\nMotivated by the rising use of social media for ex-\nhibiting suicide ideation as opposed to standard\nclinical practice (McHugh et al., 2019), we present\nSTATENet. Building on psychological studies on\nanalyzing a user’s temporal emotional spectrum,\nSTATENet models the time aware emotional con-\ntext of users through historical tweets for more\naccurate suicide risk estimation on social media.\nWe plan to explore the impact of varying amounts\nof historical context for a user in our future work.\nWe show STATENet’s applicability as a prelimi-\nnary tool in assessing suicidality in tweets. We\npresent a qualitative analysis for a deeper under-\nstanding of STATENet. Through this work, we aim\nto form a component in a larger human-in-the-loop\ninfrastructure for analyzing potentially concerning\nsuicide-related social media posts. Priority-based\nsuicide risk assessment for ranking tweets for sui-\ncidal risk, rather than classifying them forms our\nfuture direction. Additionally, in the future, we\nwould also want to quantify the impact of vary-\ning degrees of granularity of learning emotional\nfeatures from tweets on STATENet’s performance.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to think Alex Polozov, Kawin Etha-\nyarajh, Sebastian Gehrmann, Siva Reddy, and the\nanonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful\nfeedback and comments.\n7694\nReferences\nMuhammad Abdul-Mageed and Lyle Ungar. 2017.\nEmoNet: Fine-grained emotion detection with gated\nrecurrent neural networks.
