Casacuberta 1* and\nRaúl Castanera 1*\nAbstract\nBackground: Transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genomic variability in eukaryotic genomes.\nTheir activity impacts genome architecture and gene expression and can lead to drastic phenotypic changes.\nTherefore, identifying TE polymorphisms is key to better understand the link between genotype and phenotype.\nHowever, most genotype-to-phenotype analyses have concentrated on single nucleotide polymorphisms as they\nare easier to reliable detect using short-read data. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify\ntransposon insertions from resequencing data using short reads. Nevertheless, the performance of most of these\ntools has been tested using simulated insertions, which do not accurately reproduce the complexity of natural\ninsertions.\nResults: We have overcome this limitation by building a dataset of insertions from the comparison of two high-\nquality rice genomes, followed by extensive manual curation. This dataset contains validated insertions of two\nvery different types of TEs, LTR-retrotransposons and MITEs. Using this dataset, we have benchmarked the sensitivity\nand precision of 12 commonly used tools, and our results suggest that in general their sensitivity was previously\noverestimated when using simulated data. Our results also show that, increasing coverage leads to a better\nsensitivity but with a cost in precision. Moreover, we found important differences in tool performance, with some\ntools performing better on a specific type of TEs. We have also used two sets of experimentally validated insertions\nin Drosophila and humans and show that this trend is maintained in genomes of different size and complexity.\nConclusions: We discuss the possible choice of tools depending on the goals of the study and show that the\nappropriate combination of tools could be an option for most approaches, increasing the sensitivity while\nmaintaining a good precision.\nKeywords: Benchmark, Transposable elements, Polymorphism, Transposon insertion, Resequencing\nBackground\nTransposable elements (TEs) constitute a very important\nfraction of eukaryotic genomes , and their ability to trans-\npose, excise and produce complex genomic rearrangements\nmake them a key source of genomic diversity. Previous\nwork done over the last decades has uncovered their enor-\nm o u sp o t e n t i a la sg e n er e g u l a t o r s ,ar o l et h a tT E sp l a y\nthrough a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms\n[12, 43]. Certain TEs, such as Long Terminal repeat (LTR)-\nretrotransposon carry their own promoters, and their\ninsertion close to genes can generate new gene expression\npatterns. In addition, TEs, and in particular LTR-\nretrotransposons and MITEs (Miniature Inverted Trans-\nposable Elements), have been shown to contain transcrip-\ntion factor binding sites, which can be mobilized by\ntransposition rewiring new ge nes into pre-existing tran-\nscriptional networks [ 5, 12, 20]. As a consequence, TEs\nhave the potentiality to generate important genomic and\ntranscriptional variability, and the interest in these elements\nhas drastically increased in the last years.\nDue to their repetitive nature and their sequence\ndiversity, the annotation of TEs is more complex than\nthat of protein coding genes. Nevertheless, thanks to the\ndevelopment of tools such as Repeatmasker ( http://\nwww.repeatmasker.org) and sophisticated pipelines such\n© The Author(s). 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

The\navailability of high-quality reference genomes coupled\nwith the exponential increment of resequencing data has\nboosted our capacity to evaluate intraspecific variability.\nBy obtaining accurate maps of genetic variation, charac-\nterizing the genetic basis of phenotypic variance is now\npossible at a genome-wide scale thanks to association\nstudies (GWAS). Until now, most of the efforts have been\nfocused on analyzing the variability at the nucleotide level\n(SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms), as there are ro-\nbust algorithms to perform variant calling. However, TEs\ngenerate an important part of the genetic variability\npresent in a particular species. Moreover, the timing of oc-\ncurrence of TE and SNP mutations is different, as the\nformer can amplify in bursts generating a great amount of\ndiversity in short periods of time, whereas SNP mutation\nrates are more constant in time. Therefore, the identifica-\ntion of Transposon Insertion Polymorphisms (TIPs) is of\nhigh interest. Nevertheless, our capacity to accurately\nidentify TIPs using re-sequencing data is hampered by the\nstructural complexity of TEs.\nIn the last few years, many laboratories have developed\nbioinformatic tools to look for TIPs and have started to\nanalyze their impact in intra-species variability, including\ncrop plants [ 7, 10, 42]. There are two main approaches\nthat can be used to detect TIPs in whole-genome se-\nquence data: i) inference from discordant read-pair map-\npings, and ii) clustering of ‘split’ reads sharing common\nalignment junctions [ 2, 15]. Most of the recently devel-\noped tools incorporate both methodologies, and in some\ncases TIPs have been experimentally validated [ 27].\nMoreover, in some cases the authors have evaluated\ntheir sensitivity and precision (also known as positive\npredictive value) [ 11, 24]. However, in most cases these\nevaluations were performed by generating simulated in-\nsertions that are randomly placed in the genome, and\nthen used to compare with tool predictions. Simulated\ninsertions are far from representing the complexity of\n“natural” TIPs, as many of their features are difficult or\nimpossible to mimic accurately (i.e.: element degener-\nation, nested insertions, insertion preferences, etc.). As a\nconsequence, the benchmarks done with simulated data\ntend to overestimate performance of the tools analyzed\n[21]. An example of such benchmarks is the one re-\nported by the developers of McClintock, a pipeline that\nintegrates six tools [ 36] (Table 1). In their study, the au-\nthors provided a detailed comparison of their compo-\nnent’s performance in sensitivity and positional accuracy\nbased on simulated LTR-retrotransposon insertions,\nwhich also includes some real resequencing data, in the\nyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In spite of the interest of\nsuch comparative analysis, the direct translation of these\nresults to other eukaryotic models with bigger and more\nrepetitive genomes is uncertain. This is especially rele-\nvant as S. cerevisiae contains only 51 full LTR-\nretrotransposons in the whole genome [ 8], whereas in\nmost plant and animal genomes the LTR-\nretrotransposon load is several orders of magnitude\nhigher. Also, a recent study focused on simulated but\nalso real human AluY, L1 and SVA families revealed\nhuge differences in the ability of seven tools to detect\nTIPs [ 41]. In spite of the importance of these families\nfor human research, they do not represent the diversity\nof the TE landscape of other animals and plants, which\nis far more complex, with many families from different\norders being potentially active, and where the amount of\ntruncated non-autonomous elements greatly outnum-\nbers the active copies.\nIn plants, TEs are at the origin of important agronomic\ntraits, such as apical dominance in maize [ 45], the skin\nand flesh colors in grape [ 28] and blood oranges [ 4]. Dif-\nferent efforts have been made recently to identify TIPs\nthat could be responsible for important variability in\nplants. Carpentier et. al [7] screened the presence of 32\nrice LTR-retrotransposon families in the 3000-rice gen-\nome dataset and uncovered more than 50,000 TIPs, most\nof them occurring at a very low frequency, which is indi-\ncative of recent activity. Besides LTR-retrotransposons,\nMITEs are probably the most prevalent group of transpo-\nsons in plants, including rice, where they have experienced\nrecent massive amplification bursts [ 10, 35]. MITEs are\nstructurally very different from LTR-retrotransposons, as\nthey are non-autonomous, usually non-coding, and rela-\ntively small. They are of particular interest because they\ntend to integrate close to genes and may carry regulatory\ndomains [ 20], having the potential to create or rewire\nregulatory networks [ 12]. In the present study, we have\ntaken advantage of the existence of several high-quality as-\nsembled genomes of different rice varieties to create a vali-\ndated dataset of natural LTR-retrotransposon and MITE\ninsertions obtained by direct comparison between the as-\nsembled genomes (Nipponbare and MH63), that we have\nused to benchmark the performance of 12 TIP calling\ntools. Moreover, we have also analyzed the sensitivity of\nthe best performing tools to detect experimentally vali-\ndated TIPs in Drosophila and humans. Our results evi-\ndence that tool performance is in general lower than\nestimated by previous simulations, and highly variable de-\npending on sequencing coverage and TE type. Also, we\nshow that an appropriate combination of tools can in-\ncrease the sensitivity of predictions while maintaining high\nprecision levels.\nResults\nTools selected for benchmarking\nWe selected 12 of the most widely used tools for the de-\ntection of TIPs (Table 1). Among them, four were\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 2 of 19\nspecifically designed to detect non-reference insertions\n(not present in the reference genome) (RelocaTE2 [ 11],\nJitterbug [ 21], Retroseq [ 27] and ITIS [ 24]), and eight\nwere able to detect reference (present in the reference\ngenome) and non-reference insertions (MELT [ 18],\nPopoolation TE2 [ 29], Teflon [ 1], Trackposon [ 7], TEMP\n[48], TE-locate [ 37], Popoolation TE [ 30], and ngs_te_\nmapper [ 32]. Tools specifically designed to detect pres-\nence/absence of reference TE insertions in re-sequenced\ngenomes (i.e.: T-lex 3) [ 3] were not benchmarked here.\nIn addition to their different targets, some of the tools\nwere family-specific (meaning that they run with one TE\nfamily at a time only), whereas most of them are able to\ndetect insertions from all the families in the same run\n(broad-spectrum). Five out of the 12 tested tools were\nrun as components of McClintock, a pipeline that com-\nbines the use of several TIP detection tools and stan-\ndardizes their outputs into the commonly used BED\nformat (Table 1).\nThe first difficulty that the user has to face is properly\ninstalling and making the tools run, often in a computer\ncluster. This can be sometimes complex due to the num-\nber of different dependencies, and especially due to the\nspecificity of the input file preparation. In this regard,\nwe found that RelocaTE2, PopoolationTE2 and Trackpo-\nson were the less problematic tools (Table 1). One possi-\nbility that would make the installation of these tools\nmuch easier would be to have them integrated in an en-\nvironment such as Conda. This is a possibility that fu-\nture developers should take into account.\nLTR-retrotransposon and MITE landscape in Nipponbare\nand MH63 genomes\nIn order to perform a benchmarking exercise that could\nbe representative of as much as possible TIP detection\nin eukaryotes, we decided to use rice as a model as it\nhas a genome of 430 Mb, which is relatively large and\ncomplex in terms of TE landscape, and that has already\nbeen considered as being as close as possible to a repre-\nsentative genome for angiosperms [ 7]. Moreover, there\nare several good-quality assemblies and short-read data-\nsets of rice varieties available [ 23, 47].

Indeed,\nwhereas LTR-retrotransposons are relatively long ele-\nments (typically several Kb-long) and contain many\nstructural features relatively easy to detect (e.g.: long\nLTRs at their extremities, coding capacity for several\nwell conserved enzymatic activities), MITEs are short\n(typically 100 – 800 nt), are non-coding and do not con-\ntain structural features (except for short inverted-repeats\nin most cases) allowing for structural detection.\nWe used a combination of structural and\nhomology-based approaches to annotate a high-\nquality dataset of 3733 and 3787 full-length LTR-\nretrotransposons in Nipponbare and MH63 (Minghui\n63) assemblies, respectively (Table 2). These elements\ncontain intact Target Site Duplications (TSDs), Long\nTerminal Repeats as well as coding domains. All of\nthem were clustered at 80% similarity over 80%\nlength to obtain families and we derived a consensus\nfor each family. RepeatMasker was then run with\nsuch consensuses to identify all the LTR-\nretrotransposon copies of the genome (including frag-\nments and non-autonomous elements) related to the\ncharacterized families. A similar strategy was used to\nidentify ~ 46,000 full-length MITEs, as well as ~ 200,\n000 partial MITE copies (see methods section).\nWhereas full-length LTR-retrotransposons represent a\nvery small proportion of the total number of LTR-\nretrotransposon copies detected, (3%, Table 2), full-\nlength MITEs represent an important fraction (23%).\nThe distribution along the chromosomes of the two\ntransposon groups is also different, with LTR-\nretrotransposons being more abundant in the centro-\nmeric and pericentromeric regions and MITEs\npopulating evenly the rest of the chromosome\n(Fig. 1).\nAnnotation of standard transposon insertion datasets for\ntool benchmarking\nThe most straightforward way of identifying an insertion\npolymorphism “in silico ” when two high quality assem-\nbled genomes are available (as it is here the case), is by\naligning orthologous loci. To identify the Nipponbare\northologous loci to those that in MH63 contain a TE in-\nsertion, we mapped the flanking regions of each MH63\nfull-length LTR-retrotransposon and MITE insertion\nagainst the Nipponbare genome. As sequence diversity\nand structural differences between the two genomes may\ncomplicate this analysis, we tested different flanking se-\nquence lengths and found that 500 nt was the one that\nallow to identify more reference and non-reference in-\nsertions (Additional file 6: Figure S1). By inspecting the\ndistance between the two mapped flanks, we could as-\nsign the orthology status to the locus (ie, empty site or\nfull site). Using this approach, we were able to assign an\northology status to 86% of the MITE loci, but only to\n41% of the LTR-retrotransposons loci. This was probably\ndue to the difficulty to identify the orthologous loci of\ninsertions siting in repetitive sequences, which is much\nmore frequent for LTR-retrotransposons than for\nMITEs. Therefore, although this strategy seems the\nmore straightforward, it has clear limitations. Moreover,\nas defining the precise TE-genome junctions for non-full\nlength elements (ie, degenerated or partial elements,\nwhich are the vast majority of LTR-retrotransposons,\nTable 1) is challenging, we could not use this strategy to\nanalyze the possible polymorphisms arising from non-\nfull-length LTR-retrotransposons. To overcome those\nlimitations and increase the dataset of curated insertions,\nwe developed a strategy aimed at complementing the\nTIPs dataset with TIPs predicted with the 12 tools ana-\nlyzed here (Table 2), which were individually validated.\nTo this end we ran the different TIP-prediction tools\nusing MH63 paired-end reads mapped to the Nippon-\nbare reference genome. We divided the Nipponbare\ngenome in 500 nt windows and mapped the windows\ncontaining predicted insertions (red boxes, Fig. 2) to the\nMH63 genome. An inspection of the aligned sections\nallowed determining whether the predicted insertion\ncorresponded to a reference (shared) or non-reference\n(MH63 specific) insertion or if it should be considered a\nfalse positive (Fig. 2b). Indeed, in case of reference\n(shared) insertions, the Nipponbare and the correspond-\ning MH63 sequences would perfectly align, showing that\nthe sequence, which contains a TE insertion is\nconserved in both genomes (Fig. 2b, left); in case of a\nnon-reference (MH63 specific) insertion, the alignment\nwill be split by an insertion in the MH63 sequence cor-\nresponding to an annotated TE (Fig. 2b, right); and in\ncase where the two sequences show a continuous align-\nment in the absence of an annotated TE insertion in\nTable 2 Annotation of LTR-retrotransposons and MITEs in rice\nassemblies\nTE Classification Nipponbare MH63\nLTR-all a 131,905 117,362\nLTR full-length b 3733 3787\nLTR- Gypsy 1354 1303\nLTR- Copia 944 759\nLTR- Unclassified c 1435 1725\nMITE-all (1) 211,732 191,113\nMITE full-length d 45,963 46,725\na Repeatmasker fragments.

After running all tools,\nadjacent windows corresponding to TIP predictions of\nthe same category were merged to produce a final\ndataset. LTR-retrotransposon insertions are frequently\nmore complex than MITEs (i.e.: length, tendency to\nform nested insertions and extremely high amount of\ntruncated and degenerated elements, Table 2). Because\nof this, it was difficult in many cases to automatically\nvalidate the insertions. Therefore, manual inspection of\nthe alignments of LTR-retrotransposons TIPs was\nperformed, and we decided to restrict the dataset of\nLTR-retrotransposons to a single chromosome (chr5).\nThis strategy combined the power of detection of\nread-based methods (useful for uncovering polymor-\nphisms derived from both full and degenerated ele-\nments), with the reliability of the validation based on\nalignments between high-quality assembled genomes. By\nusing this combined approach, we increased the number\nof validated non-reference MITE insertions from 1898\nto 3117 whereas for LTR-retrotransposons (chr5) the\namount of non-reference insertions in our validated\n20\n0\n10\n10\n30\n0\n20\n30\nMITEs\nLTR- retrotransposons\nMITE full-length\nMITE RepeatMasker\nTeflon\nRetroseqTElocate\nPopoolationTE2\nrelocaTE2\nNon-ref.

The result was a high-quality dataset of True\nPositive (TP) and False Positive (FP) reference and non-\nreference insertions (Additional file 2: Table S1). In\naddition, there were predicted insertions that did not\nmatch neither with TP nor FP (i.e.: cases that did not fit\nin the scenarios described in Fig. 2b). We analyzed the\nspecific cases of unclassified non-reference insertions\nand found that 86% of these LTR-retrotransposon pre-\ndicted TIPs and 92% of such MITE TIPs overlapped\nwith other transposons annotated in the reference.\nThese cases were not used for downstream analyses, as\nmost tools specifically indicate in their manuals that they\ncannot properly detect nested insertions. In order to\nevaluate the performance of each tool, we intersected\nthe windows corresponding to the TE insertions pre-\ndicted by the tool (both reference and non-reference TE\ninsertions) with those of the curated dataset to identify\nTP and FP (Fig. 2b). Insertions present in the curated\ndataset of TE insertions that were not detected by the\nevaluated tool were counted as False Negatives (FN).\nMost of the tools analyzed here are able to detect\ninsertions from all the families in the same run (broad-\nspectrum). Some of these tools are able to detect refer-\nence and non-reference insertions, whereas others only\ndetect non-reference insertions. The programs use dif-\nferent strategies to identify these two types of insertions,\nand consequently we analyzed their performance\nseparately.\nDetection of reference insertions by broad-spectrum tools\nWe observed that whereas the precision detecting MITE\nand LTR-retrotransposon reference insertions was very\nhigh for both types of elements, the sensitivity levels of\nmost of the tools were much higher for MITEs (Fig. 3).\nFor MITEs, the sensitivity of most tools increased with\ncoverage and tended to stabilize at 20-40X coverage\n(Fig. 3a). Teflon had consistently the best sensitivity and\noverall performance (F1-score) in the detection of refer-\nence MITE insertions even at low coverage, reaching a\nsensitivity of 74% at 10X with an almost 100% precision\n(Fig. 3a). All tools showed precision levels higher than\n99% at all coverages, and all tools except ngs_te_mapper\nyielded a sensitivity higher than 60% at 40X (Fig. 3a,\nAdditional file 3: Table S2). By contrast, the sensitivity at\n5X was low in general, with Teflon being the only tool\nreaching more than 50% (Fig. 3a).\nRegarding the detection of reference LTR-\nretrotransposons, the general tool performance was\nmuch lower than for MITEs (Fig. 3b). In this case, TE-\nlocate reached the maximum sensitivity followed by\nTeflon and was only slightly higher than 50% (Fig. 3b),\nand the other tools remained below 40% sensitivity. The\nsensitivity of TE-locate was higher than 50% in all the\ncoverages, whereas in Teflon, PopoolationTE2 and Popoo-\nlationTE it increased with coverage (Fig. 3b). When we\nfocused only on the detection of full-length LTR-\nretrotransposons, the performance of all tools increased\nconsiderably, reaching a maximum sensitivity of 85.4%\n(Fig. 3c). TE-locate was again the best performer showing\na sensitivity over 80% for all the coverages. We excluded\nthe predictions of TEMP for reference insertions, as this\ntool is based on the detection of absences assuming the\npresence as default, which leads to an overestimation of\nthe number of insertions, especially at a very low\ncoverage.\nDetection of non-reference insertions by broad-spectrum\ntools\nAll the benchmarked tools are able to detect non-\nreference insertions, a task that is more challenging than\ndetecting reference insertions, as the former are not\npresent in the reference genome to which the reads are\nFig. 2 Individual validation of predicted insertions.

Precision was very different for\nMITE and LTR-retrotransposon predictions, showing a\ntendency to decrease at high coverage (Fig. 4). Regarding\nMITEs, Teflon was the best performer followed by\nPoPoolationTE2 and Retroseq (Fig. 4a). These tools\nreached a sensitivity close to 75% (up to 75.6% in 40X\ncoverage for Teflon), whereas the rest of the tools had a\nmuch lower sensitivity (Fig. 4a). The precision was very\nhigh (> 95%) for most tools with the exception of TE-\nlocate, which dropped from 92.5% in 5X to 75.6% in\n40X. All the tools improved their performance when the\ncoverage increased (except Jitterbug, which performed\nthe best at 20X), with PopoolationTE2 and Retroseq\nshowing the steepest increase, especially between 5X and\n20X (Fig. 4a).\nRegarding LTR-retrotransposons, PopoolationTE2\nachieved the highest sensitivity, reaching a maximum of\n88.5% at 40X (Fig. 4b). Nevertheless, these tools yielded\na high number of false positives, which translates into\nlow precision levels (Fig. 4b). In general, the precision\ndetecting LTR-retrotransposons with respect to MITEs\nwas much lower for all tools. Jitterbug was the only pro-\ngram with a moderate precision (> 75%) across all cover-\nage levels, although its sensitivity was low (maximum of\n32.7% at 40X) (Fig. 4b). According to the F1-score,\nPopoolationTE2 and Teflon were the best performers at\nlow coverages (5X-10X), whereas at higher coverages\nPopoolationTE2 and Jitterbug showed the best balance\nbetween sensitivity and precision (Fig. 4b). Differently to\nwhat we previously did for reference insertions, we did\nnot compute the performance of the tools using only\nfull-length LTR-retrotransposons because they represent\nonly a small fraction of the non-reference annotated\ninsertions.\nThe output of most tools contains information that\ncan be used for filtering the putative insertions to\nachieve more precise detection levels. We checked\nFig. 4 Performance of broad-spectrum tools in the detection of non-reference insertions of MITEs ( a) and LTR-retrotransposons ( b). Relocate2 on\nLTR-retrotransposons at 40X was killed after 5 days running with 8 CPUs and 64GB of RAM\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 8 of 19\ndifferent filters for each program looking for gains in\nprecision with a low cost in sensitivity. In some cases,\nsuch as Jitterbug, the precision was already very high,\nand the filtering was not needed. In others, the cost in\nsensitivity was too high and the filtering was not consid-\nered useful. For the two best-performing tools, Popoola-\ntionTE2 and Teflon, filtering did result in significative\ngains in precision without an excessive cost in sensitiv-\nity. For PopoolationTE2 we applied a zygosity filter of\n0.7 (based on the fraction of reads supporting the inser-\ntion) which led to a drop of sensitivity for both MITEs\n(from 76 to 63%) and LTR-retrotransposons detection\n(from 88 to 65%, Additional file 7: Figure S2), but with\nan increase of precision, which was particularly striking\nfor LTR-retrotransposons (from 28.9 to 91.9% at 40X).\nFor Teflon, a zygosity filter of 1 resulted in a drop of\nsensitivity for MITEs (from 78 to 61.5%) and LTR-\nretrotransposons (from 57.7 to 44.2%) but with import-\nant gain in precision for LTR-retrotransposons (from\n15.2 to 70.8%), which was not significative for MITEs\n(98.4 to 98.5%) (not shown). In summary, based on the\nF1-score, filtering by zygosity greatly improved the over-\nall performance of PopoolationTE2 and Teflon for LTR-\nretrotransposon detection, whereas the effect of this fil-\nter on MITEs detection was much less pronounced due\nto the already high precision of the unfiltered results.\nDetection of non-reference insertions by family-specific\ntools\nSome tools have been designed to look only for TIPs of\na single TE family instead of all families at the same time\n(i.e., ITIS, MELT and Trackposon). In order to analyze\nthe performance of such tools, we used the largest MITE\nand LTR-retrotransposon families, which contain 194\n(whole genome) and 22 (chr5) MH63-specific insertions,\nrespectively (Additional file 7: Table S1). The analysis of\nMITE TIPs showed that ITIS and MELT did not per-\nform well and displayed low sensitivity and overall F1-\nscore levels (Fig. 5a). By contrast, Trackposon performed\nwell, displaying up to 72.8% sensitivity with 93.1 preci-\nsion at 40X coverage. In line with the results found for\nbroad-spectrum tools, sensitivity in the detection of\nLTR-retrotransposons was strongly dependent on the\ncoverage. Trackposon and MELT showed moderate sen-\nsitivity levels at 40X (58.6 and 55.2%, respectively)\nwhereas ITIS reached a maximum of sensitivity of\n13.8%. Regarding precision, Trackposon was the best\nperformer with values ranging between 76.9 and 100%\n(Fig. 5b).\nOverlap between TIP prediction tools\nAs there is no tool showing 100% sensitivity, we asked\nwhether the predictions of the different tools were com-\nmon or specific for each tool. We evaluated the overlap\nof the detected non-reference true and false positives for\nthe five better performing tools for MITE or LTR-\nretrotransposon TIP predictions (40X), taking into ac-\ncount their sensitivity and precision. In spite of the dif-\nference in the amount of predictions between MITEs\nand LTR-retrotransposons, the results showed very\nsimilar trends: 54% of TP were detected only by one tool\nfor both MITE and LTR-retrotransposon insertions\n(Fig. 6). As expected, the FP detected were tool-specific\nin the vast majority of the cases (90.2% were detected by\nonly one tool for MITEs and 98% for LTR-\nretrotransposons). The number of insertions detected by\nall tools was very low (1.3% of all TIPs detected for\nMITEs and 1.4% for LTR-retrotransposons). These re-\nsults suggest that combining tools may increase the sen-\nsitivity of the TIP detection, although this may come\nwith the cost of decreasing precision, as false positives\nare highly tool-specific.\nCombining tools to improve sensitivity\nOur previous results suggest that a combination of tools\ncould be useful to increase the sensitivity in identifying\nnon-reference transposon insertions. To this end, we\ncombined the predictions of PopoolationTE2 (the overall\nbest performer) sequentially with up to four tools se-\nlected based on their sensitivity and/or precision levels.\nAs a general trend, the combination of tools led to\nhigher sensitivity levels, reaching more than 90% for\nboth MITEs and LTR-retrotransposons at 40X coverage\nwhen combining five different tools (Fig. 7). However,\nthe increase in sensitivity comes with a decrease in pre-\ncision, particularly clear for LTR-retrotransposons, that\napproaches 10% for 40X coverage when combining five\ndifferent tools. The results presented suggest that the\ncombination of two tools provided the best balance be-\ntween sensitivity and precision. Specifically, the combin-\nation of zygosity-filtered PopoolationTE2 and Teflon for\nMITEs reached 82.1% sensitivity and 97.4% precision at\n40X. Regarding LTR-retrotransposons, the combination\nof zygosity-filtered PopoolationTE2 and Jitterbug\nreached 75% sensitivity and 86.7% precision at 40X.\nAs already mentioned, McClintock is an available\npipeline that combines several tools. Therefore, we com-\npared the performance of the combination of tools here\nproposed with that of the McClintock pipeline, which\ncombines the use of Retroseq, TEMP, TE-locate, Popoo-\nlationTE and ngs_te_mapper (we excluded RelocaTE\nfrom the pipeline due to excessive running time). The\ncombination of tools here proposed (PopoolationTE2\nand Jitterbug for LTR-retrotransposon insertions and\nPoPoolationTE2 and Teflon for MITEs) yielded consist-\nently a better sensitivity and much better precision and\nF1-scores than McClintock at all coverages (especially in\nthe case of LTR-retrotransposons, Fig. 8). The most\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 9 of 19\nimportant differences were found in precision at inter-\nmediate and high coverages. As an example, for MITEs\nat 40X PopoolationTE2-Teflon had 97.4% precision\nwhereas McClintock had 83.8% (Fig. 8a). Regarding\nLTR-retrotransposons at 40X, PoPoolationTE2-Jitterbug\nprecision was 86.7%, whereas that of McClintock\ndropped to 9% (Fig. 8b).\nEvaluation of best-performing tools using Drosophila and\nhuman datasets\nIn order to evaluate whether the benchmarking results\nusing rice data could be extrapolated to data obtained\nfrom other species, we benchmarked the best performing\ntools (PoPoolationTE2, Teflon and Jitterbug) using PCR-\nvalidated TIPs from Drosophila and humans. The Dros-\nophila dataset consisted of 81 TIPs from ten Drosophila\nlines sequenced at an average coverage of 42X [ 22]. This\ndataset contained TIPs from 12 different transposon fam-\nilies, including retrotransposons (LTR and LINE) and cut-\nand-paste DNA transposons (TIR) experimentally vali-\ndated by Lerat et al. [ 31]M e r e n c i a n oe ta l .[33] and Ullas-\ntres et al. [ 46] (Additional file 4: Table S3). The human\ndataset consisted of 148 TIPs obtained from one human\nindividual at a coverage of 20X [ 44]. This dataset consisted\nof TIPs related to ALU, SVA and LINE-1 retroelements.\nIn the analysis of human insertions, we also included\nMELT, as it is the best-established tool for the detection\nof human TE polymorphisms. The detection levels of\nPoPoolationTE2 and Teflon in Drosophila were moder-\nately high (69.1% of the insertions, Table 3 and Additional\nfile 5: Table S4), and substantially higher than Jitterbug\n(44.4% of the insertions). Using the combination of the\nthree tools, we were able to detect 81.5% of the insertions.\nThese results are in high concordance with the sensitivity\nFig. 5 Performance of family-specific tools in the detection of non-reference insertions of MITEs ( a) and LTR-retrotransposons ( b). Trackposon was\nrun on 10 kb for LTR-retrotransposons windows as described in [ 7]\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 10 of 19\nlevels found using rice data with LTR-retrotransposons\nand MITEs, where PoPoolationTE2 and Teflon showed\nsuperior detection levels to Jitterbug (Fig. 4). Regarding\nthe human sample, MELT was the best tool identifying\nhomozygous insertions (97.8%, Table 4), whereas PoPoo-\nlationTE2 was the best detecting heterozygous insertions\n(88.2%). Taking into account both kind of insertions,\nPoPoolationTE2 outperformed MELT, displaying an aver-\nage detection level of 90.5%. The detection rate of these\ntwo programs was higher on human data than in Drosoph-\nila or rice, where sensitivity levels rarely exceeded 70%\nusing 20X coverage (Fig. 4). The detection levels of Jitter-\nbug were similar to those found using Drosophila and rice,\nranging from 47.8 to 51%. Teflon was unable to complete\nthe task and the process was killed after five running days.\nUsing the combination of tools, the detection rate in-\ncreased only 3.4% for the human dataset, reaching up to\n93.9% (Table 4).\nRunning time\nComputation time is a limiting factor when running TIP\ndetection tools in large datasets. Therefore, it is an im-\nportant criterion to take into consideration for selecting\nthe most appropriate tool for a specific experiment. We\ntested the time needed by the tools to finish the predic-\ntion with a 10X dataset and 432 MITE families as input.\nIt is important to mention that three tools (Trackposon,\nITIS and MELT) work on a per-family basis. In these\ncases, the reported time was that needed to finish the\nprediction for a single family. By contrast, the remaining\ntools work with all the annotated TE families at the\nsame time. According to our results, Trackposon was\nthe fastest tool, with only 1.7 CPU hours needed to fin-\nish (Fig. 9). Among the general tools, ngs_te_mapper,\nTE-locate and PoPoolationTE2 were the fastest tools,\nwith 8.6, 9.6 and 9.7 CPU hours needed to finish the\nprediction for the 432 families. RelocaTE2 took the\nFig. 6 Venn diagrams representing the detection overlap in non-reference true positives and false positives for MITEs and LTR-retrotransposons\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 11 of 19\nlargest amount of time to finish the prediction (59.1\nCPU hours) (Fig. 9).\nDiscussion\nThe use of real data is essential for an accurate\nbenchmarking of TE insertion detection tools\nThere are several tools available to detect TIPs from\nshort-read resequencing data, and some efforts have\nbeen made to validate the performance of such tools [ 36,\n41]. However, their benchmarking has been essentially\nbased on simulated TE insertions and simulated short\nreads. It is challenging to perfectly simulate sequencing\nerrors, local coverage variations, biases due to GC con-\ntent or other genome specific biases that real short-read\ndatasets contain. Similarly, the heterogeneity of real\ntransposon insertions, with polymorphic truncated or\ndegenerated elements and elements inserted in highly\nrepetitive regions, among other confounding effects, are\nalso difficult to simulate. As a consequence, the bench-\nmarking using simulated data may be overestimating the\nperformance of the TIP prediction tools. Indeed, our re-\nsults show that, most of the tools here analyzed have a\nlower sensitivity than previously reported. For example,\nRelocaTE2 and TEMP were previously benchmarked on\nsimulated rice data, and the sensitivity of both tools was\nestimated to be higher than 99% at 10X [ 11]. On the\ncontrary, our results using a dataset of real insertions\nand real short-read data show that both programs per-\nform very different, with TEMP having a maximum sen-\nsitivity of only 13.3% for MITE detection and\nFig. 7 Performance of tool combinations in the detection of non-reference insertions in MITEs ( a) and LTR-retrotransposons ( b)\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 12 of 19\nRelocateTE2 showing a 35.6% sensitivity. Similarly, we\npreviously reported a sensitivity of close to 90% for Jit-\nterbug, a program developed in our laboratory, using\nreal short reads on simulated TE insertions [ 21]. Our re-\nsults now show that for the dataset analyzed (real TIPs\nand real short reads) the maximal sensitivity is of 32.7%\n(Fig. 4, LTR-retrotransposons), although it does so with\na relatively high precision. Therefore, our results suggest\nthat the sensitivity and precision previously reported for\nTIPs detection tools, determined using simulated data,\nare probably overestimated and that the real perform-\nance of these tools is probably lower. We think that the\nperformance levels of the different tools presented here\nare a much better estimation of their detection ability on\nreal datasets. It is important to note, however, that de-\npending on the genome to be analyzed, parameters used\nTable 3 Number of insertions detected by PoPoolationTE2, Jitterbug and Teflon using a validated Drosophila melanogaster dataset\nRAL-737 RAL-40 RAL-801 RAL-802 RAL-850 RAL-502 RAL-508 RAL-491 RAL-235 RAL-21 TOTAL %\nValidated insertions 17 16 97457547 8 1\nPoPoolationTE2 12 5 95336535 5 6 69,1\nJitterbug 11 2 35224232 3 6 44,4\nTeflon 12 6 94345445 5 6 69,1\nCombination 15 6 97347546 6 6 81,5\nTotal number of insertions detected by each tool on each line is provided in Additional file 5: Table S4\nFig. 8 Performance comparison between McClintock pipeline and our proposed tool combinations for MITEs ( a) and LTR-retrotransposons ( b).\nPoPoolationTE2 and Teflon are filtered by zygosity as explained in the text (cutoffs of 0.7 and 1, respectively)\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 13 of 19\nand especially on the quality of the annotation of the ref-\nerence genome the performance of the programs may\nvary. All the programs benchmarked here are based on\nthe detection of discordant paired-end reads and/or\nsplit-reads at the junction of TE insertions. Among the\ndifferent confounding factors that can interfere with the\ndetection process, the quality of the TE annotation of\nthe reference genome and in particular of the proper\ndefinition of the TE-genome junctions, is an important\none. Therefore, it is important to work on refining the\nannotation of the TEs (or at least the more interesting\nTE families for the purpose of the study) before search-\ning for TIPs.\nTool performance varies depending on TE family\nEukaryote genomes contain a high diversity of TE ele-\nments with very different copy numbers and functional\nand structural characteristics, which may impact on the\nability of TIP detecting programs to reliably identify\ntheir insertions. Because of that, we decided to bench-\nmark the different programs using two very different\ntypes of TEs that, in addition, are the most prevalent in\nplants: MITEs and LTR-retrotransposons. The results\npresented here show that, as expected, the analyzed tools\ndo not detect different TE types with the same sensitivity\nand precision. MITEs and LTR-retrotransposons repre-\nsent extreme examples based on their length and com-\nplexity, and the performance of the tools when used\nwith other TEs will probably be in the range of this\ncase-study. The analysis of the sensitivity of the best per-\nforming tools in detecting TIPs produced by different\ntypes of transposons (including LINEs, LTR-\nretrotransposons and cut-and paste TIR transposons) in\nDrosophila and humans suggests that this is indeed the\ncase. Our results indicate that MITEs are detected with\nbetter sensitivity and precision than LTR-\nretrotransposons. The difference is especially relevant in\nthe detection of non-reference insertions, where most\ntools show low precision levels for LTR-\nretrotransposons. In the present study, we ran all sam-\nples in default mode or using the parameters described\nby the authors in the corresponding manuscripts or\nmanuals (Additional file 1). Nevertheless, we show that\nprecision can be increased by applying specific filters to\nthe results. For example, we show that, for some pro-\ngrams, LTR-retrotransposon detection can be drastically\nimproved by applying a zygosity filtering. Applying such\nfiltering may be a good strategy when not intending to\nstudy somatic insertions which should in most cases be\nheterozygous. The difficulties of detecting LTR-\nretrotransposons come from the complexity of the\nFig. 9 Running time of each tool to perform the detection of MITEs in a 10X dataset.

Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 14 of 19\nelements and from the local regions where they insert. It\nis known that LTR-retrotransposons (especially those of\nthe Gypsy superfamily) tend to integrate in heterochro-\nmatic regions enriched in other TEs. These repetitive re-\ngions are likely a source of false positives that affects all\nthe programs tested. These repetitive regions are, in fact,\ndifficult to annotate and polymorphisms within these re-\ngions may be challenging to detect even using long-read\ndata or when aligning good-quality assemblies. By con-\ntrast, MITEs tend to integrate close to genes [ 25] and\ntheir flanking regions are more likely to be unique in the\ngenome. The presence of non-repetitive TE flanks\ngreatly simplifies the detection of TIPs, as the probability\nof finding multimapping reads in these regions is\nminimal.\nAnother important consideration related to the differ-\nent TE families is the quality of the annotation. MITEs\nare easy to annotate and usually have well defined\nboundaries. By contrast, LTR-retrotransposons form\nnested insertions and are often degenerated. This makes\nvery difficult to accurately define their boundaries, and\nas a consequence many chimeric elements are usually\nannotated. As already mentioned, an accurate TE anno-\ntation is essential to increase the capacity of the tools to\nidentify TE insertions based on short-read data. In this\ncontext, it could be a good strategy to identify and re-\nmove chimeric transposons from the annotation prior to\nusing any of these tools (ie, when working with consen-\nsuses or with the actual annotation). A chimeric or\nnested transposon, for example an LTR-retrotransposon\nwith a MITE inserted inside, will be targeted by reads\narising from the two elements, and other MITE inser-\ntions of the same family present elsewhere in the gen-\nome could be wrongly identified as LTR-\nretrotransposons insertions by the TIP detection tools.\nInfluence of the type of genome on the performance of\nthe tools\nThe ability of any of the tools to detect TIPs depend on\nthe nature of the transposon insertion itself and its\nflanking genome sequence, and none of them can detect\nnew transposon insertions in repetitive regions. There-\nfore, in addition to the type of transposon generating the\nTIP, as already discussed, the performance of the tools\nmay depend on the genome under study. For this reason,\nwe have analyzed the sensitivity of the tools that per-\nformed the best using rice data on Drosophila and hu-\nman data and compared their performance on the\ndifferent datasets. The sensitivity of the different pro-\ngrams analyzed in Drosophila was very similar to the\none obtained in rice. As the genomes of rice and Dros-\nophila are relatively different, the former being much\nbigger (430 Mb vs 175 Mb) and with a higher content of\nrepetitive sequences (37% vs 20%), this suggests that the\nperformance of the tools is relatively independent of the\ngenome used, and that the benchmarking here presented\ncould be of use for TIP analysis in many different\nsystems.\nThis analysis also showed that the tools that per-\nformed best on rice had an even better sensitivity on hu-\nman data. The difference of sensitivity was particularly\nclear for PoPoolationTE2 and MELT. Although this\ncould indicate a difference of the performance of these\ntools in the two genomes, it could also be due to the\nparticular nature of the human dataset. Indeed, the data-\nset of validated TIPs in humans contains insertions from\nTE families (LINE-1, ALU, SVA) that were detected in\nthe first place using only one method, based on split-\nread and read-pair information [ 44] and therefore the\nsensitivity of the programs on this dataset could be over-\nestimated. It is worth mentioning that the PCR-validated\nDrosophila and human insertions have been predicted\nusing a small number of tools in the original publica-\ntions, and therefore it includes only a subset of all the\ninsertions present in these genomes. Moreover, the hu-\nman and Drosophila datasets were validated by PCR,\nwhich could have introduced a bias in the TEs that were\nincluded in these datasets. However, note that the num-\nber of families included in the human and Drosophila\nvalidation datasets are similar or bigger than the ones in-\ncluded in the rice dataset and contain both full-length\nand truncated TEs.\nSequencing coverage critically impacts TIP detection\nIndependently of the different performance found be-\ntween TE families, we found that coverage has a major\nimpact on tool performance for all the TE families\ntested. In general sensitivity increases with increasing\ncoverage. Therefore, homogenization of sample coverage\nis essential when using TIPs prediction tools to quantita-\ntively compare the transposition rates between organ-\nisms or populations. Some tools like PopoolationTE2\nhave internal steps to carry out this task. Nevertheless,\nfor qualitative studies coverage homogenization is dis-\ncouraged as down-sampling high-coverage datasets leads\nto a smaller number of detected insertions. It is import-\nant to note that the increase of sensitivity with increas-\ning coverage comes, in most cases, with a decrease in\nprecision. Therefore, depending on the goals of the study\na different level of coverage may be suitable. From the\ndata presented here it seems that a coverage below 20X\nis probably not suited for most analyses, as the probabil-\nity of missing true insertions is very high.\nStrategies to increase tool performance\nThe fact that an important fraction of the insertions de-\ntected by the different tools are not shared supports the\nfact that combining different tools may increase the\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 15 of 19\nquality of the results [ 36]. However, simply increasing\nthe number of tools does not necessarily increase the\nquality of predictions, due to the accumulation of tool-\nspecific false positives (ie, the combination of five tools\nyielded 95% of sensitivity but only 11.8% precision in\nnon-ref LTR-retrotransposon detection, Fig. 7). This is\ndue to the fact that whereas many true insertions are de-\ntected by several tools, most false positives are tool-\nspecific (Fig. 6). Combining a limited number of well-\nperforming tools may be the best approach. Indeed, our\nresults show that with the dataset used, the combination\nof PoPoolationTE2 and Jitterbug to detect LTR-\nretrotransposon insertions, or PoPoolationTE2 and Tef-\nlon to detect MITEs yielded superior TIP annotations\n(better F1-score) than the tools alone. Also, the perform-\nance of these tool combinations was better than that of\nthe McClintock pipeline, especially regarding LTR-\nretrotransposons. In this sense, we recommend combin-\ning tools based on their high precision and not only on\ntheir high sensitivity (ie, PoPoolationTE2 and Jitterbug).\nNevertheless, there can be situations in which sensitivity\nhas a priority over precision (ie, re-sequencing of a sin-\ngle individual, or interest only on a few families). In such\ncases, running more tools can be an alternative and\nmanual curation should be considered.\nSelecting the appropriate tools for detecting TE insertions\nin resequencing data\nDepending on the objective of the analysis, a family-\nspecific tool could be more interesting than a broad-\nspectrum tool. For example, when tracking the effect of\ncertain treatment in a concrete set of elements. Another\nimportant consideration is that the amount of storage\nneeded is smaller in comparison to broad-spectrum\ntools, due to the smaller size of the alignment files. For\nsuch cases, a tool such as Trackposon could be a good\noption due to its fast speed, moderate sensitivity and\nhigh precision. Nevertheless, as a drawback, Trackposon\ndoes not report the exact insertion point and, which\ncould be a limitation for some studies. In those cases,\nMELT can be an interesting alternative, although it re-\nquires adjusting family-specific parameters to produce\nhigh-quality results. This might be indeed the cause why\nMELT did not perform well on the detection of rice\nMITEs. In general, it is possible that the tools analyzed\nhere, which were not specifically designed for MITEs\nand LTR-retrotransposons, may work better for other\ntypes of TEs or with modifications in the parameters\nused. Based on our results, if the objective of the study is\nto analyze insertions of more than one family, and the\nstorage space is not a major limitation, using some of\nthe top broad-spectrum tools such as PoPoolationTE2 is\nprobably a better option as those programs can also be\nrelatively fast and show high sensitivity and precision in-\ndependently of the species and TE type analyzed.\nConclusions\nBesides the important efforts of tool developers, our re-\nsults suggest that the identification of TIPs is still chal-\nlenging. We propose here a number of approaches, such\nas combining tools, which can be followed depending on\nthe purpose of the study and the TE families to be ana-\nlyzed, that can provide good results. However, it is im-\nportant to note that in the best scenario (combining\noptimal tools at best coverage, Fig. 7) and having a good\nTE annotation of the reference genome, the sensitivity\ncould be around 70% with a precision of 80 – 90% for\nnon-reference insertions. These numbers may be enough\nfor most studies, but it is important to keep in mind that\nsome insertions will be missed, especially when estimat-\ning insertion frequencies or when using TIPs for GWAS,\nfor example. There are major limitations like the length\nof the reads that can be resolved with current technolo-\ngies (ie long-read sequencing) and will certainly improve\nin the following years. But there is still the need to de-\nvelop new algorithms specifically designed to identify\nTIPs from long reads, to generate highly curated TE an-\nnotations of reference genomes and also more independ-\nent benchmarks on real data to evaluate the\nperformance of tools under different conditions.\nMethods\nSequence data used\nWe used the available data for the japonica Nipponbare\n(GCA_000005425.2) and the indica MH63 (GCA_\n001623365.1) assemblies, and the short-read resequen-\ncing of MH63 (SRX1639978), which were used to gener-\nate the original assembly.\nMITE annotation\nMITE-hunter [ 19] was run on Nipponbare and MH63\nassemblies to detect MITEs families, which were then\ncombined with the high-quality predictions available in\nPMITE database [ 9] (only families carrying TSD). Clus-\ntering at 90% was performed to remove redundancy\nusing cd-hit [ 17] and produce a final library. RepeatMas-\nker ( http://www.repeatmasker.org/) was run to annotate\nall regions having significant homology with any of the\nMITE families. The annotations were further screened\nto discriminate full-length elements (consensus length ±\n20%) from truncated hits.\nLTR-retrotransposon annotation\nLTR-retrotransposons were identified by running\nLTRharvest [ 14] on IRGSP and MH63 assemblies with\ndefault parameters. The internal conserved domains of\nthese elements were obtained running hmmscan [ 13],\nVendrell-Mir et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:53 Page 16 of 19\nand only coding elements were retained for further ana-\nlyses. The identified elements were clustered with Silix\n[34] according to the 80 – 80 rule. All the elements in\neach family were aligned with Mafft [ 26] and trimmed\nwith Trimal [ 6]. Consensus sequences were built from\nthe alignments using the EMBOSS package [ 40].\nDetermination of benchmarking standards\nWe took advantage of the availability of two high quality\nrice genome assemblies (IRGSP and MH63, the former\nused as reference) in order to obtain a curated dataset of\nreal “reference” (orthologous) and “non-reference” (spe-\ncific to MH63) insertions as explained in Fig. 2. Mapping\nof reference and non-reference windows to MH63 gen-\nome was performed using BBmap ( https://sourceforge.\nnet/projects/bbmap/). Intersections between annotations\nwere done with BEDtools [ 38].\nDrosophila and human benchmarking datasets\nThe Drosophila dataset consisted of 81 TIPs from ten\nDrosophila lines sequenced at an average coverage of\n42X [ 22], and validated by PCR by Lerat et al. [ 31], Mer-\nenciano et al. [ 33] and Ullastres et al. [ 46] (Additional\nfile 4: Table S3). In Lerat et al. [ 31], TIPs were predicted\nusing TIDAL [ 39] and PoPoolationTE2 [ 29] using 14\nEuropean D. melanogaster pooled populations (average\ncoverage of 90X). Briefly, validated TIPs were present in\nthe DGRP population and at least in one European\npopulation at > 10% frequency, not present in the Y\nchromosome, and with a predicted length of < 6 kb to\navoid problems with PCR amplification. In Ullastres\net al. [ 46], TIPs were predicted by TIDAL in the DGRP\npopulation [ 39]. Validated TIPs were inserted in regions\nwith recombination rates > 0, and present in at least 15\nDGRP strains. Finally, in Merenciano et al. [ 33] TIPs\nwere also predicted by TIDAL in the DGRP population\n[39] and all belonged to the roo family. Both full-length\nand truncated copies were validated, as no TE length fil-\nter was applied.\nThe human dataset consisted of 148 TIPs obtained\nfrom a human individual (NA12891, SRA accession\nSRX207113) [ 44]. Original sequencing coverage of the\nhuman genome was down sampled to 20X.\nTIP prediction\nPredictions of transposon insertions were done using the\n12 tools shown in Table 2 using the default parameters\nand / or following the recommendations of the authors.\nThe scripts used for running each of the tools are shown\nin Additional file 1.\nEvaluation parameters\nWe used the following parameters for evaluating the\nability of each tool to detect MITEs and LTR-\nretrotransposons: True positives (TP): Insertions de-\ntected by any tool matching with our curated dataset of\nTPs. False positives (FP): Insertions detected by any tool\nmatching with our curated dataset of FPs. False nega-\ntives (FN): Insertions present in our curated dataset of\nTPs, not detected by the evaluated tool. These primary\nparameters were used for calculating the final bench-\nmarking ratios that have been previously used for asses-\nsing the performance of similar tools [ 41].\nSensitivity = TP/ (TP+ FN).\nPrecision = TP/ (TP + FP)\nF1-score = 2 x [(Precision x Sensitivity) / (Precision\n+ Sensitivity)]\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.\n1186/s13100-019-0197-9.\nAdditional file 1.
