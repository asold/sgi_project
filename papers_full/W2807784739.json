Introduction\nThe tooling system is an extremely important functional part of high-grade numerical-control (NC) machine tools.\nAs such, monitoring the running state of NC tooling systems is a key aspect of the NC system, and one that has a\ndecisive effect on the manufacturing process(Li et al., 2017). Therefore, as manufacturing processes continue to\ndevelop, it is essential that the tool state is monitored in real-time so as to provide a basis for warning operators of the\nneed for tool radius compensation and cutting parameter optimization(Kannatey-Asibu et al., 2017).As a result of such\naction, environmental pollution and processing costs can be reduced, and productivity and product quality improved\n(Ghanietal.,2011).\nMilling machines are more complicated than other mechanical machining methods for a variety of reasons: the\ndiverse nature of the milling conditions encountered, variability of the cutting parameters, random nature of tool wear,\nand complexity and incomplete controllability of the cutting process. There are also a large number of factors that\ninfluence the wear of the milling tool. Thus, monitoring models are faced with a great challenge: adaptability.\nSubsequently, adaptability modeling and extraction of wear features during milling are difficult to accomplish and\nconstitute bottleneckproblemsinresearch ontool-wear monitoring.\nAt present, obtaining satisfactory milling machine results is still primarily dependent on the skill and experience of\nthe workers. This strongly influences the stability of milling quality and delays the intelligentization and digitization of\nthe milling process.As a result, this problem has become one that needs to be solved urgently. In this context, studying\nthe theory, technology, and intelligentization of on-line monitoring of milling tool-wear is of great significance in\nrealizing precise control over the milling process and promoting intelligentization and digitization of mechanical\nmanufacturing. Moreover, it can greatly enrich the basic theory and methods used in intelligent milling machining.

It is also difficult to \nacquire large numbers of typically worn samples in practice. In this work, a method of predicting the wear of \nmilling tools is proposed based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the use of a support \nvector machine (SVM). The EEMD method is used to decompose the original non-stationary vibration \nacceleration signals into several stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMFs).

Indirect methods\ninvolve inferring tool wear indirectly by use of various sensors. This approach to identifying the state of tool wear is\none that has been accepted by scholars all over the world. Based on signal processing and analysis technology, these\nmethods extract features of the acquired signals (cutting force, vibration, acoustic emission, cutting temperature and\npower, etc.) using time domain, frequency domain, time–frequency domain, and time series analysis methods.\nMoreover, features that reflect tool wear can be used to make a multi-dimensional eigenvector. Then, mode\nidentification methodscanbeusedto studyand identifythestate oftoolwear.\nWang et al. (Wang et al., 2014) introduced heterogeneous ensemble learning to realize tool condition monitoring\nin which the support vector machine, hidden Markov model and radius basis function are selected as base classifiers\nand a stacking ensemble strategy is further used to reflect the relationship between the outputs of these base classifiers\nand tool wear states. Kilundu et al.( Bovic et al., 2011) used data mining technology in their tool-wear monitoring\nresearch while Chia, Liang, Yen et al. (Yen et al., 2013) monitored tool wear occurring during milling by using a\nself-organizing feature mapping neural network model. Qun, Ren et al. (Qun et al., 2010) integrated multi-sensor and\ntool wear information using Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy modeling and thus provided a highly-precise and\nhighly-reliable method of tool wear prediction. Tomas Kalvoda et al.( Tomas and Hwang, 2010) carried out research on\ntool wear monitoring using a method based on Hilbert–Huang transformation. Geramifar et al. (Geramifar et al.,2012)\nintroduced a method to continuously monitor the state of tool wear during milling by employing a hidden Markov\nmodel. Jun, Hong, Zhou et al.( Zhou et al.,2011) used features of the acoustic emission signal to identify tool wear\nusing an autoregressive integrated moving average model based on a few external features as input. Liu Lu etal. (Liu et\nal.,2011) automatically identified the tool wear state by employing a hypersphere SVM. Wang Guofeng et al. (Wang et\nal.,2011)analyzed multi-sensor information (e.g. multi-directional cutting force and vibration signal) and acquired\ninformation on time, frequency, and wavelet domains to use as features to classify wear. Nie Peng et al. (Nie and\nChen ,2011) established a system to predict tool wear based on PCA and an improved back propagation (BP) neural\nnetwork using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. Guan Shan(Guan,2011) proposed a method of multi-feature\nanalysis of acoustic emission signals based on LS-SVM which was aimed at classifying tool wear and predicting the\nextentofwear undera varietyofcuttingconditions.\nThe above discussion summarizes the various methods used to monitor wear. In the early stages, the methods were\nmainly aimed at analysis in the time domain. In the middle stages, they moved more towards time–frequency analysis\nand employed Fourier transformations. In more recent years, wavelet analysis and neural networks have begun to\nfeature. It is apparent, therefore, that developments in signal processing technology have positively affected the\npromotion of tool wear prediction. Todate, however, no good methods have been found to predict the state of tool wear\nduring milling. The reasons for this are two-fold: Firstly, changes in the cutting parameters affect the stability of the\nsignal processing technology during milling. Secondly, the monitoring signals observed during milling exhibit strong\nnon-linearity and non-stationarity.This causes the frequency-domain features of the signals to vary with time and so the\nmillingsignals cannotbedescribed using fixed frequency-domainfeatures.\nThe signal frequency after FFT is mixed, so it can not identify from high frequency signal and the high frequency\nnoise. The wavelet transform maps the signal into the wavelet domain and divides the signal scale at the same time, so\nthe details are concerned from the internal signal. The disadvantage is that wavelet transformation need to determine\nthe wavelet base also threshold and hierarchical number according to the different characteristics of the object, and the\nselection ofthe parameters hasa greatinfluence onthe filtering accuracy,that is,The wavelettransformis non adaptive.\nThe empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method can decompose the signal adaptively according to different\nfrequencies, and achieve noise reduction by component high pass, low pass, band pass or threshold filtering. But when\nthe high frequency signal denoising, there is modal aliasing, which affects the filtering effect of non-stationary signals\nthis includes abnormal events. In order to solve the modal aliasing problem, the ensemble mean empirical mode\ndecomposition is proposed. The EEMD method makes use of the zero mean value of Gauss white noise and the\nuniform distribution characteristics of the frequency to make the signal feature scale evenly distributed and the\nabnormal events can be processed smoothly.Thus the high frequency denoising effect of the EMD is better than that of\nthe high frequency denoising, and the processing process is adaptive and the wavelet filtering is simple. The EEMD\nmethod can obtain a complete and accurate time-frequency distribution of the signal energy, which has higher accuracy\nand resolution than the traditional FFT spectrum, and does not produce energy leakage at the same time. When the tool\n2\n2\n© 2018 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.2018jamdsm0059]\nXu, Chai, Li and Shi, Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, V ol.12, No.2 (2018)\nis worn, the natural frequency of the cutting system will be changed. At this time, the energy of the tool wear signal\nwillchange inthe naturalfrequency section.\nEmpirical mode decomposition (EMD), however, is a newly developed signal-processing method thatis suitable\nfor non-linear and non-stationary signals. EMD is a method of time–frequency analysis that was proposed by Huang in\n1998. The EMD method involves decomposing a signal into the sum of numerous intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)\nbased on the timescales of the local features of the signal (Huang et al.,1998). As EMD is a local method of\ntime–frequency analysis which uses an adaptive basis, it avoids the effects associated with poor decomposition which\ngenerally occur due to improper choice of basis function during wavelet decomposition. Moreover, each of the\ndecomposed IMFs represent information specific to a certain frequency-band and have specific significance. This\nfavors the extraction of weak abnormal information from the signal. However,as a result of the fitting of envelope lines\nand mean-value curves, the zero-mean problem and end effects of the algorithm mean that the IMF components\nobtained using EMD from the measured signals lack physical significance in mechanical failure applications. This has\na heavy impact on the application of EMD processing in signal analysis. This is especially the case when the timescales\nof the signals decomposed via EMD exhibit ‘jumpy’ changes. As a result, IMF components containing features of\ndifferenttimescalesarelikely tooccur,thatis, we end upwith modalmixtures,(Pengetal.,2005and Chenetal.,2014).\nTo solve this problem, Wu et al. proposed the use of EEMD. Using EEMD, a non-stationary signal can be\ndecomposed into a finite number of approximately stationary IMFs. Of crucial importance is that the degree of modal\nmixing in the IMFs obtained via EEMD is lower than that via EMD (Wuand Huang,2004,2009).The signal energies in\ndifferent frequency bands change when tools become worn. Therefore, the state of wear can be identified by calculating\nthe EEMD energy entropy of the different vibration signals (Yang and Shao,2013). On this basis, a new method of\npredicting the wear of milling tools based on EEMD and SVM is proposed in this study. In the method, the energy\nfeatures extracted from the IMF components that contain primary information on tool wear are regarded as the input to\ntheSVM to identifythestate ofthe toolwear.\n2. Experimental materials and procedures\n2.1 Workpiece materials\n0Cr18Ni9 stainless steel with high strength, good rigidity, strong corrosion resistance, good wear resistance, low\nprice and excellent comprehensive performance, and is widely used in aerospace, chemical, petroleum, building and\nfood in all walks of life, which has extensive application. 0Cr18Ni9 stainless steel is a material that is typically difficult\nto machine: it shows a high tenacity and thermal intensity as well as a low thermal conductivity. Furthermore, it is\nliable to undergo significant plastic deformation, severe work hardening, and generates much heat during cutting, and\nthe heat is hard to dissipated, so the tool tip operates at a high temperature and chips are liable to adhere to the cutting\nedges. As a result, built-up edges are easily to produce, so as to accelerate tool wear . In view of the wide application of\n0Cr18Ni9 stainless steel and its difficult to process particularity, 0Cr18Ni9 stainless steel is chosen as the experimental\nobject.\nIn the experiment, 0Cr18Ni9 stainless steel square stock with a length, width, and height of 420 mm, 320mm, and\n100 mm respectively was used. The mechanical properties were as follows: tensile strength b 520MPa  , yield\nstrength 0.2 205MPa  , elongation rate 40%  , area reduction % 60 , elastic modulusE > 115 GPa, and a\nhardnessof159HB.Inaddition,the chemicalcomponentsarelistedinTable1.\nTable1 Themassfraction ofthe componentof0Cr18Ni9stainlesssteel\nEelement C Mn Mo Co P Cr Ni Cu N2\nMassfraction 0.02 1.71 2.10 0.12 0.03 16.31 10.14 0.24 0.04\n2.2 Cutting tool materials and geometrical parameters\nTiAlN_ carbide tool with 10 μm of composite coating produced by Lamina Company, Switzerland was used to\nprocess the 0Cr18Ni9 stainless steel. In addition, it had two teeth and the types of arbor and insert were 90W25-3K13\nand APMT 1135 PDTR LT30 respectively. The geometrical parameters of the insert were as follows: front angle 9°,\nback angle 16°, inclination angle 4°, minor back angle 17°, end-cutting edge angle 4°, corner radius 0.5 mm, and\ncutting edge angle 90°afterinstallingainsert(see Figure1).Thediameter ofthe toolusedin theexperimentsis 16mm.\n3\n2\n© 2018 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.2018jamdsm0059]\nXu, Chai, Li and Shi, Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, V ol.12, No.2 (2018)\nFig.1 Thetoolarborand insertused intheexperiment\n2.3 Cutting experiments\nCutting experiments were conducted on an NC milling machine (type XKA 714) and the cutting rate adjusted by\nchanging the spindle speed. During the experiments, the vibrations in thex, y, andz directions were measured by using\na DH5922N testing system.Amicroscope with a super-high depth of field (Smartzoom 5) was employed to observe the\nwear mode and measure the extent of wear of the flank. The vibration acceleration test system used is illustrated in\nFig. 2. The acceleration transducer is located on the workpiece.In our experiments, the peripheral milling and radial\ncutting depthswere both2mm, and theaccelerationsampling frequency wassetto10kHz (indrycutting mode).\nFig.2 Millingand vibrationaccelerationtestsystem\nCutting conditions were chosen according to an orthogonal experiment table. Under the conditions determined, the\nexperimentsproceededasfollows:\n1)Two blades were installed on the cutter bar for the cutting experiments and a single-cutting length of 420 mm\nwas chosen. Cutting was continuously performed 5 times using NC programming. The vibrational signals were\ncollectedduring cuttingand thenthecutter barand bladesweretakendown.\n2)Theextentofwearofthe cutter flank, VB,wasmeasured.\n3)The cutter bar and blades were reinstalled and then the NC milling machine was turned on. Cutting was\ncontinuously performed 5 times under the control of the NC programmer. The cutting process was continued until a\nreasonable amount of wear had been caused to the blades ( 0.3mmVB  ). In this context, the cutting experiment for\nthissetofconditionswasended.\n4)Another set of cutting conditions were chosen and then steps 1–3 repeated. When all the different cutting\nconditionshad beencompleted,theexperimentwasended.\nIn the experiments made using the same cutting conditions, the new blades used last for some time before they\nreach a certain amount of wear (which is consistent with what happens in actual cutting jobs). Tool wear is a process\nthat only varies gradually. Hence, only the experimental data obtained in the last 3 s of each cutting process will truly\nreflect the state of tool wear corresponding to the measuredVB. This greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to\nbe analyzed and makes subsequent data processing much more convenient. A method that cutting time is gradually\nincreased is used in each cutting experiment to facilitate the calibration of cutting time. The wear on the tools was\nmeasured usingthefollowing procedure:\n1)The tool shank and positions of tool bits 1 and 2 were marked.Ablack spot was marked where the generatrix of\nthe shank was vertical to the normal of the primary tool flank.An infrared (IR) emitter was fixed onto the Smartzoom 5\nso that IR ray emitted was parallel to the normal of the primary tool flank and coincided with the black spot (Figs. 3a\nand 3b).\n2)To guarantee that different tools were in the same position under the lens, a white rectangular block was pasted\nonto the display screen. During each observation process, the end of the tool bit was checked to ensure that it coincided\nwith theblock(Fig. 3c).\n4\n2\n© 2018 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.2018jamdsm0059]\nXu, Chai, Li and Shi, Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, V ol.12, No.2 (2018)\n3)To ensure the same measuring position was used, the coordinate system in the Smartzoom 5 was employed (the\ncoordinate system was determined according to special points in the tool image taken before wear was incurred). The\ntool nose was taken as the origin. A distance equal to two-thirds of the cutting depth used in the experiment was\nmeasured along the blade line. Then, the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the point corresponding to this\ntwo-thirds depth were ascertained.The straight line passing through this horizontal coordinate was employed as the line\nused to monitor the tool wear. Clearly, the tool nose could not be determined once the tool had started to wear.\nTherefore, the tool root was used as the standard location to which the relative amount of tool wear was recorded.\nSubsequently,allthecoordinates usedwererecordedand usedtocalculate the degree oftoolwear(Figs.3dand 3e).\n4)Pictures were taken of the tools after putting them into the set reference position. Using the coordinates\ndetermined before wear started, the wear-monitoring line could be obtained from the tool image. The initial wear point\non the line was manually moved to the bottom edge of the tool wear area and the vertical coordinate recorded. The\nextent of tool wear could then be acquired by finding the difference between the vertical coordinates before and after\nthemovement.Finally,thedata wasrecorded(Fig. 3f).\n5)The extent of tool wear grows with time (i.e. the wear value measured each time is larger than that previously\nmeasured). Thus, any decline in the extent of wear suggests that errors are present in the experimental results (this may\nbe caused by various uncertain factors, e.g. local non-uniformity in the tool texture, inaccurate monitoring of the wear\nline, etc.). Therefore, the whole of the wear area was analyzed macroscopically during data acquisition to help\neliminate (as far as possible) the effects of accidental factors on the experimental data. In addition, measurements were\nconducted three times in order to avoid errors during the measurement process. These measurements were then\naveragedand themeantaken astheextentofwearofthe toolflank.\nFig.3 Thetoolwear offline measurement\nExperiments were conducted using orthogonal experiments based on three factors at four levels (the experimental\nvariables include the cutting ratev , feed per tooth f , and cutting depth pa ).

The wear mode and variation in the extent of wearVB with cutting lengthL is shown in Figs. 4 and 5\n( min / m 100v , mm/tooth 05 . 0f , and mm 3p a ). Fig. 4 shows that when the stainless steel (0Cr18Ni9) was\nmilled, wear primarily occurred to the rake face, flank, and boundary. Also, multi-mode wear probably appears\nsimultaneously due to the complex nature of the cutting process.As stainless steel is a hard material to machine, serious\nfriction occurs between the rake face and sheared metal, as well as between the flank and machined surface.As a result,\nhigh contactpressure andtemperature isgeneratedwhichcauses the rake face,flank,and boundaryofthe tooltowear.\nFig.4 The wearmode andvariation intheextentofthe flank face wear VB withcutting lengthL ( min / m 100v ,\nmm/tooth 05 . 0f ,and mm 3p a )\nFig. 5 displays the change in the extent of wear (VB) of the tool flank with cutting length (L).The wear process in\nmilling tools can be divided into three stages: primary, normal, and dramatic. In the primary wear stage (0–3 m), the\nwear rate is rapid. When the extent of wear increases to 0.1 mm, the wear rate declines to a small value. We then enter\nthe normal wear stage (3–30 m), during which the extent of wear slowly grows from 0.1 to 0.3 mm.

Fig. 5 shows that the extent of wear of\ntwo tool flanks which were started simultaneously vary in the same way with cutting length. The samples used in the\nsubsequent analysis were extracted based on the overall change in tool wear. The tool wear can be divided into six\nstates,accordingtotheextentofwearofthe toolflanks (Table 4).\nTable4 Wearstatesofthe toolflanks\nStates Extentofwear/mm State number\n1 10 . 0 0 VB 1VB\n2 15 . 0 10 . 0 VB 2VB\n3 20 . 0 15 . 0 VB 3VB\n4 25 . 0 20 . 0 VB 4VB\n5 30 . 0 25 . 0 VB 5VB\n6 VB30 . 0 6VB\n3. EEMD and feature extraction\n3.1 The EEMD method\nThe EEMD method reduces the degree of modal mixing by adding white noise to the recorded signal.This is done\nso that the signal exhibits a certain continuity on different scales based on the statistical nature (uniformly distributed\nfrequency) of the Gaussian white noise.

The signal can be decomposed into 13 IMF components and one residual\ncomponent using the EMD method, as shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from this figure that the non-stationary vibration\nacceleration signal arising from the tool’s wear state is decomposed into a finite number of stationary IMF components\nbytheEMDmethod. Inaddition, the differentIMFcomponentscorrespond todifferenttimescales.\nFig. 8 shows the decomposition results obtained under the same conditions using EEMD. It can be seen from a\ncomparison of Figs. 8 and 7 that the latter has a lower degree of modal mixing when the amplitudes change in the same\nrange. Obviously, if there is basically no difference in the waves while the amplitude range varies, then the degree of\nmodal mixing with the smaller change in amplitude range is less than that with larger changes. Thus, it can be\nconcludedthatthe degree ofmodalmixing usingEEMDislower thanthatfound usingEMD.\n3.2 Sensitive IMFs extraction\nThe next step is to identify the most sensitive IMFs. As well as information on the state of tool wear, the original\nvibrational signals also contain various irrelevant information (state of the machine, etc.) and background noise. The\noriginal signals have been decomposed into a series of IMF components representing the intrinsic signals using EEMD.\nBy eliminating the IMFs containing noise and information irrelevant to the wear state of the tool, we can improve the\naccuracy with which the tool wear is identified. Depending on the characteristics of the tool-wear-induced vibrational\nsignals, the stepsinvolvedinthisprocessareasfollows:\n1)Signal preprocessing: Apart from useful information, the vibrational signals collected from the experimental\ntool-wear identification process also contain much interference. The signals tend to exhibit troublesome characteristics\nincluding non-linearity, non-stationarity, and lack smoothness. They therefore deviate from ideal (true) behavior which\ncauses errors and even mistakes to be made in the subsequent analysis. Therefore, the preprocessing of the vibrational\nsignals isa veryimportantpartoftheiranalysis.\n8\n2\n© 2018 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.2018jamdsm0059]\nXu, Chai, Li and Shi, Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, V ol.12, No.2 (2018)\nFig.7ThedecompositionresultsusingEMD\nThe noise present can be reduced using a nonlinear method of wavelet thresholding. Generally speaking, after\nwavelet transformation, the wavelet coefficients with large amplitudes mainly correspond to genuine signals, while\nthose of low amplitude are primarily noise. The threshold noise-reduction method refers to when noisy signals are\nprocessed via wavelet decomposition and then a threshold used to discard the information related to noise. Wavelets\nwhose coefficients are larger than the set threshold are retained and those that are not have their coefficient set to zero.\nThe processed wavelet coefficients can then be used to reconstruct the (noise-reduced) signal. The white noise in the\nsignal can completely constrained by using the threshold method. The threshold value employed is generally calculated\nusing one of four methods: rigrsure, heursure, sqtwolog, or minimax. The most suitable thresholds to use to reduce\nnoise in the data used to determine tool wear are based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For threshold selection, there\nare 4 threshold selection rules: rigrsure, heursure, sqtwolog, and minimax. When choosing threshold to reduce noise,\nthere is always a contradiction between noise removal and retention of high frequency components of useful\nsignals.The rigrsure rule is an adaptive threshold selection based on Stein's unbiased likelihood estimation principle.\nGiven a threshold lambda  j , its likelihood estimate is obtained, and then the likelihood j is minimized to\nobtain the selected threshold. This is a software threshold estimate.Sqtwolog is a fixed threshold form. It produces a\n9\n2\n© 2018 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.2018jamdsm0059]\nXu, Chai, Li and Shi, Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, V ol.12, No.2 (2018)\nthreshold of  .The best predictor variable threshold is chosen by heursure. If the signal-to-noise ratio is very small,\nthe signal processed by the unbiased likelihood estimation principle has very large noise, and this threshold type is\nneeded.Minimax uses the maximum and minimum principle to generate the threshold, and uses the minimum mean\nsquare error as the objective function to produce an extremum instead of no error. It is a threshold selection method\nbased on the statistical extremum estimator principle. This threshold estimator minimizes the maximum mean square\nerrorinagivenfunction(Suand Jun,2008).\nFig.8 The decompositionresultsobtained underthe same conditionsusingEEMD\n2)Calculation of correlation coefficients: The correlation coefficients between the IMF components and original\nsignalaredetermined according to(Nieetal.,2012):\n \n   \n   \n   \n2\n1\n2\n1\n1, cov\n  \n \n\n\n\nn\ni\ni\nn\ni\ni\ni\nn\ni\ni\ny y x x\ny y x x\nY D X D\nY Xr (5)\nwhere   Y X, covis the covariance between two sequences X and Y whose variances are D(X) and D(Y),\n10\n2\n© 2018 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.2018jamdsm0059]\nXu, Chai, Li and Shi, Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, V ol.12, No.2 (2018)\nrespectively.\n3)The correlation coefficient n between  t x and  t cs is calculated.

IMFs that\nreproduce many features of the vibration signal  t xwill be similar to the signal itself and have large correlation\ncoefficients. Therefore, the correlation coefficients (n ) can be considered as factors that can be used to evaluate the\nsensitivity of the IMFs. The signal  t xf of the machine tool operating without load is taken as reference. The\ncorrelation coefficients n between  t xf and vibration signal  t x are calculated to evaluate the non-wear\ninformation that is irrelevant to tool wear and contained in the IMFs of the signal t x. As well as the similarity\nbetween the IMFs and signal itself, the calculation of the IMF sensitive factors also takes the similarity between the\nIMFs and non-wear signals into account. Therefore, the selection algorithm for the sensitive IMFs can enrich the\ninformation regarding the potential components relating to tool wear, and reduce the information of the machine tool\nunder no-loadoperationthatisirrelevantto wear,soastoobtainmore distinct wear features.\n3.3 Calculation of IMF energy and energy entropy\nThe frequency distribution of the vibrational signal changes when the tool is in a state of wear. As a result, the\nenergy distribution of the vibrational signal also undergoes corresponding changes in the worn state. The vibration\nacceleration signal containing information on tool wear is decomposed into a group of IMF components using EEMD\nand thentheenergy iE ofeachIMFcomponentiscalculated(Xia etal.,2014).\n  dt t c Ei i\n2\n Mi 3 , 2 , 1 (8)\nThe energyvectorofthe IMFsisthenobtained.\n nE E E E T3 2 1, ,\nThe above vectorsarenormalized soastoobtainthefollowing result.\n np p p p T3 2 1, ,\nE E pi i/\n\n\nn\ni\niE E\n1\nBasedonthis,thedefinitionofEEMDenergyentropyisacquired(Yangetal.,2006).\n \n\nn\ni\ni iEN p pH\n1\nlg (9)\nThe quantity ip refers to the normalization energy of each IMF component and represents the weight of each\nIMF in the total wear energy.

Principles of LS-SVM\nLS-SVM is a method that improves on the traditional SVM method. In LS-SVM, inequality constraints appearing\nin traditional SVM are transformed into equality constraints, and the square error and loss function are considered to be\nthe empirical loss of the training set. In this way, a quadratic programming problem is converted into a problem\ninvolving the solution of a set of linear equations. This makes solution of the problem faster and improves convergence\nprecision.The basic idea of the LS-SVM classification algorithm is to transform the input space to a higher space using\na non-linear transformation defined by a kernel function in order to make the samples linearly separable. The optimal\nclassification face is constructed in the higher space to form the rule used to perform sample classification. The basic\nLS-SVM theory is mainly used to deal with two-class classification problems. Multi-class classification problems, are\ntransformed into two-class ones by using combined classifiers according to the basic idea of the LS-SVM. Moreover,\none of two modes are used in the combined classifier: one-to-one (as employed in this study) and one-to-many.All the\npossible two-class classifiers are constructed in theN training samples using the algorithm (so that there areN (N–1) 2\nLS-SVM sub-classifiers). In addition, the two-class classifiers are combined and the voting method is used to choose\ntheclasswith maximum votesastheclassofpointstobemeasured.\nLS-SVM algorithm:We are given a training sample  nl\nii i R y x1， , where l\ni R x and R yi  refer to the\ninput and output of the training sample, respectively. The objective optimization function in the LS-SVM algorithm is\n(Dai,2011):\n  \n\n  \nl\ni\ncMin\n1\n2\n2\n1   \n      b xi l i， ，1\nwhere,  x ,  ,  , b and c represent the mapping function of the kernel space, weight vector, error\nvariable, offset value, and adjustable parameter, respectively.Tofind the minimum value of the optimization function, a\nLagrange functionisestablished.\n     ii\nl\ni\ni\nl\ni\ny b xcMin        \n\n      \n11\n2\n2\n1\n(10)\nwhere, i refers to Lagrangian multiplier.

The constraints are also converted to equalities\nwhichgreatly reducesthe complexityoftheproblem.\n5.

The degree of tool wear was such\nthat the measuredVB value changed only slightly if 420 mm per feed was used to generate the data used to determine\ntool wear. Thus, 2100 mm (that is, cutting 420 mm for 5 times) was used. The changes associated with 2100 mm\n(cutting length) are considered to satisfy a linear relation. Table 5 displays the correlation found between the denoised\nsignals (using four wavelet bases) and the original signals, and the SNRs. The table indicates that there are good\ncorrelations and high SNRs after implementing noise reduction using the heursure and rigrsure wavelet bases.\nTherefore, the heursure wavelet basis was used to reduce the noise in the rest of this study. Fig. 10 shows the vibration\nsignals obtained fromthe cuttingtoolsthathave beendenoised usingtheheursure waveletbasis.\nTable5 Thecorrelation foundbetween the denoisedsignals (usingfourwavelet bases)\nand the originalsignals,andthe SNRs\nHeursure Rigrsure Sqtwolog Minimax\nR 0.9950 0.9950 0.9526 0.9720\nSNR 19.15 19.15 8.86 11.21\n2)EEMD\nEach signal was decomposed using the EEMD method to obtain a finite number of IMF components.The different\nsignals produce different numbers of IMF components and so the firstM IMFs containing wear information were\ntaken to use as research objects. The correlation coefficients and wear-sensitive factors were calculated according to\nEqs. (5)–(7), Determining the IMF component closely related to the original signal and contain the primary\ninformation of the original signal. The other IMF components are poorly correlated with the original signal and\ncontain noise from the original signal. Therefore, the other IMFs are abandoned to achieve signal denoising,\ndimension reduction, and normalization. vibration of high frequency component is likely to occur.If the high\nfrequency component in the IMF component is the multiple of milling the intermittent period of spindle,\nconsiderationis causedbyintermittentvibration.\nThe correlation coefficients and wear-sensitive factors were calculated according to Eqs. (5)–(7), as shown in\nFig.11. In Fig.11. n , n , n and n represent the correlation coefficient between t xand  t cs , the correlation\ncoefficient n between  t cs and the signal  t xf , the total correlation coefficient and the wear-sensitive factors,\nrespectively.n meansthatthecollected signalscanbedecomposedbyEEMDand get n IMFcomponents.\nIt can be seen from the Fig.11 that the first four IMF components exhibit a favorable correlation with the original\nsignal and contain the primary information of the original signal. The other IMF components are poorly correlated with\nthe original signal and contain noise from the original signal. Therefore, the other IMFs are abandoned to achieve\nsignal denoising, dimension reduction, and normalization. Fig. 12 displays the IMF sensitive factors calculated using\nthe sensitivity algorithm and shows them displayed in descending order. It can be seen that the maximum difference\noccurs between 2c and 3c . Thus, 1c and 2c for the first two IMFs are regarded as the wear-sensitive factors, and\nare used to construct the energy of the tool-wear signal. The selection algorithm has effectively selected the IMFs\nrelevant to tool wear and can thus highlight the characteristics of the tool wear. In order to strengthen the dispersion\nfeatures of the different energies of each vibration signal under different tool wear states, however, the first four IMF\ncomponentsare adoptedtocalculate the energyentropies.\n13\n2\n© 2018 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.2018jamdsm0059]\nXu, Chai, Li and Shi, Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, V ol.12, No.2 (2018)\n3)Calculationofenergiesand energyentropiesofthe firstfourIMFs\nThe percentage energies of the first four IMFs of the tool-wear vibration data collected in experiment No. 7 (under\nthe sixth state) were calculated according to the methods introduced in Eqs. (8) and (9). The results are shown in\nFig. 13. It can be seen from the figure that the energy distributions corresponding to different extents of wear change\nafter EEMD decomposition. That is, the percentage energy gives a good indication of the state of wear of the tools and\nfully exhibits the disparities between selected eigenvalues. Fig. 14 displays the eigenvalues of the data from different\ngroups under the same state (0.01<VB<0.02).The eigenvalues exhibit the same trends. That is, the selected eigenvalues\nhave favorable repeatability. Only those eigenvalues with favorable disparities and repeatability can result in accurate\nidentification. Therefore, these two points determine the quality of the selected eigenvalues.

The LS-SVMs based on Gaussian RBF can efficiently identify the state of tool wear in the\ntest samples. This shows that our method based on EEMD energy entropy and use of LS-SVM is an effective one to\nidentify the tool-wear state.At the same time, the recognition rate of the6VB sample is the lowest in Table 9 because\nof the edge gap emerged easily and the rapid wear of the cutting tool in the dramatic wear stage. The samples collected\nare less, and the amount of wear is distributed among the 0.30-0.35mm, and the coverage of the sample is narrow,\nwhich leads to insufficient training. It affects the overall recognition rate. However, the error identification of such\nsamples doesnotaffecttheperformance ofthe tool.\n6. Conclusions\nThe vibrational signals from milling tools subject to wear were processed using an EEMD method to explore\nthe energies of the principal components that contain information about the state of tool wear. The energies obtained\nwere normalized to generate energy eigenvectors to use as input to an LS-SVM for training and testing purposes. The\nfollowing conclusionscanbemade aftercomparing thepredictionsmadeusingthree differentfunctions:\n1)EEMD is a self-adaptive signal processing method which can be used to precisely process non-linear and\nnon-stationary signals.The degree ofmodalmixingusing EEMDislower than thatachieved usingtheEMDmethod.\n2)The energies of the signals in the different frequency bands change when the tools are worn. Hence, the state of\nthe tool wear can be identified by calculating the EEMD energies and energy entropies of the different vibrational\nsignals.\n3)The correlation coefficients between each IMF component and original signal can be calculated and sensitive\nIMFs chosen according to wear-sensitive factors. Moreover, the tool-wear state can be successfully identified by\ncombining the energy features extracted from the wear-sensitive IMFs containing primary tool-wear information with\ntheLS-SVM.\n4)The predictions made using an LS-SVM based on EEMD method are more accurate than those made using FFT,\nWaveletanalysisandEMDmethods.\nThisprojectissupportedbyNational NaturalScienceFoundation ofChina (GrantNo.51465029).The authors\nthanktoGansu province university collaborativeinnovationteam constructionplanfortheir support(GrantNo.\n2016C-07)andLanzhou talentinnovationand entrepreneurshipProject(GrantNo.2015-RC-4).\nBovic, K., Pierre, D. and Xavier, C.,Tool wear monitoring by machine learning techniques and singular spectrum\nanalysis,MechanicalSystems and SignalProcessing, Vol.25,No.1(2011),pp.400-415.\nChen, H.
