    "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient approach for developing three-phase transformer admittance matrices in the radial power-flow analysis. The proposed transformer model overcomes the singularity problem of the nodal admittance submatrices of ungrounded transformer configurations. This has been achieved by applying symmetrical components modeling. The classical (6 × 6) transformer nodal admittance matrix written in phase components is converted to sequence components instead of the (3 × 3) admittance submatrices. In this model, the phase shifts accompanied with special transformer connections are included in the radial power-flow solution process without any convergence problems. The final model of the transformer is represented by a generalized power-flow equation written in phase components. The developed equation is applicable for all transformer connections. The transformer model is integrated into the radial power-flow and tested using the IEEE radial feeders. The results have shown that the developed transformer model is very efficient and the radial power-flow has robust convergence characteristics.",
