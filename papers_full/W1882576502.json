With the advance of next-generation sequencing technology, many\nindel calling tools have been developed; however, evaluation and comparison of these tools using large-scale real data\nare still scant. Here we evaluated seven popular and publicly available indel calling tools, GATK Unified Genotyper,\nVarScan, Pindel, SAMtools, Dindel, GTAK HaplotypeCaller, and Platypus, using 78 human genome low-coverage data\nfrom the 1000 Genomes project.\nResults: Comparing indels called by these tools with a known set of indels, we found that Platypus outperforms other\ntools. In addition, a high percentage of known indels still remain undetected and the number of common indels called\nby all seven tools is very low.\nConclusion: All these findings indicate the necessity of improving the existing tools or developing new algorithms to\nachieve reliable and consistent indel calling results.\nKeywords: Indel calling, Variant calling, HaplotypeCaller, Next-generation sequencing, Deep sequencing, Software\nevaluation\nIntroduction\nInsertion and deletion (indel), is a common form of poly-\nmorphism corresponding to the addition or removal of\nbase pairs in the DNA sequence of an organism. Indels\nhave been recognized as the second most abundant source\nof genetic variation in human populations [1 –3]. Studies\nhave shown that in the human body, 16 to 25 % of all se-\nquence polymorphisms are indels [4]. Furthermore, indels\nhave been identified to play a key role in causing diseases.\nFor example, cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disease, is\nfrequently caused by deletion of three nucleotides in the\ncoding region of the CFTR gene [5]. Diseases such as fra-\ngile X syndrome [6], trinucleotide repeat disorders [7],\nMendelian disorders [8], Bloom syndrome [9], acute mye-\nloid leukemia [10 –12], and lung cancer [13] are often\ncaused by short repeats/insertions in the DNA sequence.\nMoreover, insertion of transposable elements such as Alu,\nL1, and SVA can interrupt gene function and cause dis-\neases like hemophilia, neurofibromatosis, muscular dys-\ntrophy, and cancer [14]. In addition, indels can also\nchange gene expression by altering phasing and spacing of\nDNA sequences in the promoter regions [15]. For\nexample, a small insertion of 5 bps can rotate the binding\nsite to the opposite face of the DNA helix, whereas a long\ninsertion of 100 bps can increase the spacing between two\nbinding sites [3]. Therefore, indels in the promoter regions\nmight explain certain difference in gene expression ob-\nserved in humans [15] and can be used as genetic markers\nin natural populations [16]. Since indels influence human\ntraits and diseases, detection of indels in a reliable manner\nis a prerequisite to develop effective treatment and medi-\ncine [17, 18].\nIn recent time, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has\nbecome more convenient because of its high efficiency, im-\nproved sensitivity of different sequencing platforms, and re-\nduced cost as compared to Sanger sequencing [19, 20]. By\napplying NGS in a large scale, whole genome sequencing\n(WGS) is now possible at an individual level [21 –23] and it\nhas revealed a significant number of structural variants that\nwere not reported previously. Since indels can alter human\ntraits and cause diseases, the result of indel calling from in-\ndividual WGS can be used to predict the future health of* Correspondence: lqzhang@vt.edu\n1Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2015 Hasan et al.

Alignment-based methods firstly map the reads\nto the reference sequence using read mapping software\nsuch as BWA [24] and Novoalign [25], and then call indels\nusing the alignment data by applying some filtering steps to\nseparate true indels from common sequence alignment er-\nrors (Fig. 1 (A)). In Fig. 1 (A), “True Call ” refers to the\nindels that passed after the filters are applied to separate\nindels from sequence alignment errors. Therefore, “False\nCalls” are those variants which are probably not indels but\ncaused due to the alignment er rors. Many indel calling\ntools belong to this category including Dindel [26], Stampy\n[27], SAMtools [28], Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK\nUnified Genotyper) [29], and VarScan [30, 31]. The main\ndifference among these tool s is in the model they use to\ndistinguish true indel calls from alignment errors. Some use\nthe Bayesian probabilistic model (GATK Unified Genoty-\nper, SAMtools, and Dindel), whereas others (VarScan) use\nthe heuristic approach. Split read mapping methods, on the\no t h e rh a n d ,f i r s t l yi d e n t i f yd i scordant paired-end reads for\nwhich one end maps completely to the reference sequence\nand the other end does not. The unmapped ends of these\nreads are then clustered or aligned by de novo assembly to\ndetermine indels (Fig. 1 (B)). Tools in this category include\nPindel [32] that uses a patte rn growth approach to detect\nbreakpoints of indels, and SV-M [33] that performs a dis-\ncriminative classification based on features of split read\nalignment profiles and then filters the result against\nempirically derived training s et data to reduce the false-\npositive rate. Paired-end read mapping methods compare\nthe expected distance to the actual mapped distance to de-\ntermine whether there is any indel in the sequence (Fig. 1\n(C)). Tools belonging to this category include PEMer [34],\nHydra [35], and BreakDancer [36]. Haplotype-based\nmethods first identify the regions of interest where the\nreads show substantial evidence of having indels relative to\nthe reference sequence. These regions are also known as\nactive regions. For each active region, the callers build a De\nBruijn graph to reassemble the active regions and yield the\npossible haplotypes present in the reads. After that, each\nread is realigned to the possible haplotypes and the likeli-\nhood of the haplotypes are calculated given the read data.\nLater, Baye’s rule or EM algorithms are applied to calculate\nthe posterior probabilities, and indels are called where the\nposterior probability exceeds a certain threshold value. In\naddition to that, some other filters are also applied to pro-\nduce a fine-grained result. GATK HaplotypeCaller [37] and\nPlatypus [38] belong to this category. Figure 1 (D) shows\nthe general overview of the haplotype-based indel callers.\nDespite many indel calling tools, evaluation of the tools\nobjectively, particularly using large-scale real data, is sparse.\nThere is an evaluation of four indel (Dindel, VarScan,\nGATK Unified Genotyper, and SAMtools) tools done by\nNeuman et al.; however, it was based on simulated data\n[39]. Instead of repeating the same experiment, here we\nperformed the evaluation of the tools as well as three\nadditional tools and we use real data to get the actual\ninsight. In this study, we investigated seven indel calling\ntools, GATK Unified Genotyper [29], VarScan [30], Pindel\n[32], SAMtools [28], Dindel [26], GATK HaplotypeCaller\n[37], and Platypus [38], using 78 human genome data from\ndifferent populations in the 1000 Genomes project. All\nthese tools are publicly available and are commonly used\nf o rb e n c h m a r k i n g .A n o t h e rr e ason for choosing these tools\nis that GATK Unified Genotyper, VarScan, SAMtools,\nDindel, GATK HaplotypeCaller, and Platypus can deal with\nshort indels (<50 bps), wher eas Pindel can call medium to\nlarge indels ranging from 50 to 10,000 bps. Therefore,\naltogether they cover indels of various lengths. Among\nthese seven tools, four of them (GATK Unified Genotyper,\nVarScan, SAMtools, and Dindel) fall into the alignment-\nbased method category, one ( Pindel) implements the split\nread mapping method, and two (GATK HaplotypeCaller\nand Platypus) are haplotype-based methods. We did not\nconsider tools that are based on paired-end read mapping\nbecause in most cases, they are insensitive to small indels,\nmaking it difficult to separate small perturbations in read\npair distance from the normal background variability [40].\nMoreover, the exact inserted or deleted sequence cannot be\nknown from the results of tools that belong to this category\n[ 4 0 ] .W ea l s on o t et h a to n l yo n eo ft h et w oc o m m o n l yu s e d\ntools (Pindel and SV-M) from the split read mapping\nmethod category was included in this study. We did not\nconsider SV-M mainly because this tool does not use BAM\nfile as input. As described in the README file of SV-M,\nthe input file requires the start and end position of each\nchromosome along with several features corresponding to\nthat chromosome such as the number of uniquely mapped\nreads (UMRs) overlapping the d eletion candidate, single\nposition variation (SPV) from split read alignment, and\nnumber of split reads supporting the same indel location.\nFor reason of consistency and to eliminate possible factors\nthat could bias the comparison, we decide to exclude SV-M\nfrom this study.\nMethods\nTools investigated\nWe investigated seven indel calling tools, GATK Unified\nGenotyper, VarScan, Pindel, SAMtools, Dindel, GATK\nHaplotypeCaller, and Platypus. A brief introduction of\neach tool and the commands for execution are provided\nbelow.\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 2 of 14\nFig. 1 Categories of indel calling tools.

Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 3 of 14\nGATK Unified Genotyper (GATK_UG) [29] (version 2.7)\nis a tool developed by the Broad Institute of MIT and\nHarvard. For indel calling, it incorporates realistic read\nmapping error and base miscall models. Using a Bayesian\ngenotype likelihood model, GATK_UG estimates the most\nlikely genotypes and allele frequency in the sample while\nemitting an accurate posterior probability of having a\nsegregating variant allele at each locus. We called indels by\nGATK_UG for each sample using the following command\nwith default settings:\nVarScan [30] (version 2.2.2) is a platform-independent\nsoftware tool developed by the Genome Institute of\nWashington University. It uses the mpileup file generated\nby SAMtools [28] for scoring and sorting sequence\nalignments. The reads mapped uniquely to one location in\nthe reference sequence are kept, whereas the unmapped\nand ambiguous mapped reads are discarded. The uniquely\nmapped reads are further fil trated on read depth, base\nquality, and variant allele frequency in downstream analysis\nand then used to call indels by a heuristic approach. Indels\nwere called by VarScan with its default settings using the\nfollowing commands:\nGenerating the mpileup file using SAMtools:\nCalling indel from the mpileup file:\nPindel [32] (version 0.2.4) is a pattern growth\napproach-based tool that detects breakpoints of large\ndeletions, medium-sized insertions, and other structural\nvariants from NGS data at single-based resolution. In\nPindel, all reads are initially mapped to the reference\ngenome. The mapping results are then inspected to select\npaired reads that are mapped with indels or have only one\nend mapped. Based on the mapped reads, Pindel\ndetermines the anchor point on the reference genome as\nwell as the direction of unmapped reads or the reads\nmapped with indels. Using this information and user-\ndefined maximum deletion size, a sub-region in the\nreference genome is located where the unmapped reads\nare broken into fragments and then the fragments are\nmapped separately. Pindel was executed with its default\nsettings using the following commands:\nThe configuration file:\nHere 250 is the insert size, i.e., the length of the region\nbetween the paired-end adapters in paired-end sequence.\nGenerating the output file:\nCreating the VCF file from the output file:\nSAMtools [28] (version 0.1.19) is a software package\nused for parsing and manipulating alignments in SAM/\nBAM format. For indel calling, it uses a Bayesian model\nfor local realignment and base quality assessment. We\ncalled indels by SAMtools with its default settings using\nthe following command:\nGenerating the mpile file:\nCalling indel from the mpileup file:\nDindel [26] (version 1.01), developed by the Well-\ncome Trust Sanger Institute in UK, is a software tool\nthat uses Bayesian network for calling indels from NGS\ndata. First, a number of candidate haplotypes, each con-\ntaining at least 120 bps, are generated according to the\nhypothesis that indel events exist in pre-specified\ngenomic segments. After realigning all reads to the can-\ndidate haplotypes using a hidden Markov model, the\nposterior probability of a haplotype is calculated using\nthe Bayesian approach and used to determine the pres-\nence of indels in the sample. Dindel assumes that all\ndifferences between the read and the candidate haplo-\ntype are caused by sequencing errors. By realigning\nreads to the candidate haplotype, it separates the indels\nfrom sequencing errors. Dindel uses mapping quality as\nthe prior probability that a read should align to any of\nthe candidate haplotypes, and thus, it effectively reduces\nthe weight of reads that cannot be confidently mapped to\nthat location in the genome. We used Dindel with default\nsettings to call indels by the following commands:\nStep 1: Extract candidate indels from the alignment file.\nStep 2: Create realignment windows.\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 4 of 14\nStep 3: For every window, generate candidate haplo-\ntypes from the candidate indels and realign the reads to\nthese candidate haplotypes.\nFor each file created in step 2\nStep 4: Create the final output.\nMerging results from all realignment windows:\nGATK HaplotypeCaller (GATK_HC) [37] (version\n3.30) is a tool developed by the Broad Institute of MIT\nand Harvard. For indel calling, at first it determines the\nregions of the genome where there are significant\nevidences of variation. Therefore, regions that do not\nshow any variation beyond the expected levels of\nbackground noise are skipped. After this step, the result-\ning regions having significant evidence of variations are\npassed to the next step. These regions are known as\n“Active Regions. ” For each active region, in the second\nstep, GATK_HC builds a De Bruijn graph to reassemble\nthe active regions and identifies the candidate haplotypes\npresent in the reads of the given sample. Additionally,\neach haplotype is locally realigned to the reference\nhaplotype to identify the potentially variant sites. In the\nnext step, for each active region, each read is then\npairwise aligned to each of the candidate haplotype\nusing the PairHMM algorithm. This produces a matrix\nof likelihoods of haplotypes for the reads in the given\nsample. These likelihoods are then marginalized to\nobtain the likelihoods of the alleles per read for each\npotentially variant site. For each potentially variant site,\nin the next step, Baye ’s rule is applied to determine the\nposterior likelihoods of each genotype per sample using\nthe likelihoods of alleles obtained in the previous step.\nThe most likely genotype is then assigned to the given\nsample. We called indels using GATK_HC with default\nsettings using the following command:\nPlatypus [38] (version 0.7.9.1) is a haplotype-based\nvariant calling tool developed by the Wellcome Trust\nSanger Institute in UK. In this tool, at the beginning,\ncandidate variants are obtained from read alignments,\nlocal assembly, and external sources, and then candidate\nhaplotypes are formed. After haplotypes are generated\nfrom candidate variants, their frequencies are estimated\non the basis of their likelihood. These likelihoods are\ncalculated by aligning a read to the haplotype sequence\nwith an underlying hidden Markov model (HMM). The\nforward algorithm is used to calculate the likelihood of a\nread given haplotype. After the likelihood is calculated\nfor all combinations of reads and haplotypes, an EM\nalgorithm is used to estimate the frequency of each\nhaplotype under a diploid genotype model. In the next\nstep, the posterior support for any variant is computed\nby comparing the likelihood of the data given all haplo-\ntypes and the likelihood given only those haplotypes that\ndo not include a particular variant. Later, indels are\ncalled when their posterior support exceeds a threshold\nusing these frequencies as a prior. The variants are also\nfiltered based on allele bias, strand bias, mapping quality,\nquality over depth, posterior quality, and sequence\ncontext. We called indel with the default settings of\nPlatypus using the following command:\nDataset\nThe dataset consists of low-coverage (~3X to ~12X)\nalignment profiles from 78 humans that belong to 26\npopulations and were collected for the 1000 Genomes\nproject [41]. We used the alignment files of chromosome\n11 as input for the tools we investigated. These short\nreads were sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer\nplatform [42] and mapped using BWA [24]. We used\nhs37d5 as the human reference genome, which is an\nextended version of the Build37 dataset of the 1000\nGenomes project with additional sequences. Note that\nthis reference genome was used by the 1000 Genomes\nproject in the final phase. Additional file 1: Table S1 lists\nthe samples we used with their corresponding ethnic\nbackground and coverage.\nIdeally, a benchmarking dataset for evaluating indel\ncalling tools would consist of a list of known indels for\nthe samples. However, such kind of benchmarking\ndataset is not available in large quantity [43]. Hence, for\nevaluation purpose, we used the indels identified in Mills\net al. [43] as the gold standard. To call indels, Mills et al.\n[43] examined 98 million Applied Biosystems (Sanger)\nDNA re-sequencing traces from the trace archive of\nNCBI which has been proved to be sufficient for accur-\nate indel calling [4]. After some pre-processing of the\ntraces based on the quality scores, they were compared to\nthe human reference genome to call indels. Details about\nthe indel calling procedure and some post processing to\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 5 of 14\ngenerate the gold standard dataset can be found in\n[4]. The called indels were validated using PCR-based\nmethodologies, and the va lidation rate was 97.2 %.\nThis dataset reports almost two million small and large\nindels found in all 24 chromosomes of 79 diverse humans\nwith length ranging from 1 to 10,000 bps. Moreover, it has\nbeen confirmed that the sequence traces used in Mills\net al. provide excellent coverage of the human genome\n[43]. Note that the samples we used here are sequenced\non Illumina Genome Analyzer platform and the indels\nlisted in the “gold standard ” dataset are called using the\nApplied Biosystem (Sanger) DNA re-sequencing traces. In\nspite of these differences, the indels identified in the gold\nstandard dataset are considered to be most likely reliable,\nand they have been used as the gold standard in other\nstudies [44, 45]. In Mills et al. [43], 58,811 indels were\nidentified for chromosome 11, and in the current study,\nwe used this set as the gold standard. Note that we did\nnot use simulated data for benchmarking because though\nsimulated data are valuable, they do not always represent\nthe actual phenomena. We could also use the sample\nbenchmark dataset available in “Genome in a Bottle Con-\nsortium” [46], but that one relies on a single dataset from\none human only (NA12878).\nEvaluation criteria\nWe evaluated the tools using the criteria including\nrunning time, number of indels called, comparison with\nthe set of gold standard indels, similarity among the\ntools, hierarchical clustering, and ranking of the tools.\nFor each sample, we executed the tools and re-\ncorded the number of indels called by each tool as\nwell as the running time. To see the relation between\nrunning time and coverage of the read, besides the\nlow-coverage samples, we also included the sample\nNA12878 with ~64X coverage. All analyses were done\non a Linux machine with Intel Core i7-2600 CPU @\n3.40 GHz * 8 processors, 16 GB RAM and Ubuntu 12.04\nLTS operating system.\nIndels called by the seven tools were compared with\nthose identified in Mills et al. [43]. From this compari-\nson, we calculated the corresponding recall and preci-\nsion for each of the tools using formulas (1) and (2).\nRecall ¼ TP\nTP þ FN ð1Þ\nPrecision ¼ TP\nTP þ FP ð2Þ\nFor comparing the accuracy of the tools, we used\nF-measure, the harmonic mean of the precision and\nrecall, where an F-measure reaches its best value at 1\nand worst score at 0. The F-measure was calculated\nusing formula (3).\nF‐measure ¼ 2 /C2 Recall /C2 Precision\nRecall þ Precision ð3Þ\nNote that the position of an indel with respect to the\nreference sequence sometimes cannot be defined unam-\nbiguously by a single coordinate [20, 47]. As shown in\nFig. 2, the insertion of a guanine into the local sequence\nof TiGi +1 Gi +2 Ci +3 after position i produces the same\nmutated sequence as inserting guanine after position i +\n1o r i + 2. Hence, these insertions have identical bio-\nlogical meaning, and therefore, an unambiguous annota-\ntion for this insertion should list all equivalent indel\npositions, i.e., + G {i, i +1 , i + 2} [20]. For this reason,\nwhile comparing an indel called by each tool with the\nindel in position i in the gold standard data, we treated\nthe indel called by the tool as true positive if it is within\nthe range of i ± 5 positions.\nBased on the indel calling results, these tools were\nranked in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\nspace [48], where the X and Y axes are denoted by\nfalse-positive rate (FPR) and true-positive rate (TPR),\nFig. 2 Example of identical indels taking place in relative positions. (Adapted from Krawitz et al. [20])\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 6 of 14\nrespectively. Here TPR is equivalent to recall and FPR is\nsimply (1 − precision) as calculated using formulas (1) and\n(2). In the ROC space, each point represents the prediction\nresult or instance of a confusion matrix. The diagonal ( Y =\nX) that divides the ROC space represents the decision from\na “Random Guess. ” Points above the diagonal represent\ngood classification results, whereas points below the line\nrepresent poor results. For each sample, we first calculated\nthe TPR and FPR for each tool and plotted as a point in\nthe ROC space, then ranked the tools based on the perpen-\ndicular distance of each point from the diagonal.\nWe also examined the similarity among the results\nproduced by different tools. Jaccard index, also known\nas Jaccard similarity coefficient, is used to compare the\nsimilarity between indel predictions. For two finite sets\nA and B, the Jaccard index can be calculated using\nJA ; BðÞ ¼ A∩Bjj\nA∪Bjj ; 0≤ JA ; BðÞ ≤ 1: ð4Þ\nThe maximum value of the Jaccard index is 1 when\ntwo indel sets are the same, whereas the minimum is 0\nwhen two indel sets are completely different.\nAnother interesting question to ask is “how are the\nseven indel calling tools related to one another on the\nwhole”? To answer this question, we clustered the tools\nusing the following three steps: (1) Divide the reference\nsequence into windows of equal size. We tested with\ndifferent window sizes (1000, 10,000, 100,000, and\n1,000,000 bps) and found that the window size does not\naffect the clustering result. For computational conveni-\nence, we set the window size to 1,000,000 bps. (2) For\neach window, calculate the number of indels called by\neach tool. (3) Construct a vector of indel counts of all\nwindows for each tool and apply the UPGMA hierarch-\nical clustering algorithm to the seven vectors.\nResults\nRunning time\nWe compared the tools on the average running time\ntaken to call indels for a sample. Table 1 shows the\naverage running time for samples with low coverage\n(average coverage ~6X) and high coverage (~64X). For\nboth high- and low-coverage data, Platypus is the fastest\nand Dindel is the slowest of all the tools investigated.\nClearly, indel calling is more time consuming for high-\ncoverage data than for low-coverage data, which is\nespecially evident for Dindel due to its complicated\nmodel for realignment. Since Dindel tests all indels\nidentified by the read mapper, many of which might be\nsequencing errors, with the increase of number of reads\nand increase in sequencing errors, the computation time\nincreases quadratically [26].\nNumber of indels called\nFigure 3 shows the number of indels called by each tool\nfor each sample. The seven tools under consideration\ncall different numbers of indels. The numbers of indels\ncalled across the 78 samples range from 1431 to 15,585\nfor GATK_UG, from 114 to 10,619 for VarScan, from\n1845 to 11,455 for Pindel, from 9351 to 20,245 for SAM-\ntools, from 9864 to 19,876 for Dindel, from 10,915 to\n24,786 for GATK_HC, and from 15,062 to 34,600 for\nPlatypus. On average, Platypus calls the maximum num-\nber of indels (average number = 23,321), whereas VarS-\ncan calls the minimum (2,775). The average number of\nindels called by SAMtools (14,719) follows closely to that\nby Dindel across the samples. Similarly, the average num-\nbers of indels called by GATK_UG (6733) and Pindel\n(6382) are very similar to each other across the samples.\nAs we can see from these results, VarScan is evidently the\nmost conservative one in calling indels. It calls much\nfewer indels than others. This might be due to its rather\nstringent filtering step during which all the unmapped and\nambiguous reads are discarded. Although this step is help-\nful in keeping the false positives down, it also reduces the\npower of detecting true indels.\nThe lengths of indels called\nWe examined the distributions of lengths of indels called\nby the seven tools and compared them to that of the\ngold standard dataset. All the indel distributions based\nTable 1 Average running time spent in calling indels for samples with low/high coverage\nTool Time\nLow Coverage (~6X) High Coverage (~64X)\nGATK_UG 16 minutes 43 seconds 24 minutes 19 seconds\nVarScan 16 minutes 1 second 84 minutes 02 seconds\nPindel 25 minutes 36 seconds 139 minutes 09 seconds\nSAMtools 11 minutes 26 seconds 64 minutes 14 seconds\nDindel 165 minutes 22 seconds 1549 minutes 18 seconds\nGATK_HC 58 minutes 27 seconds 91 minutes 13 seconds\nPlatypus 3 minutes 36 seconds 5 minutes 59 seconds\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 7 of 14\non lengths are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1\nwhich shows that 96.2 % of the indels in the benchmark\ndataset are 1 –10 bps, 98.6 % in GATK_UG, 99.0 % in\nVarScan, 93.4 % in Pindel, 92.2 % in SAMtools, 95.1 %\nin Dindel, 94.01 % in GATK_HC, and 97.19 % in\nPlatypus. Therefore, most of the indels in the benchmark\nand the ones called by the tools are ≤10 bps. Chi-square\nstatistical tests show that the distributions of indel sizes\nare not significantly different between the calling results\nof the tools and the gold standard ( p values for compar-\ning the gold standard with GATK_UG, VarScan, Pindel,\nSAMtools, Dindel, GATK_HC, and Platypus are 0.89,\n0.81, 0.96, 0.28, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively). Note\nthat Pindel is known for calling medium to large indels,\nbut here most of the indels called by Pindel are small\nindels.\nRegardless of the gold standard indels, we are interested\nto see the similarity/dissimilarity of the distribution of\nindel sizes among the tools themselves. From chi-square\nstatistical test between intra-tools, we see that the\ndistributions of indel sizes are not significantly different\namong the tools. The p values for intra-tool comparisons\nare showed in Additional file 1: Table S2.\nEffect of the depth of coverage on the number of indels\ncalled\nTo see how the number of indels called by these tools is\naffected by the depth of coverage, we estimated the depth\nof coverage for each human sample (shown in Additional\nfile 1: Table S1). Figure 4 shows the relationship between\nthe number of indels called by the seven tools and the\ncoverage depth. Overall, the higher the coverage is,\nthe more indels are called. Pearson correlation coeffi-\ncients between the coverage and the number of indels\ncalled by GATK_UG, VarScan, Pindel, SAMtools, Dindel,\nGATK_HC, and Platypus are 0.97 ( p value = 8.02 × 10 −48),\n0.97 ( p value = 5.25 × 10 −48), 0.91 ( p value = 3.10 × 10 −30),\n0.89 ( p value = 4.64 × 10 −27), 0.88 ( p value = 2.76 × 10 −26),\n0.86 ( p value = 2.24 × 10 −23), and 0.82 ( p value = 6.84 ×\n10−20), respectively. Thus, consistent with previous\nFig. 4 Relationship between coverage and the pooled number of indels by the seven tools\nFig. 3 Number of indels called by the seven tools for the 78 humans\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 8 of 14\nfindings [49], the number of indels called, regardless of\nthe tools, is significantly positively correlated with the\ncoverage depth.\nComparison with the set of “gold standard ” indels and\nranking of the tools\nFigure 5 shows the percentage of gold standard indels\ncalled by the tools across the 78 samples. For chromo-\nsome 11, on average, only about 1.51 % of the gold\nstandard indels are called by all seven tools, whereas\nabout 76.91 % are undetected by any of the tools. The\nremaining ~21.58 % are called by at least one tool. We\nalso compared the tools for the percentage of their own\nindels called by others regardless of the gold standard\nindels. For this purpose, we picked up Dindel, SAMtools,\nGATK_HC, and Platypus as they call more indels than\nthe other three tools. The Venn diagram in Additional\nfile 1: Figure S2 shows that only 15.64 % of the indels\nwere called by all of these four tools revealing that\nregardless of the gold standard indels, a major percent-\nage of indels remain undetected.\nWe also examined the overall performance of each\ntool on the 78 samples. The average F-measure values\nfor GATK_UG, VarScan, Pindel, SAMtools, Dindel,\nGATK_HC, and Platypus are 0.14, 0.06, 0.12, 0.26, 0.27,\n0.28, and 0.31, respectively.\nIn the ROC analysis, we ranked the seven tools based\non their distance from the “Random Guess ” line in the\nROC space. Table 2 shows the frequency of the ranks of\nthe tools based on the 78 samples. Platypus ranked the\nbest for all 78 samples, and GATK_HC ranked the\nsecond best. VarScan performed poorly, ranking the\nworst for 76 samples. Pindel performed also poorly,\nranking the worst for 2 samples and second worst for 60\nsamples. In addition to the ranking, we also computed\nthe average recall, precision, and F-measure for the tools\nin Table 2. For the average recall of the 78 samples,\nPlatypus ranks the highest (0.22), followed closely by\nGATK_HC (0.18), and VarScan the lowest (0.03). For\nthe average precision, GATK_UG ranks the highest\n(0.72), followed closely by VarScan (0.71). GATK_HC\n(0.61) and Platypus (0.56) have slightly lower average\nprecision. For the average F-measure, Platypus (0.31)\nranks the highest and VarScan (0.06) the lowest. To get\na clear idea about how the performance of the tools\ndepends on the indel types, i.e., insertion and deletion,\nwe split the benchmark dataset based on the indel types\nand results are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S3.\nResults show that except Pindel, performance of the\nother tools remains consistent regardless of the indel\ntype. Pindel shows better performance in calling deletion\nthan insertion.\nPerformance of the tools on indels of different lengths\nA natural question to ask is whether the seven tools ’\nperformance changes with different indel sizes. We\ncomputed the average F-measure (Fig. 6), false-negative\nrate (Fig. 7), recall (Additional file 1: Figure S4), and\nprecision (Additional file 1: Figure S5) of the seven tools\nfor indels of lengths 1 –10 bps. Results show that for all\nthe tools, the performance of calling indels correctly\nshows a slight decrease with the increase of indel lengths.\nPlatypus, GATK_HC, Dindel, and SAMtools show highly\nsimilar patterns for four metrics (i.e., F-measure, false-\nnegative rate, recall, and precision) with respect to indel\nlengths. Altogether, this comparison based on indels of\ndifferent lengths shows that these tools achieve similar\nperformance for different subcategories of indels with\nFig. 5 Percentage of the gold standard indels called by the tools\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 9 of 14\ncertain length. In other words, indel length is not a con-\nfounding factor that affects the performance of these\ncalling tools.\nSimilarity among the tools\nWe also compared the tools for their similarity regard-\nless of the gold standard. For each sample, the Jaccard\nindex of each pair of the tools is shown in Fig. 8, and\nthe average Jaccard index across all samples is listed in\nTable 3. From the Jaccard index, we found high similar-\nity between SAMtools and Dindel. A possible reason is\nthat both tools use the Bayesian approach for calling\nindels. SAMtools calculates the Bayesian prior probabil-\nity and uses it to calculate the actual genotype for the\nvariants detected. Dindel, on the other hand, calls indels\nby realigning the reads against candidate haplotypes for\nwhich prior probabilities calculated using the Bayesian\napproach are already known. Both SAMtools and Dindel\nperform local realignment and base quality assessment\nfor calling indels, and that is also another possible reason\nfor their similarity. Similarly, Platypus and GATK_HC also\nhave high Jaccard index value that represents their strong\nsimilarity. Being a haplotype caller, they have underlying\nsimilarity such as generating candidate haplotypes and\nthen realigning reads to each of these candidate haplo-\ntypes for variant calling which explains the reason of their\nsimilarity.\nFigure 9 shows the dendrogram on hierarchical clus-\ntering of the tools. Again we see that Dindel and SAM-\ntools group together and Platypus and GATK_HC group\ntogether which is supporting our previous observation of\nsimilarity between these tools.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, we investigated seven tools that are publicly\navailable and well known for calling indels from short\nreads. Using 78 whole genome short-read data from the\n1000 Genomes project, we evaluated these tools based on\nseveral criteria, including running time, number of indels\ncalled, recall, precision, F-measure based on the “gold\nstandard” data, and ranking and clustering of the tools.\nResults show that Platypus outperforms other tools in\nmost of the aspects.\nThe low percentage of the called indels over the “gold\nstandard” indels indicates that all these tools exhibit\nlimited power in detecting indels. Several factors could\ncontribute to the low true-positive rate. Firstly, since\nexisting read mappers map each read to the reference\nFig. 6 Average F-measure for each tool for different lengths of indels\nTable 2 Frequency of the ranks of the tools based on the ROC curve for the 78 samples.

Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 10 of 14\nsequence independently of other reads, due to the\nalignment artifacts, insertions and deletions can be\nimproperly placed relative to their true positions and it\naffects the indel calling results greatly. Secondly, most of\nthe indel calling tools do not have sophisticated methods\nfor checking sequencing errors before calling indels.\nThough Platypus, GATK_HC, and Dindel realign the\ncandidate indels to the known haplotypes, especially for\nDindel and GATK_HC, due to their high computational\ntime, it is not an efficient way when the depth of\ncoverage of the reads is high. Therefore, indel calling\nresults can be improved if these factors are considered.\nThirdly, the indels we used as gold standard were identi-\nfied from the DNA traces obtained from the trace\narchive at NCBI [50], and though it is more reliable than\nusing short reads, indels identified in this way neverthe-\nless can still be false positives, which could lead to an\nartificial decrease of true-positive rate. Fourthly, the set\nof gold standard indels is the pooled result of indels\nfrom 79 individuals, which naturally has more indels\nthan individual humans. However, this might not be the\ndominating factor causing the low false-positive rate as\nthe number of pooled indels for 78 humans is still very\nlow compared to the “gold standard ”. Finally, the low\ntrue-positive rate might also be due to the chromosome-\nspecific behavior of the calling tools. Although we have\nno particular reason to suspect that the indel calling\nresults for chromosome 11 should be different from\nthose for other autosomes, we examined the perform-\nance of the seven tools on chromosome 20 to see\nFig. 8 Jaccard index for each pair of tools for each sample\nFig. 7 Average false-negative rate for each tool for different lengths of indels\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 11 of 14\nwhether the result is chromosome specific. Results show\nthat all the metrics (i.e., reca ll, precision, and F-measures)\nfollow closely those of chromosome 11 (Additional file 1:\nFigure S6), and therefore, the poor performance of the tools\nevaluated by the gold standard indels is not chromosome\nspecific.\nClearly, an important issue in evaluating various indel\ncalling tools is the lack of a gold standard dataset or\nbenchmark dataset. In the current study, the perform-\nance comparison is done based on the “gold standard ”\ndataset that is the best possible resource available.\nAlthough it lists two million short and long indels\nextracted from the genomes of 79 diverse human, it does\nnot list all the indels that take place in the genomes of\nthe human samples we considered here. Though we can\nsay that Platypus performs better than other tools based\non the “gold standard ” dataset, however, in general, we\ncannot make a decision about which tool is the best\nunless we have the list of true indels for each sample. So\ndeveloping a list of indels for individual humans will be a\ngood direction for future research, and that list will be a\nuseful resource for validating the existing as well as newly\ndeveloped indel calling tools. Moreover, people from the\nsame ethnic group tend to have common indels [51, 52].\nTherefore, creating a list of known indels for the same eth-\nnic group and comparing the tools based on the indels\ncalled for the samples from that ethnic group would be a\nbetter way to evaluate the performance of the tools.\nBesides improving the indel calling tools, another\nstrategy to improve the indel calling result is increasing\nthe depth of coverage of the reads. For each of the\ntools, the performance shows positive correlation with\nthe coverage of the reads. Pearson correlation coeffi-\ncients between coverage and F-measure for GATK_UG,\nVarScan, Pindel, SAMtools, Dindel, GATK_HC, and\nPlatypus are 0.96 ( p value = 6.75 × 10 −44), 0.98 ( p\nvalue = 1.38 × 10 −54), 0.89 ( p value = 1.56 × 10 −27), 0.87\n(p value = 1.22 × 10 −24), 0.85 ( p value = 3.65 × 10 −23), 0.85\n(p value = 9.47 × 10 −23), and 0.81 ( p value = 1.15 × 10 −19),\nrespectively. Moreover, we also performed down-sampling\nof the individual that has 64X coverage to create a 5X\ncoverage sample and conducted indel calling using the\nseven tools. Results further confirm that higher coverage\nyields better results, reflected by higher F-measures for all\nseven tools in the 64X coverage. However, for all seven\ntools, precision is higher in the 5X coverage sample than\nin the 64X coverage sample. Detailed results are shown in\nAdditional file 1: Figure S7. Hence, the performance of the\ntools can be significantly improved by increasing the\ndepth of coverage of the reads. Consistent with our find-\ning, a previous evaluation of indel calling tools based on\nsimulation data has shown that the sensitivity of indel call-\ning tools increases with coverage depth [39]. Joint sample\ncalling is another strategy to call indels from low-coverage\ndata, and greater sensitivity can be achieved through this.\nHowever, it has a few limitations as follows: (i) Since it\ncalls variants simultaneously across all samples, computa-\ntional expense increases exponentially with the increase of\nthe number of samples, and (ii) every time a new sample\nFig. 9 Hierarchical clustering of the tools\nTable 3 Average Jaccard index for each pair of the tools (Jaccard index is computed for each pair of the tools for each human\nsample and then averaged across all the 78 samples)\nGATK_UG VarScan Pindel SAMtools Dindel GATK_HC Platypus\nGATK_UG 1 0.35 0.30 0.34 0.32 0.35 0.28\nVarScan 1 0.15 0.15 0.14 0.14 0.11\nPindel 1 0.27 0.27 0.32 0.25\nSAMtools 1 0.73 0.60 0.56\nDindel 1 0.65 0.57\nGATK_HC 1 0.64\nPlatypus 1\nHasan et al. Human Genomics  (2015) 9:20 Page 12 of 14\nis added to the cohort, the process of variant calling needs\nto start again from the scratch; this is known as the\n(N + 1) problem [53]. HaplotypeCaller like GATK_HC and\nPlatypus are free from these limitations; however, the\nother tools are yet to overcome these limitations.\nFinally, although the indel calling results produced by\nthe tools show great discrepancy, these tools can show\nstrengths in different aspects such as running time, the\nnumber of indels identified, and indels of different lengths.\nThus, integrating the strength of existing tools to call\nindels and then passing the results to an aggregating ma-\nchine learning model to increase true positives and reduce\nfalse positives might be a good solution. Similar ideas were\ndiscussed in [54] for creating highly confident SNP , indel,\nand homozygous reference genotype calls.\nConclusion\nIndel is one of the main types of disease-causing variation\nin humans. Detecting indels in an efficient manner is ne-\ncessary for discovering proper medication. The advent of\nNGS technology has made it possible to sequence human\ngenomes at an individual level. We have investigated seven\nwell-known tools, GATK Unified Genotyper (GATK_UG),\nVarScan, Pindel, SAMtools, Dindel, GATK HaplotypeCal-\nler (GATK_HC), and Platypus that call indels using NGS\ndata. Based on the benchmark dataset we used, Platypus\noutperformed other tools. However, all of these tools have\nlimitations as a large number of indels listed in the bench-\nmark dataset remain undetected. A sophisticated method\nto check sequencing errors before calling indels and an in-\ntegrative approach to combine the strengths of existing\nindel calling tools might be a good solution to overcome\nthis problem. Using reads with high coverage is another\nstrategy to obtain better results. Although the benchmark\ndataset we used for comparing the tools contain a large\nnumber of short and long indels that take place in diverse\nhuman genomes, it may not contain all the indels occur-\nring in the genome of the samples we considered here.\nHence, developing a list of known indels at an individual\nlevel will be helpful for validating the existing and newly\ndeveloped tools.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Supplementary materials for Performance\nevaluation of indel calling tools using real short-read data.
