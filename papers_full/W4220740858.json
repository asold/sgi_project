    "abstract": "This study presents a new high step-up converter based on the voltage multiplier cell and coupled inductor for renewable energy applications such as fuel cell and photovoltaic power systems. This converter achieves a high voltage conversion ratio using a coupled inductor and voltage multiplier cell (VMC). The voltage multiplier cell acts as a passive clamp circuit and reduces the maximum voltage across the power switch. The suggested topology has only one power switch in its structure, which leads to low cost and volume. The other benefits of the proposed structure are low components count, low input current ripple, low voltage stress throughout the semiconductors, high efficiency, zero-current switching (ZCS), and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) of diodes. Besides, due to the soft-switching condition of the diodes, the reverse recovery problem can be decreased. To show the effectiveness of the suggested topology, operation survey, steady-state analysis, and efficiency calculation are provided. Additionally, the comparison study with other similar converters illustrates the superiority of the proposed structure. Finally, an experimental prototype with 150 W rated power, 50 kHz switching frequency, and 24 V input voltage is implemented to prove the mathematical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed DC-DC converter.",
