Current deep learning based methods for\nsign language understanding (SLU) are prone to over-ﬁtting due to insufﬁcient sign data resource and suffer limited interpretability. In\nthis paper, we propose the ﬁrst self-supervised pre-trainable SignBERT+ framework with model-aware hand prior incorporated.

It is a visual language with\nits unique grammar and lexicon, which is non-trivial for\nthe hearing people to master. To facilitate barrier-free com-\nmunication between hearing and deaf people, automatic\nvisual sign language understanding, as a topic with broad\nsocial inﬂuence, has been widely studied. Visual sign lan-\nguage understanding contains three main tasks, including\nisolated and continuous sign language recognition (SLR)\nand sign language translation (SLT). Isolated SLR focuses on\nword level recognition, which is essentially a ﬁne-grained\nclassiﬁcation task. Differently, continuous SLR targets at\nrecognizing the sign gloss sequence with its corresponding\noccurring order, which needs to learn the sequence cor-\nrespondence across the visual and textual domains. SLT\nintends to further generate spoken language translations,\nwhich emphasizes natural linguistic expression. These three\ntasks are all important for sign language understanding and\nbring challenges from different perspectives.\nHand gesture plays a dominant role during the meaning\nexpression of sign language. Intrinsically, hand occupies a\nrelatively small spatial size, exhibiting uniform appearance\nand self-occlusion among joints. During SL expression, it\nusually occurs over complex backgrounds and presents\n• This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina under Contract U20A20183 and 62021001.

These characteristics lead to difﬁculty in hand\nrepresentation learning. Current deep-learning-based meth-\nods adaptively learn hand feature representations from the\ncropped RGB sequence. Meanwhile, considering the highly-\narticulated characteristic of hand, some methods propose to\nutilize pose as the hand representation. Pose is a compact\nand semantic representation, which is robust to appear-\nance change and brings potential computation efﬁciency.\nHowever, current pose-based methods utilize the poses\nextracted from off-the-shelf pose detectors, which usually\nsuffer failure detection due to the motion blur and complex\nbackgrounds, etc. Therefore, their performances usually lag\nlargely behind the RGB-based counterparts. Besides, the\naforementioned methods all follow a data-driven paradigm\nand suffer over-ﬁtting due to limited sign data resource and\ninsufﬁcient interpretability.\nMeanwhile, the effectiveness of pre-training has been\nvalidated in computer vision (CV) and natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks. Recent advances in NLP are largely\nderived from self-supervised pre-training techniques on\nlarge text corpus [1], [2], [3]. Among them, BERT [2] is\none of the most popular methods for its simplicity and\neffectiveness. Its success is largely attributed to the strong\nTransformer backbone [4] and well-designed pre-training\nstrategies to model the context inherent in the text corpus.\nBy adding a simple head (an MLP) on top for ﬁne-tuning,\nit achieves notable performance gains in many downstream\ntasks, especially those with limited data resource. Notably,\nnatural language is represented by a 1D sequence of text\nwords which are characterised with well-deﬁned semantic\nmeaning. However, sign video is a kind of 3D data with\ncomplex spatial-temporal context, and it is non-trivial to\nanalogically deﬁne visual word or unit with clariﬁed seman-\ntics. Therefore, it remains a hard challenge to leverage the\nsuccess of BERT to video-based sign language understand-\narXiv:2305.04868v1  [cs.CV]  8 May 2023\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 2\nEmbedding Layer\nTransformer Encoder\nHand-Model-Aware Decoder\nMask\nSelf-Supervised Pre-Training Downstream Fine-Tuning\n…\n…\n…\n①Isolated SLR\n②Continuous SLR\n③Sign Language Translation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\nEmbedding Layer\nTransformer Encoder\nTask-specific Prediction Head\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\nRecons.\nDownstream Task Overview\nDabei kann es vor allem richtung süden zum teil kräftig schneien.\n(It can snow heavily especially towards the south.)\nBESONDERS\n(especially)\nSUED\n(south)\nKOMMEN\n(come)\nKOENNEN\n(can)\nSCHNEE\n(snow)\nSTARK\n(heavily)\nSign Language Video\nSign Language Glosses\nSpoken Language Translation\n①Isolated SLR;  ②Continuous SLR;   ③Sign Language Translation \n①\n②\n③\nDownstream Task Prediction\nFig. 1. The overview of our method and sign language understanding tasks (isolated SLR, continuous SLR and SLT).\ning.\nTo tackle the above-mentioned issues, we develop a\nself-supervised pre-trainable framework with model-aware\nhand prior incorporated, namely SignBERT+, as shown in\nFigure 1. Considering the dominance of hand during SL\nexpression, we utilize the compact and expressive hand\npose as a visual token in a frame-by-frame manner. Then, we\ncarefully depict it with gesture state and spatial-temporal\nglobal position information. SignBERT+ ﬁrst performs self-\nsupervised pre-training on a large volume of hand pose\ndata, which is derived from an off-the-shelf detector on\nsign videos. Inspired by the success of BERT [2], we pre-\ntrain the encoder-decoder backbone via reconstructing the\nmasked visual tokens from the corrupted input sequence,\nwhich enforces the framework to capture the hierarchical\ncontext in the sign language domain. Considering the noisy\ncharacteristic of detected hand pose data, we carefully de-\nsign multi-scale masking strategies, including joint, frame\nand clip levels. Meanwhile, to better mine the context in\nthe sign video domain, we further incorporate hand prior\nin a model-aware method. After pre-training, we carefully\ndesign simple yet effective task-speciﬁc prediction heads,\nwhich are jointly ﬁne-tuned with the pre-trained SignBERT+\nencoder to adapt to downstream tasks.\nIn summary, our contributions are three-fold as follows,\n• To our best knowledge, we propose the ﬁrst model-\naware pre-trainable framework, namely SignBERT+.\nIt performs self-supervised pre-training on a large\nvolume of sign pose data, followed by ﬁne-tuning to\nachieve better performance on multiple downstream\ntasks.\n• To better model the hierarchical context underneath\nthe sign data during pre-training, we design multiple\nmasked modeling strategies ranging from joint to\nclip level, in coordination with incorporated model-\naware hand prior and spatial-temporal position en-\ncoding. For diverse downstream tasks, we design\nsimple yet effective task-speciﬁc prediction heads on\ntop of the pre-trained SignBERT+ encoder.\n• We perform extensive experiments to validate the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of our framework. Ex-\nperimental results demonstrate that our method\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance on video-\nbased sign language understanding tasks, including\nisolated SLR, continuous SLR and SLT.\nThis work is an extension of the conference paper [5]\nwith improvement in a number of aspects. 1) Considering\nthe characteristics of sign language, we further introduce\nspatial-temporal global position encoding into embedding,\nalong with the masked clip modeling for modeling temporal\ndynamics. Those new techniques further bring a notable\nperformance gain. 2) We extend the original framework to\ntwo more downstream tasks in video-based sign language\nunderstanding, i.e., continuous SLR and SLT. To this end, we\ndesign simple yet effective task-speciﬁc prediction heads.\nBesides, we also provide efﬁcient fusion strategies with the\nRGB modality. Our newly designed framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on all the downstream tasks.\n3) We present more comprehensive discussion on related\nworks and make deep analysis on different components of\nour method to highlight the important ingredients. Besides,\nwe add discussions on future works and broader impact.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nIn this section, we ﬁrst give a literature review for video-\nbased sign language understanding. Then we present an\noverview of pre-training strategies. Finally, we introduce\nrelated hand modeling techniques.\n2.1 Video-based Sign Language Understanding\nVideo-based sign language understanding has made re-\nmarkable progress [6], [7], [8], [9]. Generally, it contains\nthree main tasks, including isolated SLR, continuous SLR\nand SLT. These tasks emphasize different aspects, bringing\ntheir speciﬁc challenges to resolve.\nIsolated sign language recognition.Isolated SLR aims to\nrecognize at the word level, which is essentially a ﬁne-\ngrained classiﬁcation problem. This task poses a challenge\non learning discriminative visual representation [7], [10],\n[11], [12], [13]. Early works utilize hand-crafted features,\ne.g. HOG [14] and SIFT [10], to represent hand shape, ori-\nentation and motion. Recently, researchers have resorted to\ndeep learning techniques, which adaptively extract features\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 3\nfrom the full video sequence. Based on the input modality,\nthese works can be divided into RGB-based and pose-based\nmethods. RGB-based methods usually adopt Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) as the backbone. For instance,\nKoller et al. [15] utilize 2D-CNNs with LSTM to sequen-\ntially model the spatial and temporal representations. Some\nother works utilize 3D-CNNs for modeling spatial-temporal\ndependency [7], [13], [16], [17], [18].\nFor the pose-based counterpart, there exist different\nbackbones for feature extraction, including CNNs [13], [19]\nand RNNs [20], [21], [22], etc. Recently, considering its\nwell-structured nature, more and more works have utilized\ngraph convolutional networks (GCNs), which exhibit both\nefﬁciency and effectiveness [20], [22], [23]. As a represen-\ntative work, ST-GCN [24] organizes the pose sequence as a\npre-deﬁned graph and adopts GCNs to perform recognition.\nBesides, Tunga et al. further combines Transformer without\npre-training for isolated SLR [23].\nContinuous sign language recognition.It aims to map the\nsign video to the gloss sequence in the same presenting\norder. In this task, the transitions between sign glosses may\ncome with temporal variants, and the sign video usually\nlacks the frame-level gloss annotation. Therefore, it raises\na new challenge on the sequence correspondence learning\nbetween the visual sign representation to the sign glosses. To\nthis end, Koller et al. [25], [26] exploit the integration of 2D-\nCNNs and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for modeling\ntransitions. Connectionist Temporal Classiﬁcation (CTC) is\na differentiable cost function, which is able to deal with\ntwo unsegmented sequences without precise alignment. It\nusually works with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),\ne.g. BLSTM [27] and GRU [28], and Transformer [4] for\nsequential learning. CTC-based methods make end-to-end\noptimization possible and become the mainstream for its\ncompetitive performance [8], [9], [29], [30], [31]. However,\nthese methods are prone to over-ﬁtting due to limited data\nresources. To tackle this issue, DNF [29] utilizes the itera-\ntive optimization strategy for better feature representation.\nZhou et al. [32] boosts the visual encoder with the partially\nmasked videos under the supervised classiﬁcation task.\nCMA [30] proposes cross modality augmentation, which\nleverages the pseudo video-text pairs to boost recognition\nperformance. VAC [8] proposes visual alignment constraint\nto enhance the feature extractor.\nSign language translation. This task intends to generate\nthe spoken language translations. It is mainly different from\ncontinuous SLR in the aspect of sequential learning, due to\ndifferent grammar and word order between sign language\nand spoken language [33], [34]. NSLT [33] ﬁrst explores this\ntask with an attention-based encoder-decoder and proposes\nRWTH-PhoenixT dataset. This dataset provides both sign\ngloss and translation annotation, and becomes the most\npopular benchmark. Camgoz et al. [9] leverage the strong\nmodeling capability of Transformer into sequential learning.\nTSPNet [34] explores the temporal semantic structures for\nmore discriminative features. STMC [35] fuses information\nfrom multi-cue streams to boost performance. SignBT [36]\nutilizes external text corpus for performance improvement.\nIn this work, we aim to leverage a large volume of sign\ndata via pre-training to beneﬁt three main sign language\nunderstanding tasks.\n2.2 Pre-Training Strategy\nPre-training, as a common strategy in CV and NLP , aims\nto learn generic representation from massive labeled or\nunlabeled data, which beneﬁts downstream tasks with\nmarginal ﬁne-tuning cost. For fully supervised pre-training,\nit is common for CV tasks to ﬁrst pre-train CNNs under\nlabeled classiﬁcation benchmarks, e.g. ImageNet [37] and\nKinetics [38], etc. However, given the labeling cost, more and\nmore works turn to self-supervised learning from a large\nvolume of unlabeled data, which is readily available from\nthe Web [39], [40]. Self-supervised learning aims to model\nthe joint probability distribution inherent in data, which is\nbeneﬁcial to address the following discriminative learning\ntask.\nPioneering works subtly design pretext tasks to perform\nself-supervised pre-training [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46],\n[47]. These tasks include predicting colorization [41], rota-\ntion [43], transformation [46] and frame / clip orders [47],\n[48], etc. Recently, some works focus on contrastive learning\nfor pre-training [49], [50], [51]. Typically, it aims to pull\nthe representation of similar instances closer, while pushing\naway negative instances. To obtain informative negative\ninstances for better optimization, some works utilize the\ntechniques like memory banks [49] and large batch size [52].\nThere also exist works further eliminating the requirement\nof negative samples [51], [53].\nAnother interesting strand is the generative self-\nsupervised pre-training, which usually involves training the\nencoder via the reconstruction task. In NLP , one milestone of\npre-training is BERT [2]. BERT is built on the strong Trans-\nformer backbone with masked language modeling (MLM)\nas one of its pre-training tasks. MLM attempts to predict\nthe masked words by leveraging the context cues from the\nremaining tokens. Similar to BERT, some works also adopt\nMLM during pre-training, such as GPT [1], XLNet [3] and\nRoBERTa [54], etc. These pre-training methods generalize\nwell and bring notable performance gains on the down-\nstream tasks. Motivated by the success in NLP , some works\nattempt to leverage the idea of BERT into CV tasks [55], [56],\n[57], [58], [59], [60], which mainly focus on the RGB modal-\nity. BEiT [59] utilizes the discrete tokenized image patches\nas pseudo labels and performs masked modeling similar\nto BERT. MAE [60] directly works in the continuous space,\ni.e., masking and reconstructing the pixel values. However,\nBEiT and MAE only focus on image-based tasks. Actually,\nit is non-trivial to leverage BERT’s success to video-based\nsign language understanding tasks, which involves special\ndesign of the pretext task and framework architecture.\nPre-training in sign language.Albanie et al. [13] propose\nto perform supervised pre-training on a large-scale anno-\ntated dataset. Li et al. [7] boost isolated SLR via a domain-\ninvariant feature descriptor, which leverages the knowledge\nfrom external subtitled news sign video. To our best knowl-\nedge, there exists no self-supervised pre-training works in\nthe sign language domain.\n2.3 Hand Modeling Techniques\nHand modeling aims to depict the hand with more ex-\npressiveness.

Illustration of our SignBERT+ framework details, which contains self-supervised pre-training and ﬁne-tuning for the downstream tasks. We\norganize the pre-extracted 2D poses of both hands as the visual token sequence. For each token, it is embedded with gesture state and spatial-\ntemporal position encoding. During self-supervised pre-training, multi-level masked modeling strategies work with incorporated model-aware hand\nprior, in order to better capture the hierarchical context in the sign domain. Given the downstream-task diversity, we design the task-speciﬁc\nprediction head and ﬁne-tune it with the pre-trained SignBERT+ encoder.\nmeshes [64], etc. To better reconstruct the hand shape, Ia-\nson et al. [65] deﬁne scaling terms on bone lengths. Notably,\nsome works [66], [67], [68] attempt to learn hand shape\nvariation with Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) [69]. Among\nthem, MANO [68] becomes the most popular one for its\nwide applications [70], [71], [72], [73]. As a statistical model,\nit learns from a large variety of high-quality hand scans and\nrepresents the geometric changes in the low-dimensional\npose and shape space. With this capability, we adopt it as\na constraint in the decoder to incorporate prior.\n3 O UR APPROACH\nAs shown in Figure 2, our framework contains two stages,\ni.e., self-supervised pre-training and downstream task ﬁne-\ntuning. During sign expression, both hands are involved\nto act as a dominant role. Therefore, we focus on them\nto build the visual token in a frame-wise manner. For\neach visual token, we embed the gesture state and global\nspatial-temporal position information. During pre-training,\nthe whole framework works in a self-supervised paradigm\nby reconstructing the masked visual tokens from the cor-\nrupted input sequence. Jointly with the multi-level masking\nstrategies, we incorporate hand prior to better capture hi-\nerarchical context in the sign domain. Then, we ﬁne-tune\nthe pre-trained SignBERT+ encoder (embedding layer and\nTransformer encoder) with the designed prediction heads\nfor downstream tasks.\nIn the following, we ﬁrst introduce the framework archi-\ntecture. After that, we elaborate our pre-training strategy.\nFinally, we discuss the ﬁne-tuning schemes for downstream\ntasks.\n3.1 Framework Architecture\nOur framework contains four main components, i.e., input\nembedding layer, Transformer encoder, hand-model-aware\ndecoder and prediction head.\n3.1.1 Input Embedding Layer\nGiven the dominant role of hand during sign language, we\ncarefully design an embedding layer to capture cues from\nboth hands. It extracts gesture state and spatial-temporal\nposition information from the hand pose sequence in a\nframe-wise manner, which are elaborated in the follow\nparagraphs.\nGesture state embedding. Given its well-structured\ncharacteristics, we ﬁrst organize the input 2D hand pose\n˜Jt at frame t as an undirected spatial graph. This graph\nis constructed with the node V and edge E set. The node\nset includes all hand joints, i.e., 21 joints per hand, while the\nedge set contains their physical and symmetrical connection.\nThen, the hand pose sequence is processed by a spectral-\nbased GCN [24], [74], which hierarchically performs graph\nconvolution and graph pooling for gesture state embedding.\nThe graph convolution is formulated as follows,\nfout =\n∑\ni\nD\n−1\n2\ni AiD\n1\n2\ni finWi, (1)\nwhere fin and fout are the corresponding input and output\nfeatures, respectively. i indicates the type of neighbors for\neach node. Wi denotes the convolution weight and Ai is\nthe dismantled matrix indicating the edge connection. For\ngraph pooling, we ﬁrst cluster the original 21 joint nodes of\neach hand into 6 subsets corresponding to 5 ﬁngers and 1\npalm. Then we perform max-pooling on the nodes in each\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 5\nsubset, leading to 6 nodes. Finally, these nodes are again\nmax-pooled into one and both hands are involved in the\nframe-level gesture state embedding fp,t.\nSpatial-temporal position encoding.Besides the gesture\nstate, hand spatial trajectory and temporal information also\nmatter in video-based sign language understanding. We\ndepict the hand global position in the normalized 2D space\nby introducing the arm joints of both sides. These joints\nare also processed by GCN [24], [74] to extract the frame-\nlevel spatial embedding fs,t. Since the Transformer layers\nprocess the sequence in an order-agnostic way, we add\ntemporal information into the input embedding fe,t, which\nis implemented by the position encoding technique in [4].\n3.1.2 Transformer Encoder\nThe embedded input sequence is fed into the Transformer\nencoder [4] for the latent semantic representation. Its basic\nlayer mainly contains two components, i.e., a multi-head\nself-attention module and a feed-forward network. For each\nlayer, its output retains the same size with the input. The\nwhole encoder is formulated as follows,\nF0 = {fp,t + fs,t + fe,t}T\nt=1,\n˜Fi = L(M(Fi−1) + Fi−1),\nFi = L(C(˜Fi) + ˜Fi),\n(2)\nwhere i denotes the i-th layer of the Transformer encoder.\nThe whole encoder contains totally N layers. M(·), C(·) and\nL(·) represent the multi-head self-attention, feed-forward\nnetwork and layer normalization, respectively. Fi denotes\nthe output feature from the i-th layer.\n3.1.3 Hand-model-aware Decoder\nTo achieve the reconstruction target during pre-training,\nthe decoder transforms the latent feature back to the pose\nsequence. The decoder works in a model-aware method to\nincorporate prior, which aims to guide the encoder better\ncapturing generic representations in the sign language do-\nmain. Speciﬁcally, the latent feature is ﬁrst processed by a\nfully-connected layer, which extracts the low-dimensional\nsemantic embeddings depicting the hand status, i.e., hand\npose θand shape β, and the camera parameter caligning\nthe image plane, which is formulated as follows,\nFla = {θ,β,cr,co,cs}T\nt=1 = D(FN), (3)\nwhere D(·) denotes the fully-connected layer.θand β∈R10\nare the hand pose and shape embeddings for the following\nMANO model, respectively. cr ∈ R3×3, co ∈ R2, and\ncs ∈ R are parameters of the weak-perspective camera,\nrepresenting the rotation, translation and scale, respectively.\nThen the MANO model [68] incorporates hand prior and\ndecodes the estimated hand embedding. Speciﬁcally, the\ndecoding process is fully-differentiable, which transforms\nthe hand embedding (θand β) to the dense triangular hand\nmesh M ∈RNv×3 (Nv =778 vertices and Nf =1538 faces)\nas follows,\nM(β,θ) = W(T(β,θ),J(β),θ,W), (4)\nT(β,θ) = ¯T + BS(β) + BP(θ), (5)\nwhere BS(·) and BP(·) represent shape and pose blend\nfunctions, respectively. W is a set of blend weights. The\nhand template ¯T is ﬁrst posed and skinned based on the\npose and shape corrective blend shapes, i.e., BP(θ) and\nBS(β). Then the mesh M is generated by rotating each part\naround joints J(β) based on the linear skinning function\nW(·) [75]. Besides, the sparse joint representation ˜J3D is\nalso derived from the mesh. To keep consistent with the\ninput pose format, we further add 5 extra ﬁngertip joints by\nselecting vertices with the index of 333, 443, 555, 678 and\n734. Finally, ˜J3D is mapped back to the same 2D plane as\nthe input pose based on the estimated camera parameter as\nfollows,\n˜J2D = cs\n∏\n(cr ˜J3D) + co, (6)\nwhere ∏(·) denotes the orthographic projection.\n3.1.4 Prediction Head\nGiven the large diversities among downstream tasks, we\ndesign simple yet effective prediction heads for each task\nin Figure 3. In Section 3.3, we will introduce them in detail\nalong with the task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning settings.\n3.2 Pre-Training SignBERT+\nIn this section, we elaborate our pre-training paradigm. Pre-\ntraining is performed via reconstructing the masked visual\ntokens from the corrupted input sequence, which aims to\nexploit hierarchical context on a large volume of sign pose\ndata. Different from the original BERT working on discrete\nword space, we attempt to pre-train on continuous pose\nspace. Therefore, it raises new issues to resolve, including\nthe design of the masking strategies and objective functions.\n3.2.1 Masking Strategy\nConsidering the noise of the detected input hand pose, the\nmasking strategy needs to be carefully redesigned. Given\nthe hand pose sequence, we ﬁrst randomly choose a portion\nR of all tokens. For the chosen token, one of the following\noperations is applied with the equal probability,i.e., masked\njoint modeling, masked frame modeling, masked clip mod-\neling and identity modeling.\nMasked joint modeling.This strategy mimics the fail-\nure cases of pose detectors on some joints. For a chosen\ntoken, we randomly choose m joints. Two operations are\nperformed on these chosen joints with the equal probability,\ni.e., zero masking (masking the coordinates of joints with\nzeros) or random spatial disturbance. This modeling aims\nto guide the framework to infer the gesture state from the\nremaining joints, thus capturing the context at the joint level.\nMasked frame modeling.It aims to deal with the failure\ncase on the whole frame pose, which is often caused by\ncomplex backgrounds. The chosen token is directly zero\nmasked. This strategy enforces the framework to reconstruct\nthe token by leveraging the observation from the remaining\nframes and the other hand. In this way, the temporal con-\ntext for each hand and mutual context between hands are\ncaptured.\nMasked clip modeling.Motion blur, as a factor not to\nbe overlooked, usually causes pose detection failure on a\nvideo clip. To deal with this situation, masked clip modeling\nis designed. We randomly choose k temporally continuous\ntokens, where k ranges from 2 to K. The chosen k tokens\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 6\nare all zero-masked. In order to reconstruct them, the frame-\nwork needs to capture the temporal dynamics by leveraging\nthe motion pattern of existing frames.\nIdentity modeling. Similar to BERT [2], identity mod-\neling directly feeds the unchanged tokens into the frame-\nwork. It is indispensable for the framework to learn identity\nsemantic encoding on those unmasked tokens.\n3.2.2 Objective Functions\nDuring pre-training, its objective is to maximize the likeli-\nhood of the joint probability distribution to reconstruct the\nhand pose sequence. To achieve the reconstruction target,\nthe classiﬁcation objective in the original BERT is substan-\ntially changed into regression. To this end, we design the\nobjective function as follows,\nL= Lrec + λLreg, (7)\nwhere Lrec and Lreg are reconstruction and regularization\nloss terms, respectively. λdenotes the weighting factor. We\nonly include the corresponding output of the masked tokens\nduring the loss calculation.\nReconstruction loss Lrec. Since the utilized pose usu-\nally contains noise due to failure detection, we utilize the\ndetection conﬁdence score as the ﬁlter to eliminate these\ninﬂuences. The reconstruction loss is calculated as follows,\nLrec =\n∑\nt,j\n1(s(t,j) >= ϵ)s(t,j)\n˜J2D(t,j) −J2D(t,j)\n\n1\n, (8)\nwhere 1(·) denotes the indicator function, and s(t,j) de-\nnotes the detection conﬁdence score of the J2D with joint j\nat time t. The joints with the conﬁdence lower than ϵare not\nincluded in the loss calculation.\nRegularization loss Lreg. To ensure this decoder work-\ning properly, the regularization loss is added. It is imple-\nmented by constraining the magnitude and derivative of\nthe MANO input, which is responsible for generating the\nplausible mesh and keeping the signer identity unchanged.\nThis loss term is computed as follows,\nLreg =\n∑\nt\n(∥θt∥2\n2 + wβ∥βt∥2\n2 + wδ∥βt −βt−1∥2\n2), (9)\nwhere wβ and wδ denote the weighting factors.\n3.3 Fine-Tuning SignBERT+\nAfter pre-training SignBERT+ for generic visual represen-\ntation in sign language, it is relatively simple to ﬁne-tune\nit for various downstream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, the\ntask-speciﬁc prediction head is added on top of the pre-\ntrained SignBERT+ encoder, as illustrated in Figure 3. The\nframework is supervised under the task-speciﬁc loss.\nSince only the hand pose modality is insufﬁcient to con-\nvey the full meaning of sign language, we further provide\nthe task-speciﬁc fusion strategy with the method based on\nthe full RGB frames. For clarity, the baseline RGB method\nutilized for fusion will be marked in the experiment section.\nBesides, we denote our vanilla and fused framework as\nOurs and Ours (+ R), respectively.\nIsolated SLR\nSignBERT+ Encoder\nTemporal Merging \nVisual Token Sequence\n…\nContinuous SLR\nSign Gloss Sequence\nSignBERT+ Encoder\nTemporal Pooling\nVisual Token Sequence\n…\n…\nSLT\nSignBERT+ Encoder\nSemantic Modulator\nVisual Token Sequence\n…\n…\nDecoder\nSpoken Translation\nCTC Decoder\n…\n…\n…\nIsolated Word\nClassifier\n…\nFig. 3. Illustration of the settings on three downstream tasks, i.e., iso-\nlated SLR, continuous SLR and SLT. The box in purple denotes our\ndesigned task-speciﬁc prediction head. It is ﬁne-tuned with the pre-\ntrained SignBERT+ encoder.\n3.3.1 Isolated Sign Language Recognition\nIsolated SLR is a ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation problem, which\ncategorizes a sign video to the corresponding isolated word.\nFor this task, the designed prediction head consists of a\ntemporal merging module and a classiﬁer. The former mod-\nule utilizes a simple attention mechanism to highlight the\ndiscriminative cues in certain frames during the merging\nprocess as follows,\no= Softmax(FW + b) ·F, (10)\nwhere F and o denote the input feature sequence and\nmerged feature, respectively. Then the merged feature o\nis passed through a classiﬁer (MLP and softmax layer)\nto output the probability matrix. Since isolated SLR is a\nclassiﬁcation problem, we utilize the cross-entropy loss to\nsupervise the ﬁne-tuning process. We use the simple late\nfusion strategy with the RGB method, which directly sums\ntheir prediction scores and chooses the class with the highest\nscore as the ﬁnal recognition result.\n3.3.2 Continuous Sign Language Recognition\nContinuous SLR aims to recognize the gloss sequence g\nin the same presenting order as the sign actions in the\ninput sign video V with T frames. The prediction head for\nthis task contains a temporal pooling module and a CTC\ndecoder. The temporal pooling module aggregates frame-\nlevel visual features to the clip level, which outputs the one-\nquarter temporal length of the input. Then it is fed into the\nconnectionist temporal classiﬁcation (CTC) decoder to deal\nwith the mapping between two unsegmented sequences\nwithout explicit alignment.\nThe objective of CTC is to maximize the posterior prob-\nability over all alignments from the source to the target. It\nextends the vocabulary with a blank label to cover the cases\nof transition and silence. Denote each alignment path of\nthe input sequence as π = {πt|T\nt=1}with T as temporal\nduration. Under the time independence assumption, its\nprobability is computed as follows,\np(π|V) =\nT∏\nt=1\np(πt|V). (11)\nTypically, there exists many-to-one mapping from multiple\ninput sequences to one target, which is achieved by remov-\ning all blanks and repetition. In this way, we calculate the\nconditional probability of the target gloss sequence g by\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 7\nsumming the probabilities of all possible mapping paths as\nfollows,\np(g|V) =\n∑\nπ∈B−1(s)\np(π|V), (12)\nwhere B(·) denotes the many-to-one mapping function.\nB−1(·) is the inverse mapping of B(·). During training, the\nobjective is deﬁned by the negative log probability ofp(g|V)\nas follows,\nLCSLR = −ln p(g|V). (13)\nDuring inference, the CTC decoder obtains a series of sen-\ntences via beam search and chooses the one with the highest\ndecoding probability as the ﬁnal prediction.\nFor fusion, similar to [76], we ﬁrst concatenate the en-\ncoded feature from the RGB baseline and our method. Then\nwe utilize a BLSTM sequential model and a CTC decoder to\nmap the merged feature to the gloss sequence.\n3.3.3 Sign Language Translation\nGiven the input sign video V with T frames, SLT aims\nto generate the spoken language translation s = {si}N\ni=1\nwith N words via maximizing the conditional probability\np(s|V). For this task, our designed prediction head contains\na semantic modulator and a decoder as shown in Figure 3.\nConsidering the token length diversity between the\nsource and target ( T >> N ), the semantic modulator\nattempts to bridge this gap and generates suitable semantics\nM = {mi}T1\ni=1 for the decoder. Speciﬁcally, it ﬁrst performs\naverage temporal pooling to reduce the source visual token\nsequence from the length T to the length T1 = T/4. This\noperation makes the visual representation more compact,\nbut its output lacks temporal dependency modeling. To\nmitigate this issue, a Transformer encoder is adapted to\nfurther modulate the pooled visual sequence and generate\nsuitable semantics.\nAfter that, a decoder is adopted to perform mapping\nbetween sign language and spoken translation while con-\nsidering their different grammar. The decoder contains two\nmain components, i.e, a word embedding layer and an\nautoregressive Transformer decoder. The word embedding\nlayer embeds each word in the target sequences, along with\nthe added position encoding as follows,\nwi = WordEmbed(si) + PE(i), (14)\nwhere si denotes the input word, WordEmbed(·) and\nPE(·) are the word embedding and position encoding\nfunctions, respectively.\nThe autoregressive property means the model leverages\ngenerated text as additional input when generating the\nnext. The Transformer decoder architecture is also a stack\nof basic blocks. The basic block contains three compo-\nnents, i.e., masked multi-head self-attention module, multi-\nhead cross-attention module and feed-forward network. The\nmask adopted on self-attention ensures the information ﬂow\nin the rightward direction to preserve the autoregressive\nproperty [4], [77]. This operation is necessary for the SLT\ninference, since the framework is not accessible to the output\ntokens which are decoded currently or in the future. Cross-\nattention module leverages the contextual cues from the\nmodulated visual semantics M and predecessors words w.\nThe whole Transformer decoder is formulated as follows,\nD0 = w,\nQi = L( ˜M(Di−1) + Di−1),\n˜Di = L(MHA(Qi,Mk,Mv) + Qi),\nDi = L(C( ˜Di) + ˜Di),\n(15)\nwhere i denotes the i-th layer of the Transformer de-\ncoder. The whole encoder contains totally N layers. ˜M(·),\nMHA(·), C(·) and L(·) represent the masked multi-head\nself-attention, multi-head cross-attention, feed-forward net-\nwork and layer normalization, respectively. Di denotes the\noutput feature from the i-th layer.\nDuring decoding, the sentence is ﬁrst preﬁxed with the\nword “[bos]” to indicate the beginning. Then each word in\nthe target sequence sis embedded. The embedded sequence\nis then fed into the Transformer decoder TransD(·). This\ndecoder additionally performs cross attention by leveraging\nthe contextual cues from the modulated visual semantics m\nand predecessors words w. Finally, its output is fed into a\nfully-connected network and a softmax layer to generate the\nprobability matrix of the output word.\nIn summary, the whole decoding process is formulated\nas follows,\nhi = TransD(w1:i−1,m1:T1 ), (16)\noi = Softmax(Whi + b). (17)\nThe conditional probability p(s|V) is calculated as follows,\np(s|V) =\nN∏\ni=1\np(si|s1:i−1,V) =\nN∏\ni=1\noi,si . (18)\nFinally, the objective function is formulated as follows,\nLSLT = −ln p(s|V), (19)\nwhich is equivalent to calculating the cross-entropy loss on\neach word. We adopt the S2T setting [33], which directly\nmaps the sign embedding to spoken translation in an end-\nto-end manner. During inference, the framework predicts\nthe word one-by-one based on the beam search [78].\nFor fusion, we leverage the latent visual features from\nboth RGB and pose modalities, i.e., Mr and Mp, to the same\ndecoder. Speciﬁcally, we replace the original cross attention\nin the decoder with the cascaded one, which is formulated\nas follows,\n˜Di = MHA(MHA(Qi,Mk\np,Mv\np),Mk\nr,Mv\nr), (20)\nwhere MHA(·) denotes the multi-head cross-attention\nlayer, Qi denotes the feature from the previous decoder\nlayer, and ˜Di is the output of the cascaded attention.\n4 E XPERIMENT\nIn this section, we ﬁrst introduce the experiment setup,\ni.e., datasets, evaluation metrics and implementation details.\nThen we perform ablation studies on the framework ef-\nfectiveness from multiple perspectives. Finally, we perform\nextensive experiments to make comparison with state-of-\nthe-art methods on multiple downstream tasks.\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 8\n4.1 Experiment Setup\n4.1.1 Datasets\nWe ﬁrst perform experiments on the dataset with hand pose\nannotations available to evaluate the framework feasibility.\nHANDS17 [79] is a video-level hand pose estimation dataset\nwith 292,820 frames from 99 video sequences. For each\nvideo, the ﬁrst 70% and remaining 30% frames are separated\nfor training and testing, respectively.\nWe evaluate our proposed method on three main video-\nbased sign language understanding tasks, i.e., isolated SLR,\ncontinuous SLR and SLT. The corresponding datasets for\neach task are discussed in the follow.\nFor isolated SLR, we make evlauation on three datasets,\ni.e., MSASL [17], WLASL [18], and SLR500 [16]. MSASL [17]\nis an American sign language (ASL) dataset containing a\nvocabulary of 1,000, with 25,512 samples. Besides, it also re-\nleases two subsets (MSASL100 and MSASL200) by choosing\nthe Top-K most frequent signs. WLASL [18] is another ASL\ndataset with 2,000 signs and 21,083 samples. It also contains\ntwo subsets, i.e., WLASL100 and WLASL300. MSASL and\nWLASL are both collected from the Web, which are recorded\nin unconstrained real-life conditions with unbalanced sam-\nples for each sign word. These factors bring new challenges\non accurate recognition. SLR500 [16] is the largest CSL\ndataset, which contains 500 daily signs and 125,000 samples\nrecording at the resolution of 1280 ×720. These samples\nare split into 90,000 and 35,000 for training and testing,\nrespectively.\nFor continuous SLR, the evaluation is conducted on two\ndatasets, i.e., RWTH-Phoenix [14] and RWTH-PhoenixT [33].\nRWTH-Phoenix [14] is a popular German sign language\ndataset collected from the weather forecast broadcast. It\ncontains 6,841 samples, with 5,672, 540 and 629 videos\nfor training, validation and testing, respectively. RWTH-\nPhoenixT [33] is included for evaluation, which is intro-\nduced in “SLT datasets”.\nFor SLT, we make evaluation on RWTH-PhoenixT [33]\ndataset, which is treated as the extended version of RWTH-\nPhoenix. It provides parallel sign gloss and translation an-\nnotations, to evaluate both continuous SLR and SLT tasks.\nIt contains 8,257 videos, which are divided into three sets:\n7,096 for training, 519 for validation, and 642 for testing.\nRWTH-Phoenix and RWTH-PhoenixT are both recorded at\nthe resolution of 210 ×260.\n4.1.2 Evaluation Metrics\nTo evaluate whether our framework works during pre-\ntraining, we adopt the metrics for evaluating pose esti-\nmation accuracy. Speciﬁcally, we report the Percentage of\nCorrect Keypoints (PCK) score and the Area Under the\nCurve (AUC) on the PCK threshold ranging from 20 to\n40 pixels. PCK deﬁnes the keypoint to be correct if the\nEuclidean distance between this keypoint and ground truth\nis lower than the threshold. The distance metric is expressed\nin pixels.\nFor isolated SLR, We utilize the accuracy metrics, includ-\ning per-instance (P-I) and per-class (P-C) metrics. P-I and\nP-C denote the average accuracy over all the instances and\nclasses, respectively. Following previous works [5], [13], we\nreport Top-1 and Top-5 P-I and P-C metrics on MSASL\nand WLASL. Since each class in SLR500 contains the same\nnumber of samples, P-I is equal to P-C and we only report\none of them.\nFor continuous SLR, we utilize Word Error Rate (WER) as\nthe evaluation metric. WER is the editing distance, which\nmeasures the least operations (substitution, deletion and\ninsertion) to transform the hypothesis to the reference gloss\nsentence as follows,\nWER = Ni + Nd + Ns\nL , (21)\nwhere Ni, Nd, and Ns are the number of operations for\ninsertion, deletion, and substitution, respectively. Ldenotes\nthe length of the reference sentence.\nFor SLT, we adopt BLEU [80] and ROUGE [81] metrics\nwhich are commonly utilized in neural machine translation.\nBLEU calculates the overlap rate of n-gram between the\ngenerated text and the reference text, and nranges from 1 to\n4. ROUGE is a metric based on the recall rate and measures\nthe sentence-level structure similarity. In this work, we refer\nto the ROUGE-L F1-Score.\n4.1.3 Implementation Details\nIn our experiment, all the models are implemented by\nPyTorch [82] and trained on NVIDIA RTX 3090. Since sign\nlanguage datasets contain no available pose annotations,\nwe utilize MMPose [83] to extract 133 full 2D keypoints,\nconsisting of 23 body joints, 68 face joints and 42 hand\njoints. The hyper-parameters ϵ, λ, wβ and wδ are set as\n0.5, 0.01, 10.0 and 100.0, respectively. During decoding, the\nbeam width is set as 10 and 3 for continuous SLR and SLT,\nrespectively.\nDuring the pre-training stage, the utilized data includes\nthe training data from all aforementioned sign datasets,\nalong with other collected data from [84], [85]. In total,\nthe pre-training data volume is 230,246 videos. The Adam\noptimizer is adopted to train the framework for 60 epochs\nwith the weight decay set as 0.01. The learning rate warms\nup over the ﬁrst 10% of the training process, and then decays\nlinearly from the peak rate (1e-4). All the frames are fed into\nthe framework.\nFor all the downstream tasks, the Adam optimizer is still\nadopted. The learning rate for isolated SLR, continuous SLR\nand SLT are 1e-4, 1e-4 and 5e-5, respectively. For continuous\nSLR and SLT, we follow the setting [9]. Spatial-temporal\ndata augmentation is utilized during training. Spatially,\nfollowing [24], we adopt random moving augmentation to\nsimulate spatial disturbance induced by rotation, translation\nand scaling factors. Temporally, for isolated SLR, we extract\n32 frames from the origin video using random and center\nsampling for training and testing, respectively. While for\ncontinuous SLR and SLT, we randomly sample 80% frames\nduring training and utilize all the frames during testing.\n4.2 Ablation Study\nIn this section, we ﬁrst validate the framework feasibility.\nThen we perform detailed ablation studies on different\ncomponents of our framework.\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 9\nTABLE 1\nFramework feasibility validation on HANDS17. “P@20” denotes the\nPCK metrics with the error threshold set as 20 pixel. “Joint”, “Frame”\nand “Clip” denote the masked joint modeling, masked frame modeling\nand masked clip modeling, respectively. “Input” and “Output” represent\nthe corrupted input pose and the reconstructed pose sequence by our\nframework, respectively.\nMask Input Output\nJoint Frame Clip P@20 AUC P@20 AUC\n✓ 90.06 89.99 94.60 95.15\n✓ 74.83 74.80 93.30 95.13\n✓ 60.99 60.00 91.94 93.47\n✓ ✓ ✓ 66.65 66.63 94.00 94.74\nTABLE 2\nImpact of the Transformer layersN on MSASL dataset.

In this setting, we adopt\nall masked modeling strategies to train our framework\non this dataset. During validation, we perform different\nmasking cases on the input sequence and evaluate the\nframework output quality. As shown in Table 1, the output\nmetrics are higher than those of the input under all masking\ncases, which validates our framework feasibility. Besides,\nwe qualitatively visualize the hand pose reconstruction in\nFigure 4. It can be observed that the reconstructed hand pose\nsequence is consistent with the ground truth, even under the\nseverely corrupted input situation. It is largely attributed to\ninherent contextual cues captured by our framework via our\ndesigned pretext task.\n4.2.2 Ablation Study\nTo study the impact of different hyper-parameters and set-\ntings in our approach, we conduct experiments on MSASL\nand its subset with per-instance and per-class Top-1 accu-\nracy as the performance indicator.\nImpact of the Transformer layers N. As shown in Ta-\nble 2, the accuracy gets improved when the number N of\nTransformer layers increases. It reaches the peak when N is\nequal to 3. There exists difference in the best N between the\noriginal BERT and ours, which may be attributed to different\ncharacteristics between the sign pose and text domains. In\nall the experiments, we set N as 3 unless stated.\nImpact of the poseθdimension in the hand-model-aware\ndecoder. From Table 3, the pose θdimension represents the\nMANO characterization capability of the hand gesture. The\nincrease of the pose dimension brings enhanced capability\nand accuracy improvement on the downstream SLR. It\nreaches the top when the dimension is equal to 25.

The suitable temporal mask span\nenforces the framework to capture the temporal dynamics\nduring sign language. In the following, we set Kas 8 unless\nstated.\nImpact of different temporal information extraction on\nMSASL dataset. There are many alternative methods to\nextract temporal information. Besides temporal position\nencoding, directly extracting temporal information is also\na solution. To this end, we modify the current GCN into\nthe temporal variant following the practice in [74]. Specif-\nically, the original spatial GCN graph is replaced with\nthe spatial-temporal one via adding the local connections\nalong the temporal dimension. With this modiﬁcation, the\ngesture state extractor embeds the temporal receptive ﬁeld\nof additional kadjacent input frames and thus captures the\ntemporal information. Besides, since our pretext task needs\nto recover the masked pose token in the corresponding\noutput, we utilize padding to keep the sequence length after\nthe gesture extractor the same as the input.\nAs shown in Table 5, we perform comparison on these\ndifferent temporal extraction methods. “PE” denotes utiliz-\ning the position encoding for temporal information extrac-\ntion. For “GCN Tem-k”, we remove the temporal position\nencoding and directly extract temporal information via our\nmodiﬁed GCN backbone. k represents the number of adja-\ncent frames. These settings achieve comparable performance\non the downstream SLR. It can be explained that the fol-\nlowing Transformer encoder contains the strong capability\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 10\nTABLE 6\nEffectiveness of the spatial-temporal position encoding (“PE”) on\nMSASL dataset.\nPE 100 200 1000\nTemporal Spatial P-I P-C P-I P-C P-I P-C\n77.68 77.93 73.07 73.50 51.80 48.76\n✓ 79.00 79.05 74.39 74.51 52.97 49.95\n✓ 82.96 82.75 75.94 77.15 60.95 58.82\n✓ ✓ 84.94 85.23 78.51 79.35 62.42 60.15\nTABLE 7\nEffectiveness of the masking ratio R on MSASL dataset.\nR 100 200 1000\nP-I P-C P-I P-C P-I P-C\n20% 78.47 78.46 69.09 70.62 59.52 56.15\n30% 82.30 82.33 76.23 76.79 61.07 57.92\n40% 84.94 85.23 78.51 79.35 62.42 60.15\n50% 82.96 83.26 76.31 77.40 60.93 57.95\n60% 80.18 81.06 75.64 76.21 59.80 57.25\nTABLE 8\nEffectiveness of the masking strategy on MSASL dataset.

The ﬁrst row denotes the re-\nsults without any position encoding. In the second row,\nwe incorporate the temporal inforamtion with the temporal\nposition encoding. In the third row, we incorporate the\nglobal hand information in the form of hand spatial position\nencoding and involve all arm joints (totally 7 joints).

We study the in-\nﬂuence of the masking ratio in Table 7. It is observed that\nthe performance reaches the top when the masking ratio is\nequal to 40%, which is inconsistent with BERT [2].

Among them, masked clip modeling brings the\nlargest performance gain. When all these masking strategies\nare utilized, it reaches the best performance.\nEffectiveness of the model-aware decoder. We compare\nthe effects of different pose decoders in Table 9. The ﬁrst\ntwo rows represent that we utilize fully-connected layers\nto directly regress the keypoints for pose reconstruction\nduring pre-training. Compared with the direct regression\nmethod, our decoder incorporates prior via regressing the\ncompact gesture embedding, which eases optimization and\nbrings a larger performance gain on the downstream SLR.\nBesides, our decoder also exhibits the additional beneﬁt,\nwhich inﬂates the input 2D sequence to the corresponding\n3D mesh as the intermediate representation.\nEffectiveness of the pre-training data scale. We study\nthe impact of the pre-training data scale in Table 10. We\nrandomly extract a portion of all training data, indicated in\nthe “Ratio” column. Then we pre-train and ﬁne-tune our\nframework based on the same setup. It is observed that\nthe accuracy grows monotonically when the pre-training\ndata volume increases, which suggests our framework may\nbeneﬁt from even more pre-training data.\n4.3 Qualitative Visualization\nWe visualize the reconstruction results under the sign data\nsources after pre-training in Figure 5 and 6.

Even under these\nhard cases, our framework can rectify the noisy inputs and\ninfer all the poses which well align the image plane. This\nstrong hallucination capability may be largely attributed to\nthe well-modeled statistics in the sign language domain.\n4.4 Comparison with Other Pre-Training Strategies\nAs demonstrated in Table 11, we compare with other pre-\ntraining strategies, including supervised and state-of-the-art\nself-supervised pre-training methods.

Speciﬁcally, supervised pre-training is conducted on a\nportion of the original pre-training data (denoted as “Par-\ntial”), i.e., the corresponding classiﬁcation (isolated SLR)\nbenchmarks. The “Partial” and “All” data volumes are\n160,113 and 230,246 videos, respectively.\nFor fair comparison with supervised pre-training, we\ndeﬁne two evaluation settings for self-supervised methods,\ni.e., pre-training on the “Partial” and “All” data volumes.\nWe adopt the state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training\nmethod, i.e., V-MoCo [86]. It is based on contrastive learning,\nand can be treated as the extended version of MoCo [49]\ninto the video domain. Since it originally works on the\nRGB domain, we make a few modiﬁcations by replacing\nits backbone with ours, which is able to process the pose\nmodality. During pre-training, we randomly sample two\nclips with 32 consecutive frames from the same sign pose\nsequence, as the query and positive samples. The negative\nsamples are obtained from the clips of other videos. During\ntraining, its objective is to maximize the similarity between\nthe query and positive samples, which aims to learn tempo-\nrally persistent features of the same video.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of these pre-training\nmethods on all three downstream tasks, i.e., isolated\nSLR (MSASL, WLASL, SLR500), continuous SLR (RWTH-\nPhoenix and RWTH-PhoenixT) and SLT (RWTH-PhoenixT).\nIn isolated SLR, supervised pre-training brings a larger per-\nformance gain than V-MoCo. While for continuous SLR and\nSLT, the supervised pre-training method brings a relatively\nsmaller performance gain, whose performance is worse\nthan that of V-MoCo. Supervised pre-training exhibits the\nlimited generalization capability to the downstream tasks,\nwhose objective is inconsistent with classiﬁcation. For self-\nsupervised pre-training methods, i.e., V-MoCo and Ours,\nthey do not rely on annotated data and scale well with larger\npre-training data volume. Notably, when compared with\nother pre-training strategies, our method achieves the best\nperformance on all downstream tasks with notable gains.\n4.5 Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods\nIn this section, we compare our method with previous state-\nof-the-art methods on three main downstream tasks, includ-\ning isolated SLR, continuous SLR and SLT. For comparison,\nwe group them into pose-based and RGB-based methods.\n4.5.1 Isolated Sign Language Recognition\nEvaluation on MSASL [17].MSASL introduces new chal-\nlenges given its unconstrained recording conditions. As\nillustrated in Table 12, the accuracy of previous pose-based\nmethods lags largely behind the RGB-based counterpart. It\nis mainly attributed to the pose detection failure caused by\npartially occluded upper body, motion blur and complex\nbackground, etc. TCK [7] and BSL [13] propose different\npre-training techniques on the I3D backbone by leverag-\ning external sign data. Our method achieves new state-\nof-the-art performance under both pose-based and RGB-\nbased comparison settings with a notable gain. Notably,\nwhen compared with previous SignBERT [5], our frame-\nwork outperforms it by 12.88% per-instance Top-1 accuracy\nimprovement on the full set.\nEvaluation on WLASL [18]. WLASL is also the uncon-\nstrained recording setting. Compared with MSASL, it is\nmore challenging with fewer samples and doubled vocab-\nulary size. As shown in Table 13, it is worth mentioning\nthat our single pose-based method even outperforms the\nmost challenging RGB-based method [7], [13], with over 2%\nTop-1 per-instance accuracy improvement on all sets. When\nfused with the RGB baseline, the performance of our method\nfurther gets improved.\nEvaluation on SLR500 [16].As demonstrated in Table 14,\nSTIP [87] and GMM-HMM [88] are the traditional meth-\nods based on hand-crafted features. Since this dataset is\nrecorded under the controlled setting, the performance is\nquite saturated with only Top-1 accuracy reported.

As demonstrated in\nTable 16, we exhibit experiment results on RWTH-Phoenix\ndataset. Due to the lack of pose-based methods, we adopt\ntwo representative RGB-based methods [9], [29] by only\nchanging its visual encoder with the GCN to process pose\nmodality, denoted as “P-BLSTM” and “P-Trans”. Pose-based\nmethods lag largely behind RGB-based methods, which is\nlargely caused by pose failure caused by the low-quality\ndata and motion blur. Among pose-based methods, our\nmethod largely outperforms the most challenging competi-\ntor P-BLSTM with 5.6% and 5.2% WER improvement on\nthe dev and test set, respectively. When fused with the\nRGB baseline, our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, i.e., 19.9% and 20.0% WER on the dev and test\nset, respectively.\nEvaluation on RWTH-PhoenixT [33].We make comparison\non RWTH-PhoenixT in Table 17.

[101] make the ﬁrst attempt of user study to\nevaluate the built sign gloss dictionary for sign language\nlearners. Evaluation participation of the deaf community\nis also crucial to better analyze our method and outline\nfuture work. In our work, the effectiveness of pre-training is\nevaluated on the downstream tasks and it is also desirable\nto perform more direct evaluation on pre-training.\nTo this end, we conduct a user study with the Institu-\ntional Review Board (IRB) approval from our college with\ngranted number No.202200603. This user study aims to ana-\nlyze the robustness of our framework under different input\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 16\nTABLE 18\nUser study with deaf community on robustness of our pre-training\nmodel under different input noise levels.

Different\nnoise levels are achieved via choosing different portions of\nthe input tokens to add noise. There are 10 deaf volunteers\nparticipating in this study. In the study, each volunteer is\nasked to judge whether the corresponding sign gloss can be\nidentiﬁed via observing the framework output. We report\nthe correct rate to indicate semantic preservation. Totally,\n100 real-world sign videos are collected and involved in\nthis study. For each video, there are 8 samples, i.e., 4 (noise\nlevels) ×2 (input and output) needed to be evaluated.\nAs shown in Table 18, it can be observed that the se-\nmantics of the output are well-preserved when the input\nnoise intensity increases, which validates the robustness of\nour framework. Meanwhile, the correct rate of the output\nis consistently better than that of the input under all noise\nlevels. It reveals that the modeled statistics via our pre-\ntraining can bring positive gains on the semantics. Besides,\nthese deaf participants also give us feedback on the reasons\nof failed recognition from their perspectives, e.g. pose jit-\ntering, nonstandard gesture, etc. These results can give us\nsome hints on further improving the pre-training design,\ne.g. inserting the basic gesture types of sign language as the\nconstraint.\n4.7 Analysis & Future Work\nThe core of our work is modeling the statistics in the sign\nlanguage domain via maximizing the likelihood of the joint\nprobability distribution, which beneﬁts the downstream\nsign language understanding tasks. Despite the success of\nBERT in NLP , it is non-trivial to leverage its masked mod-\neling pretext task into sign language understanding due to\ndifferent characteristics between these two domains. Among\nthem, the major one is information density [60]. Originally,\nthe languages are highly semantic and well represented\nwith 1D sequences of text words, which are deﬁned with\nclariﬁed semantics. In contrast, sign pose, expressed in 3D\ncontinuous coordinates, is a kind of well-structured data\nwith both spatial and temporal redundancy. Besides, this\nkind of signal usually contains noise due to failure estima-\ntion. This fundamental difference raises the following issues\nto resolve, which outlines potential future work.\n• Token embedding & Position encoding. These em-\nbeddings are needed to be carefully designed con-\nsidering the hand pose characteristics in the sign\nlanguage domain, e.g. how to effectively represent\nspatial-temporal positions of hands.\n• Masking strategy. It aims to capture the hierarchical\ncontext in the sign data, which needs to consider the\ncharacteristic of sign pose data.\n• Decoder design & Pre-training objective. The de-\ncoder in the pre-training stage performs mapping\nfrom the latent feature back to the input. In NLP ,\nthe decoder predicts the masked discrete words with\nthe cross-entropy objective. While for this task, the\ngoal is to reconstruct the continuous sign hand pose\nsequence. The involved pre-training objective and\ndecoder are needed to design.\nMore discussion. In this work, we provide our solution\nto the above issues and validate the effectiveness of our\nframework. Pre-training on pose has its pros and cons. Pose\ndata is a semantic and compact representation, which is\nrobust to appearance or background changes and brings\npotential computation efﬁciency. On the other hand, our\nadopted pose input is estimated by the off-the-shelf pose\ndetector. Although our framework embeds the capability to\ncapture the cues from the corrupted input pose sequence,\nits bottleneck is somewhat limited by the quality of the\ndetected pose. Jointly optimizing the pose detector with\nour framework may be a possible solution. It is also desir-\nable to extend masked-modeling-based self-supervised pre-\ntraining to RGB data. Besides, pre-training can go beyond\nself-supervised learning, e.g. multilingual information may\nbe merged as an auxiliary indicator for better performance\non downstream tasks.\n5 C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose the ﬁrst self-supervised pre-\ntrainable framework with hand prior incorporated, namely\nSignBERT+. Given the dominant role of hand during sign\nlanguage, we take both hands as visual tokens and care-\nfully embed each visual tokens with gesture state and\nspatial-temporal position information. Our framework ﬁrst\nperforms pre-training on a large volume of sign data via\nreconstructing the masked tokens from the corrupted input\nsequence. Speciﬁcally, we subtly design hierarchical masked\nmodeling strategies (joint, frame and clip). These strate-\ngies explicitly consider hand pose characteristics to cap-\nture multi-level contextual information. Furthermore, we\ndesign the hand-model-aware decoder to incorporate prior\nfor better optimization and context modeling. Then, the\npre-trained SignBERT+ is ﬁne-tuned for downstream tasks.\nGiven the task diversities, we design simple yet effective\nprediction heads on top of the SignBERT+ encoder during\nﬁne-tuning. Extensive experiments are conducted among\nthree main video-based sign language understanding tasks,\ni.e, isolated SLR, continuous SLR and SLT. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achiev-\ning new state-of-the-art performance with a notable gain.\nBroader Impact.It is estimated by World Health Organiza-\ntion (WHO) that by 2050 over 700 million people will have\ndisabling hearing loss, which accounts for 10% of global\npopulation [102]. The community with hearing loss may\nfeel isolated, lonely and other mental issues when they face\nthe communication barrier in daily life. One way to assist\nthem is to bridge this gap via the automatic sign language\nunderstanding technique. Our framework is able to promote\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, APRIL 2023 17\nits development. However, our technique is not intended\nfor the potential privacy issue, such as surveillance on sign\nlanguage communication.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. Radford, K. Narasimhan, T. Salimans, and I.
