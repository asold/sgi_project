    "abstract": "Abstract Generative models have demonstrated substantial promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have found application in designing molecules, as seen in General Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models. In our efforts to develop such a tool for exploring the organic chemical space in search of potentially electro-active compounds, we present Llamol , a single novel generative transformer model based on the Llama 2 architecture, which was trained on a 12.5M superset of organic compounds drawn from diverse public sources. To allow for a maximum flexibility in usage and robustness in view of potentially incomplete data, we introduce Stochastic Context Learning (SCL) as a new training procedure. We demonstrate that the resulting model adeptly handles single- and multi-conditional organic molecule generation with up to four conditions, yet more are possible. The model generates valid molecular structures in SMILES notation while flexibly incorporating three numerical and/or one token sequence into the generative process, just as requested. The generated compounds are very satisfactory in all scenarios tested. In detail, we showcase the model’s capability to utilize token sequences for conditioning, either individually or in combination with numerical properties, making Llamol a potent tool for de novo molecule design, easily expandable with new properties. Scientific contribution We developed a novel generative transformer model, Llamol, based on the Llama 2 architecture that was trained on a diverse set of 12.5 M organic compounds. It introduces Stochastic Context Learning (SCL) as a new training procedure, allowing for flexible and robust generation of valid organic molecules with up to multiple conditions that can be combined in various ways, making it a potent tool for de novo molecular design.",
