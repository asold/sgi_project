INTRODUCTION  \nTransformer is one of the most crucial assets in electricity \nnetworks and the transformer’s health conditions highly \ndepend on its insulation system. Partial discharge (PD) \nmeasurement is an effective method for evaluating the \ninsulation system [1], [2]. However, PD signals collected from \nPD measurements in substation environment are always \noverwhelmed by a variety of interference and noise. This can \npose significant difficulties in recognizing PD patterns \ngenerated from corresponding insulation defects in a \ntransformer and making explicit diagnosis on its insulation \nsystem. \nThere are different types of noise that can exist during PD \nmeasurements, such as white noise, periodic impulsive and \nsinusoidal noise, and stochastic noise [3]-[6]. Among the \nabove types of noise, stochastic noise is considerably difficult \nto remove and limited research works have been reported in \nthe literature. In [7], neural network is used to remove \nstochastic noise. However, this method requires a training \nprocess to create a database for classifying PD pulses \ngenerated by different PD sources. For those situations that \ncollected PD signals do not belong to the database can induce \nmisclassifications. The major difficulty on removing \nstochastic noise is due to its similarity in frequency \ncharacteristics with PD signals [6]. Therefore, conventional \nmethods such as notch filtering and gating method are not able \nto provide an effective filtering for stochastic noise.  \nRecently, wavelet transform attains a high attention on \nremoving noise from collected signals for PD measurements \n[3]-[6]. The principle of wavelet transform is based on signal \ndecomposition through selected wavelet functions. PD signals \ncan be separated from noise in the decomposed signals with \ndifferent frequency scales. By applying thresholds to the \ndecomposed signals and performing signal reconstruction, PD \nsignals can be retrieved while noise can be removed. However, \nfrequency scales of stochastic noise can be the same as those \nof PD signals. This implies that PD signals may not be \ndistinguished from stochastic noise using wavelet transform. \nSince no research works address this issue, this paper (Section \nV) examines the capability on using wavelet transform for \nremoving stochastic noise. \nThis paper proposes a hybrid of fractal dimension and \nentropy analyses for effectively distinguishing and extracting \nPD signals from collected signals corrupted by stochastic \nnoise. Fractal dimension is a method to describe complex \nshapes, such as coastlines and mountains, by using fractal sets \n[9], while entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a signal. In \nthe proposed method, fractal dimension is used to separate PD \nsignals from the noise, which locates in distinctive power \ncycles from the PD signals. Meanwhile, entropy is calculated \nto distinguish and extract PD signals from the noise, which \ndistributes over the power cycles with PD signals. \nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents \nexperimental set-up of PD measurements. Section III provides \na brief introduction on fractal dimension and entropy. Section \nIV describes the proposed method on stochastic noise removal \nand PD signal extraction from raw signals (i.e. noise-corrupted \nsignals) collected from PD measurements. Section V presents This work was supported by the Australia Research Council (ARC) on \nLinkage Grant. \nresults by applying the proposed method to measured signals \nobtained from both experimental models and a substation \ntransformer. A comparison with a wavelet transform-based \nnoise removal method is also provided. Section VI concludes \nthe paper.  \nII.  EXPERIMENTAL SET -UP  \nThe PD measurement set-up used in this paper is based on \nIEC 60270 standard (Fig. 1) [10]. In the set-up, V is a voltage \nsource, C a is a test object (i.e. a PD experimental model or a \ntransformer), C k is a coupling capacitor, Z is measuring \nimpedance, and M is a data acquisition and processing system. \nPD experimental models simulate PD sources using different \nconfigurations (Fig. 2). The model shown in Fig. 2a simulates \ndischarge with flat cavity by putting four pressboards \n(diameter = 40 mm) together in transformer oil with a cavity \n(diameter = 15 mm) at the center. The model shown in Fig. 2b \nsimulates corona with 50 mm distance between a needle and \ngrounding. The model shown in Fig. 2c placed in air simulates \nsurface discharge by using one pressboard putting between the \nneedle and grounding. These experimental models were used \nto generate both single and multiple PD sources. \n \nFigure 1.

INTRODUCTION ON FRACTAL D IMENSION AND ENTROPY  \nA.  Fractal Dimension \nThe concept of fractal dimension refers to changes of a \npattern’s details with respect to the scales used for measuring \nthis pattern. A number of methods including box-counting, \nvariance, and spectral methods are used for calculating fractal \ndimension [11]. This paper adopts box-counting for its \nsimplicity and efficiency [12]. Fractal dimension (FD) of a \nsignal in Euclidean space is defined as [13]: \n ) 1log( \n) (log lim \n0 ε\nε=\n→ ε\nNFD  (1) \nwhere ) (εN  is the least number of boxes with side length ε \nto cover the signal.  \nA PD source caused by a particular insulation defect can \nexhibit a unique PD pattern. Due to its ability of representing \nvarious patterns and describing complex shapes, fractal \ndimension has been used for feature extraction and recognition \nof PD sources [13], [14]. This paper makes use of fractal \ndimension to remove and quantify severity of noise.  \nB.  Entropy \nWhen PD signals and noise merge together, fractal \ndimension alone may not be able to recover PD signals and \nthus entropy is used. Entropy is a measure of disorder in a \nrandom variable. A larger value of entropy relates to more \nchaotic data [15]. For a signal [ ]nxx xX ,..., , 2 1= , its entropy, \n( )XH , is defined as:   \n ( ) ∑\n=\n− =\nn\ni\nii x px pXH\n1\n2 ) (log ) (  (2) \nwhere ) (ix p is the probability mass function of ix . \nThis paper adopts entropy to find how abundant \ninformation is in each box of fractal dimension. This can help \nto differentiate PD signals from noise. Next section will \nprovide more details on the application of fractal dimension \nand entropy for stochastic noise removal on PD measurements. \nIV.  PROPOSED M ETHOD ON STOCHASTIC N OISE R EMOVAL  \nFig. 3 depicts the flowchart of the proposed stochastic \nnoise removal method for PD measurements. Firstly, a \ncollected one-dimensional (1D) noise-corrupted signal \nconsisting of both PD signal and stochastic noise is \ntransformed into a two-dimensional (2D) signal. In this \ntransformation, the original signal in a power cycle is \nconverted to 512 x 512 pixels for accurately representing the \nsignal while still maintaining reasonable processing time in \nsubsequent fractal dimension and entropy calculations. Then, \nfractal dimension is calculated on the transformed 2D signal in \neach power cycle with different side lengths of boxs, 2x, where \n[ ]nx ,..., 2 , 1= . If severe noise presents in a particular power \ncycle, the value of fractal dimension in this power cycle is \ndifferent from that of others. Thus, it is able to indicate the \npresent of noise. Subsequently, the noise can be removed by \ndiscarding the signal in the power cycle with noise and \nselecting the signals in other cycles. \n \nFigure 3.   Proposed stochastic noise removal method. \nSince noise may locate in every or most of power cycles \nwith similar fractal dimension values, using fractal dimension \nalone may not be able to completely distinguish and separate \nPD signals from noise. Moreover, even at the situations that \nfractal dimension can distinguish noise appearing at most of \npower cycles; it is still not wise to discard all signals located \nin those power cycles. Therefore, entropy is calculated in each \nbox within each power cycle.  \nFor a signal generated by stochastic noise, if it locates in a \nparticular box in a power cycle, it is unlikely present at the \nsame box in other power cycles when compared with PD \nsignals. Based on this assumption, entropy value of the noise \nin each box is not as high as that of PD signals. After adding \nentropy values of the same box for every power cycle together \nand using color to represent the sum (the highest to lowest \nvalues are represented by a colormap ranging from red, orange, \nyellow, cyan, to blue), PD signals (i.e. noise-removed signals) \ncan be identified and subsequently extracted from noise-\ncorrupted signals. \nV.  R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS  \nTo evaluate the proposed method on stochastic noise \nremoval, PD signals were collected from PD measurements on \nthe experimental models (Fig. 2). PD signals were also \ncollected from a PD measurement on a 5 MVA power \ntransformer for further evaluation of the proposed method. A \ncomparison with a wavelet transform-based noise removal \nmethod has also been made in this section to justify the \neffectiveness of the proposed method. \nA.  Noise Removal Evaluation on PD Experimental Models \nFig. 4 presents noise removal results on a PD measurement \nperformed for the PD experimental model of discharge with \nflat cavity (i.e. Fig. 2a). From Fig. 4a (original PD \nmeasurement signal), it can be observed that the PD signal \nlocates periodically in most of power cycles. Severe stochastic \nnoise occurs at the 1\nst  and 2 nd  power cycles where relatively \ninsignificant noise can be found at the 3rd  power cycle. The \nstochastic noise was generated by occasional discharges from \nthe transformer supplying voltage to the PD measurement \nsystem and the coupling capacitor in the measurement circuit \n(Fig. 1). This is because both the transformer and coupling \ncapacitor have been used for more than 20 years and cannot be \nregarded as discharge free.   \nFig. 4b presents normalized results of fractal dimension in \neach power cycle with different side lengths of boxes. The \nnumbers in Fig. 4b represent the power cycles’ numbers. From \nthe figure, it can be seen that fractal dimensions from the 1st  to \nthe 3rd  cycles are separated from those of other cycles in most \nof side lengths. The fractal dimension of the 3rd cycle \ncontaining minor noise is close to those from the 4th  to the 10 th  \ncycles. By contrast, fractal dimensions of the 1st  and 2 nd  cycles \ncontaining severe noise are relatively far from those from the \n4th  to the 10 th  cycles. These results can be used for \ndistinguishing and separating PD signals from noise.  \nBy rejecting signals in the first three power cycles and \ncombining the signals in the remaining cycles into one cycle, \nphase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) pattern can be \nobtained (Fig. 4d). PRPD patterns reveal signals distribution \nwith respect to phase angles of applied test voltages [8]. Fig. \n4c is the original PRPD without applying the proposed noise \nremoval method. It can be seen that PD pattern in the original \nPRPD is contaminated by stochastic noise. This demonstrates \nthat the original PRPD cannot fully represent the PD pattern \ncaused by the corresponding insulation defect (i.e. discharge \nwith flat cavity) and thus may not be suitable for transformer \ninsulation diagnosis. \n \n(a) Original signal  \n \n(b) Fractal dimension  \n \n(c) Original phase-resolved partial \ndischarge (PRPD) \n \n(d) Noise-removed phase-resolved \npartial discharge (PRPD)  \nFigure 4.   Noise removal results of discharge with flat cavity. \n(Note: The numbers in Fig. 4b represent power cycles' numbers) \n \nThe results in Fig. 4 prove that fractal dimension used by \nthe proposed method is capable of identifying and removing \nstochastic noise. It can also indicate severity of noise by \ncomparing its value of signal in each power cycle. For those \nsignals that noise is located in every power cycle and the \nsignals themselves have similar values of fractal dimensions, \nentropy is employed to further eliminate the noise. The results \nof applying entropy for removing noise are presented in Fig. 5. \n \n(a) Original signal  \n \n(b) Original signal (magnified)  \n \n(c) Original phase-resolved partial \ndischarge (PRPD) \n \n(d) Noise-removed phase-resolved \npartial discharge (PRPD, magnified)  \nFigure 5.   Noise removal results of corona. \n(Note: In Fig. 5d the pulses in blue color are stochastic noise) \n \nPD signal \nIn Fig. 5, the PD signal is caused by corona (Fig. 2b). \nDuring the measurement, the applied voltage was below 5 kV \nand distance between the needle and grounding was kept at \n50 mm. The purpose of such arrangement is to generate \ncorona with small amplitudes (when compared with the noise) \nfor evaluating performance of the proposed noise removal \nmethod on revealing small-amplitude PD signals. From the \noriginal signal and its magnification (Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b), \nnoise can be observed in most of power cycles. In contrast, \nthe discharge signals (indicated by red arrows, Fig. 5b) are \nhardly identified due to their relatively small amplitudes. \nThough some noise can be identified in some power cycles \nand removed with fractal dimension calculation, other noise \nstill presents in the remaining power cycles (since the signals \nin these power cycles have similar fractal dimension values). \nThrough calculating entropy in each box of fractal dimension \nin each cycle and then combining all entropy values into a \nsingle cycle, noise-removed PRPD is obtained (Fig. 5d). PD \nsignal is clearly identified (the pulses represented by blue \ncolor are stochastic noise). However, in the original PRPD \nwithout applying the proposed noise removal method, PD \nsignal is submerged in noise (Fig. 5c).  \nFig. 6 presents noise removal results on a PD measurement \nperformed for the PD experimental model due to surface \ndischarge (Fig. 2c). It again demonstrates the applicability of \nthe proposed method on removing the stochastic noise and \nextracting PD signals. \n \n(a) Original signal  \n \n(b) Original signal (magnified)  \n \n(c) Original phase-resolved partial \ndischarge (PRPD) \n \n(d) Noise-removed phase-resolved \npartial discharge (PRPD)  \nFigure 6.   Noise removal results of surface discharge. \nIn field PD measurements of transformers, multiple PD \nsources may always co-exist. Therefore, it is necessary to \nevaluate the performance of the proposed method on PD \nmeasurements of multiple PD sources. Fig. 7 presents noise \nremoval results on multiple PD sources, which combine \ndischarge with flat cavity and corona. Fig. 8 presents the \nresults of another multiple PD sources, which combine \ndischarge with flat cavity and surface discharge. It can be seen \nfrom both figures that the propose method can effectively \nremove stocahstic noise while PD signals generated by \nmultiple PD sources can be retrieved.  \n \n(a) Original signal  \n \n(b) Original signal (magnified)  \n \n(c) Original phase-resolved partial \ndischarge (PRPD) \n \n(d) Noise-removed phase-resolved \npartial discharge (PRPD)  \nFigure 7.

Noise Removal Evaluation on a Substation Transformer \nThe proposed method is also applied to extract PD signals \ncollected from a PD measurement on a 5 MVA power \ntransformer with 22 kV test voltage as shown in Fig. 9. \n It can be seen that the original PD signal is immersed in \nnoise and hardly to be identified (Fig. 9a to Fig. 9c). On the \ncontrary, PD signal can be revealed by using the proposed \nmethod (Fig. 9d). The PD signal located near the negative \ncycle may be related to corona, while the PD signal located in \nboth negative and positive cycles may be generated by internal \ndischarge. \n \n \n(a) Original signal \n (b) Original signal (magnified)\n(\nc) Original phase-resolved partial \ndischarge (PRPD) \n(\nd) Noise-removed phase-resolved\npartial discharge (PRPD) \nFigure 9.   Noise removal results of PD signals coll ected from a transformer. \nC. Comparison with a Wavelet Transform-Based Method\nThis paper also compares performance of the proposed\nmethod with that of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-\nbased noise removal method. In DWT, the decomposed \nwavelet coefficients combine an approximation coefficient \nand detail coefficients. The approximation coefficient \ncontains the lowest frequency signal component in an original \nsignal while the detail coefficients contain the other \nfrequency components in different frequency scales. The \ndecomposition results of DWT using different wavelet \nfunctions for a PD signal collected from the experimental \nmodel on discharge with flat cavity (Fig. 2a) is shown in Fig. \n10.  \n(a) Decomposition using db5 (b) Decomposition using bior1.5 \nFigure 10.   Discrete wavelet decomposition using different wavelet \nfunctions for a PD signal generated from discharge with flat cavity. \nThe original signal in Fig. 10 is the same as the signal \npresented in Fig. 4a. The decompositions are based on \nwavelet functions, db5 and bior1.5, which are commonly \nused in removing noise in PD measurements [1], [3], [6]. \nFrom the figure, it can be seen that PD signal cannot be \nseparated from noise in the decomposed coefficients for both \nof the wavelet functions. Since the PD signal and the \nstochastic noise share the same frequency scale, they are \nlocated in the same coefficient after wavelet decomposition. \nAnother reason for the noise cannot be separated from the PD \nsignal is due to their similar pulses’ shapes in which the \nwavelet functions cannot be able to distinguish them during \ndecomposition process [3], [16]. The results indicate that \nwavelet transform-based noise removal method is not suitable \nfor removing stochastic noise. On the contrary, the method \nproposed in this paper can effectively remove severe \nstochastic noise and extract PD signals. \nVI. C\nONCLUSIONS\nT\nhis paper proposes a hybrid of fractal dimension and \nentropy to effectively remove stochastic noise and extract PD \nsignals. This will be beneficial to transformer insulation \ndiagnoses. Future works will be implemented for further \nverification of the proposed method by conducting more PD \nmeasurements on in-service transformers. \nA CKNOWLEDGMENT  \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Australian Research \nCouncil, Powerlink Queensland, Energex, Ergon Energy, and \nTransGrid for providing supports for this work. \nR\nEFERENCES  \n[1] X.
