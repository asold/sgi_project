INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, the Intelligent Assistive Technologies (IAT) may\nassist people (e.g. elderly people with disabilities or brain dis-\norders) to lead a complete and independent life, and according\nto the WHO (World Health Organization) [1], about one\nbillion people need access to programs on improving reha-\nbilitation using assistive technologies. Active aging is the\nprocess by which elderly people are encouraged to remain in\nthe workplace and share their experience with other genera-\ntions. At the same time, it involves encouraging the seniors\nof society to volunteer in various cultural, community and\neconomic activities that contribute to the development of the\ncommunity. Unlike previous decades, the elderly population\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Victor Hugo Albuquerque.\nhas the chance to live longer, which gives it the chance to\nremain active in society to fulﬁll its goals and expectations.\nIn some countries of the European Union, various programs\nare already developed to adapt the professional capacities of\nelderly people in order to be easily integrated into the labor\nmarket or to remain professionally active for a long time.\nDeveloping strategies to promote active aging and intergen-\nerational solidarity will increase between 2010 and 2020,\nbeing one of the main themes of the agenda of the European\nUnion [2]. These strategies will focus on the following objec-\ntives: reducing the barriers imposed on the elderly to the labor\nmarket; changing the attitude regarding the retirement age\nand the retirement period (additional income can be added by\ncontinuing the professional activity); creating an age-friendly\npolicy; changing the perception of older people and their\ncapabilities by younger generations.\n21502\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Gemanet al.: Intelligent Assistive Tool Using Exergaming and RSM for Patients With Brain Disorders\nDementia is not a condition in itself, but a group of man-\nifestations that betray the decline of the mental functions\n(e.g. memory disorders, thinking, language, behavior) that\ncan be produced by a heterogeneous group of diseases and\npathological conditions. In most cases, they are incurable,\ntheir progress worsening over time, and can only be slowed\ndown for a limited period of time. It should be noted from the\noutset that not any such modulation - for example, a decrease\nin memory or its speed of execution - is the sign of dementia,\nbut only when the mental disorders concerned harm daily life\nto the level of loss of independence personal. The disease\noccurs in the vast majority of cases in the elderly. If at 60 years\ndementia affects just over 1% of the population, the number\ndoubles every ﬁve years, so at 85, 40% -50% of people are\naffected by the disease [2]. In the US, 6 million people are\ndiagnosed with dementia, of which 1.5 million have a severe\nform [1]. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s\ndisease, which accounts for 50% -60% of cases [1]. But it\noften happens that a patient has an association of generative\nconditions (e.g. Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia or Parkin-\nson’s disease).\nThe recent developments in Information and Communica-\ntion Technology (ICT) promise an improvement of physical\nand cognitive rehabilitation using therapy based on exergam-\ning and augmented reality [3]–[5]. A serious game uses a plat-\nform that includes a MS Kinect TMsensor added to an Xbox TM\nconsole in order to turn the classic exercise into active video\ngames [6]. The use of the Microsoft Kinect TMsensor has con-\ntributed to opening a way in how user interaction technology\nfacilitates and complements the medical applications includ-\ning physical and cognitive rehabilitation. The therapy using\nexergaming has the potential to help patients with arthritis and\ndisabilities [7], and also elderly patients with dementia.\nIn this work, a Kinect medical rehabilitation platform\nbased on exergaming, is presented. The exergaming is imple-\nmented for upper limb rehabilitation and can be used in\ntherapy-based game for older adults with brain disorders. The\npaper is organized as: Section I presents a short introduction\nabout Intelligent Assistive Technologies, ICT, exergaming\nand therapy-based game for older adults with brain disorders;\nSection II covers the previous research and related papers;\nSection III deals with the methods used in this research\nmeaning the response surface methodology in software tools\noptimization for medical rehabilitation; Section IV presents\nmeasurement system analysis; Section V covers the experi-\nmental results and discussions; Section VI provides the con-\nclusions and future scope of the research.\nII. PREVIOUS RESEARCH\nThe current research in ICT and Internet of Things (IoT) is\nfocused on developing the real-time monitoring of patient’s\nhealth using various intelligent assistive devices [8]. Accord-\ning to authors Da Gama et al. in article [9], a systematic\nresearch was carried out in the IEEE Xplore and PUBMED\ndatabases using the keyword combination ‘‘KINECT and\nrehabilitation’’ and a number of 109 articles were found in\nthe database research, of which 31 were included in the\nreview: 13 were focused on the development of rehabilitation\nassistance systems, 3 on medical recovery assessment, 3 on\napplicability, 7 on KINECT anatomy validation and clinical\nassessment, and 5 on patient’s quality of life improvement\ntechniques [7].\nThe Professor Octavian Postolache (co-author of this\npaper) (see [10]–[20]), from the Institute of Telecommuni-\ncation from Lisbon, Portugal, and his team of researchers\nhave developed and tested applications in the ﬁeld of medical\nrehabilitation within the ‘‘Smart Sensors and Tailored Envi-\nronments for Physiotherapy’’ project [10].\nThe overarching objective of our research (see [21]–[26]),\nwas the development of new and unique clinically sys-\ntems for monitoring, staging, and screening of Parkinson’s\nDisease (PD) patients, because currently, there is no\nclinically approved automatic system for PD monitoring.\nEEG and tremor signals, handwriting, gait and video infor-\nmation were combined for PD diagnosis, therapy, and reha-\nbilitation. Chiuchisan et al. [21] presented ‘‘a system for\nNeurological Disorders Screening and Rehabilitation that\nmanages data acquired from patients with Parkinson’s dis-\nease in order to support physicians in diagnosis, treatment,\nand home-monitoring and also to facilitate the interaction\nat distance between specialists and patients’’ [21]. Another\nhealthcare system for monitoring patients at fall risk in a\nsmart environment that can be used in an Intensive Care\nUnit, was presented in [22] and [23], ‘‘The system included\nan intensive care unit bedside monitors in order to monitor\nand record multiple physiological parameters of patients, the\nMS Kinect sensors to monitor the movement of the patients to\neliminate the situations in which the patient has removed from\nthe sensing devices wires or to eliminate the false alarms,\nthe sensor board for monitoring of environmental parameters\nsuch as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and dif-\nferent types of gases [23]’’ (ﬁgure 1).\nIII. METHODS - RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY\nIN SOFTWARE TOOLS OPTIMIZATION FOR MEDICAL\nREHABILITATION\nThe proposed methodology used in the work is based on\nResponse Surface Methodology, described in [27]. This\nmethod is very often used in industry, in the optimization\nof technological processes [28], for example in the pharma-\nceutical industry and its application in medicine represents\na novelty. In the paper ‘‘Response Surface Model Prediction\nof Deep Brain Stimulation Applied in Parkinson’s Disease\nTremor’’ [29], we proposed a model using RSM that choose\nthe best target for DBS in order to reduce the Parkinson’s\ntremor. ‘‘The results obtained with RSM guides us to ﬁnd\nthe best model for the kernel in which DBS will be made\nbased on the input variables (tremor, frequency, and location\namplitude). This mathematical model may be helpful for\nmedical doctors and researchers. The proposed model shows\nother way of predicting and diagnosis the DBS results with\na use of data mining techniques. The RSM proves to be the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 21503\nO. Gemanet al.: Intelligent Assistive Tool Using Exergaming and RSM for Patients With Brain Disorders\nFIGURE 1. Healthcare system architecture for remote-monitoring in a smart environment [22].\neffective tool for the development of a mathematical model\nfor DBS target evaluation model. Further, this work can be\nextended to other neurological disorders’’ [29]. The Response\nSurface Methodology (RSM) ‘‘involves a combination of\nmeta-modeling (i.e., regression) and sequential procedures\n(iterative optimization)’’ [28].\nIn this paper, we present a medical recovery application\nimplemented for upper limb rehabilitation, using a Kinect\nplatform. The user’s avatar pass through an orchard with\napples and has to picks up red or green apples according to\ntheir level. Green apples are positioned at the base of trees,\nand red apples to the top. The game is 3D and during the game\ndifferent angles of inclination of the neck, hand, shoulder, etc.\nare measured and a ﬁnal score is generated. To ﬁnd if the\npatient has progressed in his medical recovery, the ﬁnal score\nshould be increased. In order to ﬁnd the score that a subject\nwithout a locomotor system disorder can achieve, we have\noptimized the game using mathematical modeling and canon-\nical analysis by applying Response Surface Methodology\n(RSM) and Multiple Nonlinear Regression, using the Expert\nDesign experimental software package (vers. 11). Compared\nto a polynomial model which allows the calculation of the\nresponse but does not give a slightly visible or intelligible\nrepresentation of the surface of response, the method of\nresponse area allows ﬁnding the favorable value of a response\n(in our case the software optimization). Canonical analysis\ncan reduce the estimated regression equation to a simpler\nform and interpret the resulting expression using geometric\nconcepts. Areas that are functions of two variables can be\neasily represented in three-dimensional space, and the answer\nwill be given by the value of the function.\nSurfaces that depend on three or more variables can be pro-\njected into three-dimensional space, maintaining all variables\nconstantly, with the exception of two of them whose variance\nis considered essential for the chosen model. Extreme points\n(maximum and minimum) of the surface is of particular\ntechnological interest because it shows the performance of\nthe model chosen for process optimization.\nThe RSM, detailed in [29], is ‘‘a set of mathemati-\ncal and statistical techniques that explore the relationship\nbetween independent and variable-response variables in order\nto optimize the desired response of the investigated system\nto explore optimal operating conditions’’ [29]. For many\nRSM studies, the central compound experiment and also the\nTaguchi method [30], are used.\nThe optimization process using the RSM, illustrated\nin ﬁgure 2, is a sequential procedure and is presented in [29].\nFor the optimization of our proposed algorithm, it was taken\ninto account that the input variables were the avatars’ inclina-\ntion angles and the output variable were the scores obtained\n(the number of apples gathered). The results show that the\nbest scores are obtained when the input angles are taken from\nthe arms, column, and neck.\nFor our application of the RSM, it is necessary to use exper-\nimental projects, often using the central compound experi-\nment: (1) a set of factorial experiments, (2) a set of central\npoints and (3) a set of axial points. The center points have\nvalues equal to the median values used in the set of factorial\nexperiments, while the set of axial points implies points out-\nside the range of the points of the factorial experiments for all\nfactors. As an alternative to the central compound experiment,\nthe Box-Behnken experiment can be chosen.\nIn this paper, the response surface method was used\nin order to optimize the initial conditions to improve the\nfunctional properties of the medical recovery application.\nThis experiment requires lower costs, but should only be\nused if it is assumed that the boundaries of the experiment\nare known. In the process of designing and analyzing the\nresponse surface experiments we used the: Design-Expert and\nStatgraphics.\nRSM is useful for programs modeling and analysis in\nwhich a response of interest is inﬂuenced by several variables\n21504 VOLUME 7, 2019\nO.

MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS\nSpecialty studies have shown that stimulating cognitive abil-\nities helps slow down disease progression, limiting the loss\nof neurological abilities and functions. The best result of\nAlzheimer’s treatment by the serious gaming method was\nseen in patients with mild or moderate disease symptoms.\nSerious games are also called ‘‘training games’’. They are\ndesigned not for fun but for cognitive stimulation. It can\nbe said that some games maybe included in the category of\nmodern and useful therapeutic solutions. The study published\nVOLUME 7, 2019 21505\nO. Gemanet al.: Intelligent Assistive Tool Using Exergaming and RSM for Patients With Brain Disorders\nFIGURE 6. User interface: the diagram for the hypothesis test (capture from Minitab 18 software).\nFIGURE 7. Frequencies for angles and for the final score (capture from data analysis tools).\nby Psychological Science [31], a periodical journal of the\nPsychology Association, shows that some of the games, espe-\ncially those based on action, can stimulate players’ ability\nto coordinate visual information with better control of motor\nfunctions (ﬁgure 3). The utility of these beneﬁts starts from\nthe development of the skills to drive a car. But they are\nalso useful for those who have motor coordination prob-\nlems due to illness. Games are useful to those with mul-\ntiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, balance-related disorders and\nmore.\nTo implement mathematical models to optimize the recov-\nery software, we used the DOE Expert Design Software\nPackage (vers. 11), Minitab 18, and for descriptive statis-\ntics, we used IBM SPSS (vers. 25). The data acquired by\nthe developed software contains the following information\nand variables: sessions_ID, red_apple, gree_apple, timeamp,\nbody_parts_ID, angle, lelbow, lsholder, relbow, rshoulder,\nneck, spine and score .\nThe ﬁrst stage is the experimental part that was performed\nto extract the dataset. The next step is the modeling of the\n21506 VOLUME 7, 2019\nO. Gemanet al.: Intelligent Assistive Tool Using Exergaming and RSM for Patients With Brain Disorders\nFIGURE 8.

This information can be used for further comparisons,\nclustering, and classiﬁcation in order to identify certain dis-\neases, including neurodegenerative diseases. The next stage\npresents the model prediction corrections that were evaluated\nusing several statistical indicators, such as the determination\ncoefﬁcient and the square square error (RMSE). The variance\nanalysis (ANOV A) on RSM was used to check any signiﬁcant\nlack of matching [31]. In the ﬁnal stage, we aim to extrapolate\nthe developed models and the RSM models will be evaluated\nfor new data sets.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 21507\nO. Gemanet al.: Intelligent Assistive Tool Using Exergaming and RSM for Patients With Brain Disorders\nFIGURE 10. Multiple regression for score – summary report.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nIn the ﬁrst step, data types were deﬁned and the basic Graph-\nical Summary statistics were made. Then we used statistical\nelements appropriate to large datasets, such as Descriptive\nstatistics, Inferential statistics, Normal distribution . Thus,\nthe links between the variables and their inﬂuence on the\nﬁnal outcome of the algorithm have been identiﬁed. To test\nhypotheses and to ﬁnd conﬁdence intervals, Minitab soft-\nware provides tools such as: Testing the Null Hypothesis and\nthe Alternative Hypothesis (H0 and H1), Alpha Calculation,\nP-Value, Finding Type I and II Errors, 1 -Sample t-Test,\n2 Variances Test, 2-Sample t-Test, Paired t-Test, 1 Proportion\nTest, 2 Proportions Test, Chi-Square Test.\nIn tables, 1 is presented the datasets for men, with\n1012 records, and women, with 1062 records.\nIn ﬁgures 4 and 5 are the scores obtained by the men par-\nticipating in the study, depending on the angles of the spine\nand neck.\nAfter performing the experiments and obtaining the\nmathematical model associated with the factorial exper-\niments, some statistical hypothesis checks are required\n(ﬁgure 6):\n- Verifying the homogeneity of the dispersions obtained\nat the repetition of the experiments, which is achieved\nwith the Cochran criteria;\n- Checking the degree of statistical signiﬁcance of the\nregression coefﬁcients, with the Student criterion;\n- Check the adequacy degree of the mathematical model\nusing the Fisher criterion.\nIf the Fisher criterion shows that the linear mathematical\nmodel is inadequate, then the factor variation intervals (in\nview of a new experiment) are reduced, or a second-order\nfactorial experimental program is built for a series of new\nexperiments. Figure 7 presents the frequencies for angles and\nfor the ﬁnal score.\nThe square mean deviation parameter can also be\nexpressed in a relative form, the case is called the Pearson\nvariation coefﬁcient, and is denoted by Vx . Pearson’s variance\ncoefﬁcient calculated for two or more series can be used in\ncomparative estimates of the degree of the calculated mean\nvalue (ﬁgure 8).\nBecause the degree of the mean value is inversely pro-\nportional to Pearson’s variance coefﬁcient, it can be stated\nin several series that the mean value of that series for\nwhich Vx is lower and so more representative. In conclu-\nsion, it should be noted that the mean square deviation\nparameter in absolute form σx and in relative form Vx are\nfundamental indicators used to measure the variance of a\nvariable.\nStatistical dependence of the study factors necks and spine,\nas well as a separate inﬂuence but and conjugated of them on\nthe score are set with the veriﬁcation of statistical hypothe-\nses of independence, using tests of type Chi-square and\nFisher, based on observation data (values measured from\nexperiments) grouped in ﬁgure 9. We used the software\npackage Expert design which determines the calculated val-\nues and test tables corresponding to Chi-square and Fisher .\nOn the basis of these assumptions of independence, the\n21508 VOLUME 7, 2019\nO.

Statistics for men and women.\ntwo variables (study factors of angles) and, both individual\nand simultaneous inﬂuences variables on the ﬁnal score, can\nbe accepted with the assured risk, respectively rejected with\nprecision (p =0.95 in general).\nThe regression function obtained by the minimum square’s\nmethod may be a more or less efﬁcient adjustment of the\ncloud point distribution (ﬁgures 10 and 11). The more cloud\npoints are closer to the regression line, the better the adjust-\nment. To measure it numerically, we appeal to variance anal-\nysis (ANOV A - Analysis of Variance).\nA series of tests were designed to carefully evaluate the\nresponse (output of the model) as a function of variations of\nthe input variables ( angle, lelbow, lsholder, relbow, rshoulder,\nneck, spine- see table 1) (ﬁgure 12).\nThe advantage of RSM is that it uses a minimal amount of\nexperimental data to develop a model for obtaining a model\nscore (for subjects without neuromuscular damage) with a\nhigh level of precision. The RSM shape the effect of the\nvarious variables of the input process, both on the main effects\nand on the interaction, on the output variable of the process,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 21509\nO.

Pareto chart of the standardized effects.\nin our case the score for subsequent comparisons on groups\nof neuro-muscular disorders. To optimize the exergaming\nfor rehabilitation we used this methodology depending on\ninput variables and patient score. In this case, we studied the\ninﬂuence of two variables, the neck, and spine, on several\nindicators: angle, lelbow, lsholder, relbow, rshoulder , acting\nin the response function, meaning the ﬁnal score obtained by\nthe patient (ﬁgure 13).\nIn our study, a speciﬁc RSM model, called CCD, was\nused to determine the experimental conditions because the\ncomplexity required for the software model was not known\nfor the exact predictions. This design allows the use of a\nwider range of conditions [32], [33], compared to other\nRSM techniques [31]. An RSM experimental array based\non three factors considered was generated using the Design\nExpertsoftware and Minitab.\nThe project included 30 rounds, consisting of 10 axial\npoints, 15 factorial points, and 10 central points. The score\nfunction of the resulting solution was then modeled using a\nsquare equation:\nz =a +bx +cy +dx2 +ey2 +fxy (6)\nFIGURE 14. The residual plots for score.\nFIGURE 15. The contour plot of body parts vs. neck, score.\nIn order to check our residuals (our error terms) to see if our\nequation works well for all predicted values or if our equation\nworks really well at predicting low-quality ratings but works\npoorly for predicting high-quality ratings. There are all sorts\nof different residual analyses that could be done. Two of\nthem are particularly helpful – Histogram and Residual vs.\nﬁts – contained on the ‘Four in one’ Graph. The encoded\ndesign variables have been used to perform all analyzes and\nthe model created for a CCD. The numerical results will\nbe different and often it will be more difﬁcult to interpret\nthe results compared to the coded unit analysis. Moreover,\nin the coded variable analysis, the comparison of the effect\nof changing each design factor within a single unit interval\ncan be easily achieved by checking the magnitude of the\ncoefﬁcients of the obtained model [31]. In this study, each\nindependent parameter was encoded in ﬁve levels ( −1,5, −1,\n0, 1 and 1,5), according to equation:\nxi =(xi −x0)/1x (7)\nwhere x0 to xi are the selected parameters at the center point\nand 1X is the step change.\nThe ﬁgures 14 and 15 illustrate a plot of the values\npredicted by the RSM model according to the measured\nexperimental data. Choosing this mathematical model of the\nresponse function offers the advantage that it allows easy\n21510 VOLUME 7, 2019\nO.

The Chi-square apply for\nhigh volume selections (number of values of observation of\nthe factors whose independence/dependency is investigated:\nN > 1500). If 1000 < N < 15400, and the contingency\ntable does not contain expected counts with values less than 5,\nthen the application Chi-square is also valid. If N < 1000\nand the contingency table contains no more than 20% of the\nexpected count with the values between 1 and 5, then the\nFisher test is preferable to Chi-square test. The df value (free\ndegree number) represents the number of degrees of freedom\nin relation to which it is determined to test tab values.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThe study presented in this paper has proved that the\nResponse Surface Methodology (RSM) is a successful tool\nin the prediction of the variable score. In order to evaluate the\nprediction capacity of the developed models, several statisti-\ncal indicators were used. A CCD project, as a speciﬁc design\nof RSM, was chosen to determine the experimental condi-\ntions. In terms of prediction of the test score in the design\nintervals, a high coefﬁcient (R2) of 99.2 percent was obtained\nfor the RSM model, demonstrating a great precision of the\nmodel. In conclusion, the Response Surface Methodology\ncan be a valuable solution for some types of problems that,\ngenerally, fall into three categories: (1) Mapping a Response\nSurface over a Particular Region of Interest; (2) Optimization\nof the Response and (3) Selection of Operating Conditions\nto Achieve Speciﬁcations or Customer Requirements. In this\nwork, a medical recovery game that uses a Kinect platform is\npresented. The exergaming is designed and implemented for\nupper limb rehabilitation and can be used in therapy-based\ngame for older adults with brain disorders.\nREFERENCES\n[1] WHO Guidelines on Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) , World\nHealth Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, 2017.\n[2] (Feb. 15, 2018).
