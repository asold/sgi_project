    "abstract": "With the rapid development of science and technology as well as the comprehensive societal progress, the demand for electricity in all walks of life is also increasing. As is known to all, the mechanical structure and tension control of a transformer winding machine is the key to improving the quality of coil winding, due to coil winding being generally considered the core technology of transformer manufacturing. Aiming at the synchronous winding control problem of the conductor and insulating layer of the transformer winding machine, this paper presents a mechanical structure and tension control scheme of a new type of transformer winding machine. Based on the dynamic analysis and modeling of the mechanical structure of the winding machine, the speed control of the main speed roller by the fuzzy PID control rate is implemented initially. Combined with the actual demand of the project, the feasibility and effectiveness of the control target with different tension are verified by the simulation experiment and further compared with the traditional PID control method. The simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy PID control rate can realize the automatic and efficient winding of the transformer winding machine, showing that it is superior to the traditional PID control rate in overcoming the disturbance and controlling effect.",
