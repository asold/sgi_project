But there is a problem. Chat-GPT does not ask questions to the\nusers. Therefore, Chat-GPT looks like a machine, not a human. However, users sometimes do not want a single\nanswer. They want real things like food, cars, products, etc. Therefore, our system will ask users questions several\ntimes until they get what they really want.

In the future, the\ndataset can be integrated into webtext2 as a basic data element to connect the model training.\nJun Wang\n80Hou International Software LLC\nArizona State University\n \nIntroduction\n70 years ago, Alan Turing made assumptions about how to tell whether an AI is successful or not. The Turing test is a\nresearch method in artificial intelligence (AI) to determine whether a computer can think like a human. As a result, humans\ncan talk to AI. If humans cannot distinguish between humans and AI, who they are talking to. So, this means that AI is like\na human(Saha, D., Brooker, P., Mair, M., & Reeves, S., 2023). But even today, humans have powerful computers,\ngraphics processors, advanced algorithms and intelligent, trained models. Humans can still easily judge who they are\ntalking to, a human or an AI. Therefore, we believe that AI is a reasonably mature technology. Today, Chat-GPT has made\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n1\n/\n14\nsignificant progress. Chat GPT not only provides the user with an accurate answer, but can also provide them with very\nspecific services, such as generating code for the programmer (Ray, P. P., 2023). As a result, more and more people are\nusing Chat-GPT instead of Google. In today’s world, we cannot yet provide users with complete AI products due to the\nlimitations of technology. Therefore, the current AI and machine learning will combine some technologies from the Internet\nera to serve users as much as possible. Based on this situation, the project chooses Java, Spring-Boot, MySQL and\nPython to combine the API of OpenAI, which can provide the maximum utilization of current technologies for users.\nRelated work\nThe project does not only require AI or machine learning skills such as Python, Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. Skills other\nthan AI such as Java, Spring-Boot and AWS must also be included in the project.\nPython\nPython has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks specifically designed for machine learning and data science.\nLibraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib and especially scikit-learn provide robust tools for data manipulation,\nanalysis, visualization and model building. Python is the primary language for many popular deep learning frameworks\nsuch as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras. These frameworks provide efficient implementations of deep learning algorithms\nand enable easy experimentation with complex neural network architectures(Liu, Y. H., 2020).\nJava and Spring-Boot\nIn this project we have to build an enterprise system. Java and Spring-Boot form the core of our system. Java is known for\nits robustness and reliability and is therefore suitable for the development of complex and mission-critical applications. Its\nstrong typing system, memory management and exception handling contribute to the creation of stable and maintainable\nsoftware(de Oliveira, C. E., Turnquist, G. L., & Antonov, A., 2018). Java's scalability has proven itself and makes it a\npreferred choice for developing applications that need to handle high loads and scale horizontally. Java applications can\nrun efficiently on a variety of platforms and architectures and are therefore suitable for use in different environments.\nSpring Boot, a microservices-focused framework based on the Spring Framework, has gained popularity for the\ndevelopment of microservices-based applications. It simplifies the setup and configuration of microservices and allows\ndevelopers to focus on the business logic rather than the infrastructure(de Oliveira, C. E., Turnquist, G. L., & Antonov, A.,\n2018).\nAWS\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud computing platforms offering a wide range of services to\nindividuals, businesses and governments. AWS offers elastic scaling, allowing users to quickly scale their infrastructure up\nor down as needed. This scalability is particularly useful for applications with fluctuating traffic patterns or unpredictable\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n2\n/\n14\nworkloads. AWS places great emphasis on security and compliance, offering a wide range of tools and features to help\nusers protect their data and infrastructure. These include identity and access management (IAM), encryption, network\nsecurity, monitoring and compliance certifications. Based on these situations, we deploy the project in AWS and then\nprovide services to users(Gupta, B., Mittal, P., & Mufti, T, 2021).\nResearch Questions\nIn the projects, we have three questions that need to be answered.\nChat-GPT won’t ask questions to users\nWhen the user asks the first question, the Chat-GPT will answer it, and then the dialog process will be paused until the\nuser asks another question. There is one problem: if we care about the users, we also have to care about what they need.\nSometimes they need products and services. So, they ask questions to Chat-GPT. An example: A user wants to buy a\ncar. The user asks the question where I can buy a car in San Jose. And then Chat-GPT only gives the user an answer.\nThat ends the dialog. But if you go to a real car dealership, the agent will ask the user several questions, such as what\nkind of car do you like? How many budgets do you have? Or how many family members do you have? There are a series\nof questions that combine what you need. On the surface, Chat-GPT gives you wonderful answers, but right now Chat-\nGPT lacks features that focus on the user’s needs. This is because Chat-GPT cannot ask questions to users (Zhong,\nQihuang, Liang Ding, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, and Dacheng Tao, 2023). To solve this project, we build the application using\ntraditional applications such as Java, Spring-Boot and MySQL. We use Java programming logic to store the user’s\nquestion. And we can find the answer in our database.\nRisk question\nThis is a problem study of the ethical concerns surrounding ChatGPT and other advanced language models (LLMs). They\nargue that while LLMs have impacted various industries, including texting and summarization software, they can create\nsocial biases and toxicity that pose moral and societal risks(Kocoń, J., Cichecki, I., Kaszyca, O., Kochanek, M., Szydło, D.,\nBaran, J.,... & Kazienko, P., 2023). Based on these situations, Chat-GPT will not give you an answer. Or it gives users\nvery vague answers or tips like I am an AI model, I cannot answer such questions. However, users found that some\nnormal questions are still considered risky questions. The authors investigated the ethical dimensions of ChatGPT,\nincluding bias, reliability, toxicity, and robustness, through experimental evaluations on several sample datasets. We found\nthat the current benchmarks cannot adequately address a significant portion of the ethical concerns, so we provided\nadditional case studies to shed light on them. Therefore, the additional system can be considered a good choice to\naddress this issue.\nOutdated information\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n3\n/\n14\nCurrently Chat-GPT uses webtext2 as the dataset. Webtext2 is not real-time text. Therefore, the model does not have\naccess to real-time data or the ability to update the knowledge base beyond the last training cut-off date in January\n2022(Yang, J., Jin, H., Tang, R., Han, X., Feng, Q., Jiang, H.,... & Hu, X, 2023). Although Chat-GPT strives to provide\naccurate and relevant information based on the data on which Chat-GPT has been trained, the information provided by\nChatGPT may be outdated or no longer accurate due to changes that have occurred since the model was last updated.\nTherefore, users must verify the information with current sources, especially for time-sensitive or rapidly changing topics.\nOur system can provide real-time data to users. Some real-time APIs can be integrated into the Java service logic. This\nallows it to handle some responses in real time that ChatGPT cannot.\nProcess and Methodology\nStep1: UI\nIn the project, the user interface is similar to that of any chat software such as WhatsApp or WeChat. In the chat\napplication. Users send their messages on the right side. Your friend’s reply to their message is on the right-hand side.\nMessage senders and recipients have different colored message fields. Autonomy's QA system still uses this kind of user\ninterface. The only difference is that the message sent by autonomy AI. In our project, AI combines the model of Chat-\nGPT with the Java ecosystem, which provides an additional intelligent system to enforce the model of Chat-GPT.\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n4\n/\n14\nFigure 1.\nStep 2: Build system based on Java\nA Java Spring-Boot application was created to enforce the Chat-GPT model. We still use the 3-Ties layer such as\nController, Service, and Dao to handle the user’s request. In the controller layer, there is a function that receives prompts\nfrom the front page, e.g. Html and JavaScript.\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n5\n/\n14\nFigure 2.\nIn the services we deal with some business logic. Here, there are two main functions getAnswerfromChatGPT (String\nprompt). In this function Java calls the API of OpenAI and then gets a result. Another function is findFivePopularQuestion\n(String prompt, String answer). Based on this function, our system returns five questions to answer the users’ queries.\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n6\n/\n14\nFigure 3.\nThe OpenAI API is still called via the traditional channels. The system must obtain permission from OpenAI, such as URL,\napikey and model. The project uses Java to generate the HTTP request and response that go through the OpenAI API.\nFigure 4.\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n7\n/\n14\nFigure 4.\nStep 3: database to build dataset\nCREATE TABLE Users (\n    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    Password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    Phone VARCHAR(20),\n    Address VARCHAR(255),\n    DateJoined DATE NOT NULL\n);\nCREATE TABLE QuestionAndAnswer (\n    QuestionID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    UserID INT NOT NULL,\n    QuestionText TEXT NOT NULL,\n    AnswerText TEXT NOT NULL,\n    DateAsked DATE NOT NULL,\n    DateAnswered DATE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)\n);\nBased on these two tables, the user dataset can be created. And then we can use Python to train the model using this\ndataset.\nStep 4: deploy system into AWS\nThere are several advantages to storing applications in AWS:\nScalability: \nWith AWS, users can easily scale their application as needed. Users can dynamically adjust resources to\nhandle increased or decreased workloads without having to make significant upfront hardware investments(Wittig,\nAndreas, and Michael Wittig, 2023).\nFlexibility: \nAWS provides a wide range of services, including compute power, storage options, databases, machine\nlearning, analytics and more. This flexibility allows users to choose the specific services that meet the needs of their\napplication(Wittig, Andreas, and Michael Wittig, 2023)\n.\nCost efficiency: \nAWS works on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for the resources user use. This can be\nmore cost-effective than maintaining and managing physical hardware, especially for small and medium-sized\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n8\n/\n14\nbusinesses(Wittig, Andreas, and Michael Wittig, 2023).\nGlobal accessibility: \nAWS has data centers (regions) around the world. This global infrastructure allows users to deploy\ntheir application close to them, reducing latency and improving performance for a global user base(Wittig, Andreas, and\nMichael Wittig, 2023).\nReliability and availability: \nAWS offers high availability and reliability through redundant and geographically distributed\ndata centers. This ensures that users application remains available even in the event of hardware failures or other\nproblems(Wittig, Andreas, and Michael Wittig, 2023).\nSecurity: \nAWS offers a robust set of security features and compliance certifications. AWS invests heavily in security\nmeasures to protect data and infrastructure and provides tools to help you secure your applications(Wittig, Andreas, and\nMichael Wittig, 2023).\nFigure 5.\nSystem architecture\nIn the high-level architecture, users send the query or request to the Autonomy Question Answer System. When the\nsystem has completed the validation, it calls three parts. First, the system calls Chat-GPT to get the first answer. In the\nsecond part, the system will make a recommendation. Since Chat-GPT cannot answer real-time or risk questions, the\nrecommendation system will answer such questions. To solve outdated information, the system can call Quora or Watson\nDiscovery API to get the latest answer(Das, D., & Semaan, B., 2020).\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n9\n/\n14\nFigure 6.\nThis high-level architecture uses a distributed system to ensure high availability when many users access the system\nsimultaneously. First, the user request goes through load balancing and is then forwarded to the Autonomy Question\nAnswer System running on AWS EC2. The Redis cluster stores the hot data from the question and answer. If the system\ncannot retrieve the answer from Redis. It calls Chat-GPT4, a recommendation system and an AI-driven API. The answer\nand question are sent back to the user. The cluster database instance is configured and deployed behind the\nrecommendation system to make the dataset as large as possible. The dataset is trained with another Python project.\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n10\n/\n14\nFigure 7.\nThe Impact of Autonomy QA System Across Different Fields\nIn the current situation, Chat-GPT cannot customize the content of a specific area. Due to the training, the new model\nrequires new data sets, and the maintenance and cleanup of such data sets is required at least monthly or annually. For\nthese reasons, the training of Chat-GPT is slower. For example, Chat-GPT's model has used a dataset like webtext2 until\n2024, which is based on the 2021 version. The Autonomy QA system can therefore be used in various fields such as\nbanks, telecommunications companies and Internet companies. It will combine Chat- GPT to provide real-time and more\naccurate information. In addition, the system can still be used in the following areas(Roumeliotis, K. I., & Tselikas, N. D.,\n2023):\nCustomer service and support: \nThe Autonomy QA System is often used in customer service chatbots to handle\nrequests, provide assistance and solve problems. Its ability to understand natural language makes it an effective tool for\nengaging with customers and providing them with relevant information(Wang, J., Liang, Y., Meng, F., Sun, Z., Shi, H., Li,\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n11\n/\n14\nZ.,... & Zhou, J., 2023).\nResearch and information retrieval: \nThe\n \nAutonomy QA System can help researchers by summarizing articles,\nanswering research questions and generating hypotheses. It is also used for information retrieval tasks by helping users\nfind relevant information from large data sets or document repositories(Wei, X., Cui, X., Cheng, N., Wang, X., Zhang, X.,\nHuang, S.,... & Han, W., 2023).\nLegal assistance: \nThe Autonomy QA System can assist you with legal research, drafting legal documents and providing\nlegal advice. It is used by law firms, legal departments and lawyers to optimize their workflows and increase\nefficiency(Ray, P. P., 2023).\nSocial media and marketing: \nThe Autonomy QA System is used in social media management tools, chatbots and\nmarketing automation platforms to engage with users, create content and analyze social media trends(Roumeliotis, K. I.,\n& Tselikas, N. D., 2023).\nProspects for Autonomy QA Applications\nToday, Chat-GPT spends 700,000 dollars per day, the revenues cannot compensate for the daily costs. Many investor\nrepresentatives predict that OpenAI will be bankrupt in 2024. Thanks to Autonomy QA system, which can be customized,\nAutonomy QA system can be integrated with Amazon Order, Quora and Reddit API to generate some successful\nbusiness models and get the full revenue. There are several other areas that can be integrated with the Autonomy QA\nsystem(Roumeliotis, K. I., & Tselikas, N. D., 2023).\nDevelopment of chatbot solutions: \nUsers can create chatbot solutions based on the Autonomy QA system and sell\nthem to companies in various industries. These chatbots can be used for customer service, lead generation, sales support\nand more. By charging companies for access to your chatbot solutions, you can generate revenue(Kalla, D., & Smith, N.,\n2023).\nContent creation services: \nOffer content creation services to individuals and businesses. Use the Autonomy QA system\nto create articles, blog posts, social media content, product descriptions and other written content. Charge your customers\nfor each piece of content created or offer subscription plans for ongoing content needs(Wu, T., He, S., Liu, J., Sun, S., Liu,\nK., Han, Q. L., & Tang, Y., 2023).\nCustomized AI solutions: \nDevelop customized AI solutions tailored to specific business needs with the Autonomy QA\nsystem. This could include the development of AI-driven virtual assistants, personalized recommendation systems,\nlanguage translation services or sentiment analysis tools. Charge your customers for the development and\nimplementation of these solutions(Wu, T., He, S., Liu, J., Sun, S., Liu, K., Han, Q. L., & Tang, Y., 2023).\nProductivity tools and plugins: \nDevelop productivity tools, plugins or extensions that leverage the Autonomy QA\nSystem to streamline workflows, automate tasks or improve communication. Offer these tools as paid products or as part\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n12\n/\n14\nof a subscription-based service for individuals and businesses(Wu, T., He, S., Liu, J., Sun, S., Liu, K., Han, Q. L., & Tang,\nY., 2023).\nLimitations\nAlthough the Autonomy QA system and similar AI language systems have made considerable progress, they still have\nsome limitations:\nDependence ChatGPT: \nThe Autonomy QA system relies on a large corpus of text data for training. The quality, variety\nand size of this data have a significant impact on the performance and behavior of the model. The data should be\nrepresentative of the language and contexts that the model is likely to encounter during inference(Wang, J., Liang, Y.,\nMeng, F., Sun, Z., Shi, H., Li, Z.,... & Zhou, J., 2023).\nSoftware libraries and frameworks: \nThe autonomous QA system is usually implemented using Java and frameworks\nsuch as Spring or Spring-Boot. These frameworks provide the necessary tools and libraries for the creation, training and\nuse of AI models(Wang, J., Liang, Y., Meng, F., Sun, Z., Shi, H., Li, Z.,... & Zhou, J., 2023).\nInfrastructure and deployment environment: \nThe Autonomy QA system requires a suitable infrastructure and\ndeployment environment in order to work efficiently. This includes hardware infrastructure, cloud services, containerization\nplatforms or server configurations(Wang, J., Liang, Y., Meng, F., Sun, Z., Shi, H., Li, Z.,... & Zhou, J., 2023).\nMaintenance and updates: \nThe Autonomy QA System requires to be regularly maintained, updated and improved to\nensure it remains effective and up to date. This may include retraining the model with new data, fine-tuning parameters or\nincorporating new techniques from AI research(Yang, J., Jin, H., Tang, R., Han, X., Feng, Q., Jiang, H.,... & Hu, X, 2023).\nAPIs and external services: \nThe Autonomy QA System can make use of external APIs or services for additional\nfunctions, such as language translation, sentiment analysis or content retrieval(Wu, T., He, S., Liu, J., Sun, S., Liu, K.,\nHan, Q. L., & Tang, Y., 2023).\nConclusion\nThis paper provides a solution to complement some drawbacks of using Chat-GPT, a popular AI model for QA in today’s\nworld. The Autonomy QA system not only answers the questions but can also ask users five questions related to the\nuser's first question. When the user selects one of these five questions, the autonomy QA system can answer the\nquestion and ask five more questions until the user stops. Finally, the autonomous QA system can provide\nrecommendations to the user, such as blogs from Quora or Reddit, products from Amazon API or videos from YouTube.\nAll this content can simplify the whole process for the user’s question. Based on these solutions, OpenAI's Chat-GPT API\ncannot provide all the content itself. Therefore, Java and Spring-Boot are used in the Autonomy QA system to call the API\nof Quora, Amazon and YouTube. The user’s behavior is stored in the Autonomy QA system. The recommendation system\nQeios, CC-BY 4.0   ·   Article, \nMarch 17, 2024\nQeios ID: 3N00OC   ·   https://doi.org/10.32388/3N00OC\n13\n/\n14\nbehind the Autonomy QA System will use a cluster of MySQL database instances to support large amounts of data. This\ndata is used to train new models on a regular basis. All in all, the Autonomy QA System can be seen as a complementary\nsystem to the current AI model system(de Oliveira, C. E., Turnquist, G.
