Hence, it is an\nimportant tool in studying receptor-ligand interactions\nand plays an essential role in drug design. Particularly,\nmolecular docking has been used as an effective virtual\nscreening tool and successfully applied in a number of\ntherapeutic programs at the lead discovery stage [1].\nPublished: 8 September 2008\nChemistry Central Journal 2008, 2:18 doi:10.1186/1752-153X-2-18\nReceived: 3 July 2008\nAccepted: 8 September 2008\nThis article is available from: http://journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/2/1/18\n© 2008 Jiang et al \nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nChemistry Central Journal 2008, 2:18 http://journal.chemistryc entral.com/content/2/1/18\nPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAutoDock [2,3] is a broadly used docking program. Previ-\nously, we developed a Linux cluster-based application\ntermed DOVIS [4], which runs in parallel on hundreds of\ncentral processing units (CPUs), uses AutoDock 3.05 as\nthe docking engine, and docks large numbers (millions)\nof ligands to a target receptor. It automatically partitions\ninput ligands, prepares parameter files for AutoDock,\nlaunches parallel AutoDock runs, parses results, and saves\na set of top-ranking docked ligands. DOVIS removes\nmany technical complexities and organizational prob-\nlems associated with large-scale high-throughput virtual\nscreening.\nDuring the execution of a number of large-scale virtual\nscreening campaigns using the DOVIS software, we iden-\ntified four critical areas in which to enhance the software:\n1) improving parallelization efficiency, 2) minimizing file\noperations on a common file system, 3) interfacing with\nother modeling programs, and 4) facilitating rescoring of\nligand-receptor complexes using third-party software.\nFirst, in our original parallelization scheme, ligands are\nevenly distributed to each CPU, i.e., each available CPU\nreceives a number of ligands to dock that is equal to the\ntotal number of ligands divided by the number of CPUs\nrequested in the batch-queuing job. This scheme is not\nefficient if the queuing system does not make all CPUs\navailable at the same time, as in jobs submitted under the\n\"job-array\" queuing option, or if the computational time\nthat it takes to dock a ligand is systematically biased\nbecause of compound differences, resulting in unbal-\nanced load distribution for each computer node. There-\nfore, a scheme that automatically balances computational\nloads across all available CPUs is highly desirable. Sec-\nond, during docking of each ligand, the original Auto-\nDock program reads the associated energy grids into the\ncorresponding CPU. For large-scale screening jobs, this\nscheme generates large amounts of input/output (I/O) file\noperations, which slows down the entire cluster system. It\nwould be ideal to load all energy grids only once to dock\nan entire block of ligands instead of repeating the I/O file\noperation for each ligand. Third, we find that directly\ninterfacing docking results with other programs using the\nnative AutoDock pdbq-format is potentially problematic.\nAlthough it is possible to convert a pdbq-formatted file\ninto other file formats by OpenBabel [5] or other pro-\ngrams, the converted structures are not guaranteed to pre-\nserve bond order, as this information is not recorded in\npdbq files. Preservation of bond order and atom sequence\namong input and output files would not only keep the\nintegrity of a molecule but also make it easier for users to\ncompare docked structures with results from other mode-\nling programs. Last, we note that enrichment of known\nligands from virtual screening can be improved by rescor-\ning the docked ligands with additional scoring functions.\nHence, it would be beneficial to have an automated pro-\ntocol in the DOVIS software that is capable of rescoring\ndocked ligands and selecting top-ranking ligands based\non these new scores.\nAccordingly, we enhanced the DOVIS software along the\nfour directions discussed above by: 1) developing a new\nparallelization scheme that automatically balances the\ncomputational load during runtime; 2) modifying the lat-\nest AutoDock source code to reduce I/O file operations; 3)\ncoding algorithms to output docked ligands and bond\ninformation in sd-file format; and 4) providing a wrapper\nscript interface to rescore docked ligands with third-party\nscoring functions. This last functionality also includes a\nhierarchical clustering method [6] to cluster and save\ndocked ligands based on user-selected scores.\nIn addition, we upgraded the DOVIS software to use Auto-\nDock 4.0 [7] as the docking engine. Compared to Auto-\nDock 3.05, AutoDock 4.0 has a wider range of force-field\natom types, including different atom types for both polar\nand non-polar hydrogens. This allows a user to better\nselect the appropriate atomic resolution when studying\nreceptor-ligand interactions or performing large-scale\ndocking campaigns. Therefore, we provide three choices\nfor AutoDock hydrogen models in DOVIS: one all-atom\nmodel and two polar-hydrogen models.\nThe significance of the new DOVIS 2.0 software imple-\nmentation compared with the previous version lies in its\nimproved performance and usability. The previous ver-\nsion of DOVIS made it possible to run large-scale virtual\nscreening in parallel on Linux clusters. The new version\nmakes the computation highly efficient by automating\nload balancing, significantly reducing the file I/O opera-\ntions, providing outputs that conform to industry stand-\nard sd-file format, and providing a general wrapper-script\ninterface for rescoring of docked ligands. Finally, the\nDOVIS 2.0 software, including AutoDock 4.0, is freely\navailable to the public under the GNU general public\nlicense (GPL).\nImplementation\nTo manage chemical information in DOVIS 2.0, we\napplied the C++ libraries from OpenBabel and setup a\nmolecular data structure as a C++ object in our program.\nThis makes handling of molecular structures (e.g., atoms\nand bonds) transparent between applications and outputs\nconsistent chemical information. We coded the new par-\nallelization scheme, the functions to manage AutoDock\nruns, and the algorithm to process docking results in C++.\nWe used Perl scripts to control the work flow, compute\nenergy grids, and link third-party scoring programs to\nDOVIS. Besides AutoDock and OpenBabel, Python scripts\nin AutoDock Tools [8] are also used by DOVIS to prepare\nChemistry Central Journal 2008, 2:18 http://journal.chemistryc entral.com/content/2/1/18\nPage 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nreceptor and ligand parameter files. Figure 1 summarizes\nthe work flow of DOVIS 2.0.\nThe DOVIS input file formats for receptors/proteins are\neither in pdb- or mol2-file format, whereas ligands/small\nmolecules are specified using the sd-file format. The out-\nput files contain the docked ligand structure and any aux-\niliary information in the sd-file format. As shown in\nFigure 1, a DOVIS run involves a sequential two-step proc-\ness. Initially, a DOVIS project directory is created that con-\ntains subdirectories and appropriate parameter files,\neither generated with default parameters or cloned from\nan existing project. Then, the energy grid calculations and\nthe parallel docking processes are launched; the docked\nligand-receptor complexes are generated and scored; and\nlastly, the top-ranking results are saved in the final output.\nDetailed usage of DOVIS is documented in the user's\nmanual distributed with the software. Below, we only dis-\ncuss the new features implemented in DOVIS 2.0.\nNew parallelization scheme\nThe components in the shaded area in Figure 1 are run in\nparallel on the assigned CPUs. We have developed a new\nparallelization scheme for these components to remove\ncomputational bottlenecks identified in the previous ver-\nsion of DOVIS. This scheme implements dynamic job\ncontrol capabilities and achieves dynamic load balancing\nwithout a dedicated master CPU. Thus, before the parallel\ndocking step, input ligands in sd-file format are parti-\ntioned into blocks of N ligands, where N is specified by\nthe user. During parallel docking, each CPU copies the\nenergy grids and other required files to its own temporary\ndirectory and requests a block of ligands through a file-\nlock mechanism. This ensures that each CPU gets one\nunique set of ligands to work with at a time. After com-\npleting a block of ligands, each CPU registers the finished\njob and updates the top-ranking ligands to the project\ndirectory. The CPU then requests another assignment.\nThis process is iterated until all ligand blocks are proc-\nessed. Finally, an assessment script verifies whether all\nassignments were successfully completed. Any requested\nbut unfinished ligand block is added back to the original\nlist of blocks to be reprocessed. Users are notified whether\nall original jobs were successfully completed or a restart is\nrequired to complete the docking project.\nSince each CPU works on one ligand block at a time and\nthese blocks are continuously requested by the available\nCPUs during a DOVIS run, by using small block sizes ( N\n<< total number of ligands) this scheme can provide an\neffective mechanism for automated, dynamic load balanc-\ning. In addition, we provide a mechanism to halt one or\nmore CPUs after their current ligand block is completed.\nThe number of CPUs needed for a restart run can also be\nchanged from run to run.\nThe current release package provides three approaches to\nstart parallel docking calculations: multithreading, secure\nshell (SSH), and queuing system. Multithreading and SSH\nare usually used on small Linux clusters without a queuing\nsystem. Multithreading is suited for shared-memory Linux\nclusters whereas SSH is suited for distributed-memory\nLinux clusters. For the queuing system approach, by\ndesign, DOVIS is capable of running under any queuing\nsystem. In this release, we provide an integration with the\nLoad Sharing Facilities (LSF), Platform Computing Inc.\n(Ontario, Canada), queuing system. However, users may\nuse our integration with LSF as an example to code equiv-\nalent CPU management functionalities based on other\nqueuing systems. Because queuing systems may impose\nruntime limits on jobs, we implemented a mechanism to\nWorkflow of DOVIS 2.0Figure 1\nWorkflow of DOVIS 2.0.

An assessment script monitors the overall\nprogress of the docking jobs and, should runtime limits\nbe exceeded, it notifies the user that a restart is required.\nAutoDock multiple-ligand docking mode\nIn the AutoDock program, only one ligand is docked at a\ntime in a docking run, and at each time the associated\nenergy grid files corresponding to every atom type in the\nligand are loaded into the corresponding CPU. Depend-\ning on the size of the energy grid and the number of atom\ntypes, approximately 10 Mb of data are loaded at every\ndocking run for each ligand. Most of the energy grids,\nhowever, can be reused from ligand to ligand. Hence, to\nimprove runtime efficiency and reduce I/O file opera-\ntions, we modified the AutoDock 4.0 source code to load\nthe energy grid files only once, while docking multiple lig-\nands in a single run. In this mode, energy grids of all atom\ntypes are loaded and a block of N ligands are sequentially\ndocked to a receptor.\nLigand file format\nIn DOVIS 2.0, we use the sd-file format as the ligand I/O\nformat to represent ligand information and associated\ndata. This format increases the portability of the docking\nresults to other modeling software, as most modeling pro-\ngrams are adopting the sd-file format. Using the sd-file\nformat, we can embed the estimated AutoDock binding\nfree energy and our converted AutoDock 4.0 score (the\ncorresponding pK\ni value at 298 K) with each docked lig-\nand. The reason we use the molecular data structure, a\nC++ object, from OpenBabel's C++ library is to be able to\nmanage chemical information and keep the consistency\nbetween input and output chemical structures. In con-\ntrast, if we were to use the OpenBabel file-conversion pro-\ngram to convert pdb-files into sd-files, the bonds and\nbond orders would not be guaranteed to be correct in the\nconverted files. This is because bond information typically\ndoes not exist in a pdb-file, and because an agreed-upon,\nreliable method to consistently predict a bond based\npurely on inter-atomic distance is not available. Instead,\nwe implemented an algorithm that traces input ligand\ninformation, processes AutoDock results, and maps\ndocked ligand atoms back to the input ligand structure.\nBecause an output ligand sd-file is based on the informa-\ntion from a corresponding input ligand sd-file, all atomic\ninformation, including bond connectivity, is preserved. If\nan all-atom model is used (see below, Hydrogen\nOptions), the atoms in the input and the output ligand sd-\nfiles have identical sequences.\nHydrogen options\nIn AutoDock 4.0, both polar and non-polar hydrogens are\nparameterized. Thus, all atoms including non-polar\nhydrogens can be explicitly modeled during docking.\nHowever, the scoring function in AutoDock 4.0 was devel-\noped based on receptor-ligand complexes with only polar\nhydrogens. In principle, it is necessary to reparameterize\nthe scoring function for the all-hydrogen model. To test\nthe tolerance of the provided default parameters, we\ndocked a set of receptor-ligand complexes using all-atom\nand polar-hydrogen models. The results are similar (see\nResults and Discussion) for both models. Therefore, we\nprovide both models as options in DOVIS 2.0. In addi-\ntion, we coded another option that uses the polar-hydro-\ngen model for docking and then adds non-polar\nhydrogens to docked ligands for rescoring. This option\ncombines the best of using the original AutoDock scoring\nfunction and the high resolution of all-atom modeling.\nThis also makes it convenient to compute pairwise root\nmean square deviation (RMSD) values between docked\nand reference ligand structures. It is still recommended\nthat users provide ligands with all hydrogens as inputs\neven when the polar-hydrogen model is used for docking,\nas the protonation state of a ligand is clearly represented\nonly when each hydrogen atom is specified. When the\nAutoDock parameter file is prepared for a ligand, non-\npolar hydrogens are removed, and their partial charges are\ncombined with the charge of the attached heavy atom.\nSimilarly, receptor energy grids are computed based on\neither the all-atom or the polar-hydrogen model.\nWrapper interface for scoring program and clustering\nIt is common practice to apply additional scoring func-\ntions to docked ligands after an initial docking run. To\nfacilitate this capability, we provide a wrapper script inter-\nface that enables the rescoring of docked ligands with\nthird-party scoring programs. The interface passes a set of\npredefined parameters, including the working directory,\nthe receptor pdb-file, the docked ligand sd-file, and the\nname of the scored ligand sd-file to a wrapper script. It\nalso passes customized parameters directly from the\nDOVIS input file to a wrapper script. This allows users to\nprepare a wrapper script to drive a scoring program of\nchoice that is linked to DOVIS through the DOVIS input\nfile, where the wrapper script commands are specified.\nAfter rescoring, a separate hierarchical clustering algo-\nrithm is available to cluster docked ligand poses based on\nscores from third-party scoring programs. The clustering\nalgorithm groups docked ligands based on their RMSD\nvalues. User-selected scores are employed to determine\nthe cluster centers and to save top-ranking ligands.\nResults and discussion\nWe used eight receptor-ligand complexes from the Protein\nData Bank (PDB) [9] to evaluate docking results using\nboth all-atom and polar-hydrogen models with the\ndefault AutoDock 4.0 scoring function. Hydrogen atoms\nChemistry Central Journal 2008, 2:18 http://journal.chemistryc entral.com/content/2/1/18\nPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwere added to all receptor and ligand input structures. The\nenergy grid center was defined as the geometrical center of\nthe bound ligand in the X-ray receptor-ligand complex.\nThe volume of the energy grid was defined as the volume\nof the bound ligand in the X-ray complex plus the addi-\ntional volume mapped out by extending the molecular\nsurface by 4.0 Å in each direction. Other AutoDock\nparameters were set as follows: five genetic algorithm (ga)\nruns, each with population size of 150, one million\nenergy evaluations, and a maximum of 27,000 genera-\ntions per ga run. Pairwise RMSD values were calculated\nbetween docked ligand poses and the corresponding X-ray\nligand.\nTable 1 lists the RMSD values and associated AutoDock\n4.0 scores of the docked ligand poses with the lowest\nRMSD for each of the eight complexes. The RMSD values\nof the all-atom model and of the polar-hydrogen model\nare similar for all eight complexes. For all complexes,\nexcept 4DFR\n (RMSD > 5.00 Å), the program found ligand\nposes close to the experimentally determined ligand pose.\nTable 1 also indicates that, except for 1RBP , where the\nscore of the all-atom model is much lower (predicting less\nbinding affinity) than the score of the polar-hydrogen\nmodel, both models produce similar scores. Figure 2\nshows the X-ray ligand and the docked ligand poses from\nthe complexes of 1STP\n and 1RBP. In the case of 1RBP, we\nbelieve that van der Waals (vdW) clashes between the\nreceptor and ligand atoms in the all-atom model caused\nthe difference between the two scores, because, as shown\nin Figure 2, the binding site of 1RBP\n is very cramped. In\nfact, the vdW radii in AutoDock 4.0 were enlarged to com-\npensate for missing non-polar hydrogens. Although our\ntests suggest that the docking results of both models are\ngenerally similar, even when the provided default param-\neters are used, users should be cautious about using the\nall-atom model with the default parameters. For a more\naccurate representation, users should scale down the vdW\nradii and re-parameterize the AutoDock 4.0 scoring func-\ntion when applying the all-atom model.\nAs discussed above, we modified the AutoDock 4.0 source\ncode to implement a strategy where multiple ligands are\ndocked by loading the energy grids only once. The effect\non the performance of the file system resulting from this\nenhancement is dramatic. For a block of 100 ligands, this\nstrategy results in a reduction of more than 95% in data\ntraffic, which is equivalent to a reduction of one Gigabyte\nof I/O data. This reduction takes place at every CPU. Thus,\nwhen hundreds of CPUs are engaged in a virtual screening\ncalculation, the overall impact on transfer rates in the file\nsystem is significant. For example, previously on our\nLinux cluster, we had to use the local disk drive at each\ncomputing node to minimize excessive I/O operations.\nUsing the proposed strategy, we may now use more than\n256 CPUs of a large cluster to run DOVIS and access data\non the cluster's central disk drive without degrading the\nperformance of the file system for other applications. In\naddition, we tested the time needed for DOVIS to dock a\nset of 10,000 ligands with varying numbers of CPUs. We\nperformed tests with up to 256 CPUs on a Linux cluster.\nWith the enhancements in the current version of DOVIS,\nwe observed a near-linear speedup up to the 256 CPUs\ntested using the cluster's central disk drive. This is in con-\ntrast with the previous version of DOVIS, which was capa-\nble of near-linear speedup to no more than 128 CPUs\nusing the local disk drive.\nAs an illustration of the technical performance of DOVIS\n2.0, using a total of 256 CPUs, we achieved an average\nthroughput of about 670 ligands/CPU/day. This estimate\nwas derived from a virtual screening calculation of 2.3\nmillion ligands from the ZINC database [10] (version 6)\nagainst a 259-amino acid protein target.

The \nentries in the table show the lowest RMSD values and associated AutoDock 4.0 scores for docked ligand poses of eight PDB complexes. Typically, \nthe difference in RMSD between the all-atom and the polar-hydrogen model is very small; the average absolute difference is 0.20 Å. a AutoDock 4.0 \nScore\nChemistry Central Journal 2008, 2:18 http://journal.chemistryc entral.com/content/2/1/18\nPage 6 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nbinding site was 28 × 40 × 24 Å. The related AutoDock\nparameters were set as follows: 10 ga runs, each with pop-\nulation size of 150, 250,000 energy evaluations, and a\nmaximum of 27,000 generations per ga run.\nCurrently, we are developing automated protocols to per-\nform ensemble docking [11] with DOVIS. The enhanced\nDOVIS software will take multiple conformations of a\nreceptor, automatically set up multiple sets of energy\ngrids, dock ligands into each receptor conformation, and\nprocess the results.\nConclusion\nWe have enhanced the DOVIS software by improving its\nperformance, screening capability, and usability. DOVIS\n2.0 incorporates the most-recent release of AutoDock,\nAutoDock 4.0, implements a more efficient paralleliza-\ntion scheme, allows for rescoring with user-provided scor-\ning programs, and outputs results in the sd-file format.\nFurthermore, the software comes with an automatic\ninstaller and is available to the public under the GNU\nGPL.\nAvailability and requirements\nProject name: DOVIS\nOperating system: Linux\nProgramming language: C++, Perl, and Python\nLicense: GNU GPL\nProject download: http://www.bioanalysis.org/down\nloads/DOVIS-2.0.1-installer.tar.gz\nAuthors' contributions\nXJ designed, implemented, and tested the software and\ndrafted the original manuscript.
