  "abstract": "Abstract Objective Large-language models (LLMs) in healthcare have the potential to propagate existing biases or introduce new ones. For people with epilepsy, social determinants of health are associated with disparities in access to care, but their impact on seizure outcomes among those with access to specialty care remains unclear. Here we (1) evaluated our validated, epilepsy-specific LLM for intrinsic bias, and (2) used LLM-extracted seizure outcomes to test the hypothesis that different demographic groups have different seizure outcomes. Methods First, we tested our LLM for intrinsic bias in the form of differential performance in demographic groups by race, ethnicity, sex, income, and health insurance in manually annotated notes. Next, we used LLM-classified seizure freedom at each office visit to test for outcome disparities in the same demographic groups, using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results We analyzed 84,675 clinic visits from 25,612 patients seen at our epilepsy center 2005-2022. We found no differences in the accuracy, or positive or negative class balance of outcome classifications across demographic groups. Multivariable analysis indicated worse seizure outcomes for female patients (OR 1.33, p = 3x10 -8 ), those with public insurance (OR 1.53, p = 2x10 -13 ), and those from lower-income zip codes (OR ≥ 1.22, p ≤ 6.6x10 -3 ). Black patients had worse outcomes than White patients in univariable but not multivariable analysis (OR 1.03, p = 0.66). Significance We found no evidence that our LLM was intrinsically biased against any demographic group. Seizure freedom extracted by LLM revealed disparities in seizure outcomes across several demographic groups. These findings highlight the critical need to reduce disparities in the care of people with epilepsy. Key Points We used large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing to extract seizure outcomes from clinical note text. We found no evidence of intrinsic bias in the LLM algorithm, in that it performed similarly across all demographic groups. Using LLM-extracted seizure outcomes, female sex, public insurance, and lower income zip- codes were associated with higher likelihood of seizures at each visit. Black race was associated with higher likelihood of seizures in univariable but not multivariable analysis. These findings highlight the critical need to reduce disparities in the care of people with epilepsy.",

NLP is vulnerable to perpetuated bias because \nbiases present in unstructured note text and in healthcare delivery more broadly will be incorporated into \nthe NLP algorithm. For example, a recent algorithm for identifying opioid misuse using clinical notes was \nfound to have bias in Black compared to White individuals.\n12,13 Recent developments in ethical AI have \nemphasized the importance of ensuring equality in model performance between protected groups.8,10,11,14,15  \n \nWe have recently developed and validated an NLP algorithm to extract epilepsy outcome measures from \nthe unstructured text of clinical notes with accuracy similar to human readers.\n16–18 In this study, we first \ntested our algorithm for bias, in the form of differential performance in different demographic groups. An \nunbiased NLP algorithm was a prerequisite to our second objective, which was to use the algorithm to test \nthe hypothesis that different demographic groups have different likelihoods of seizure freedom at our \nacademic US healthcare center. \n \n  \n .

From these records, \nwe obtained clinical notes written by their epileptologist(s) with full text and date; medication \nprescriptions; and demographic information including race, sex, zip code, age, and insurance provider at \neach visit. We excluded patients with missing demographic data. \n \nOutcomes: seizure classification by NLP\n \nWe recently developed and validated an NLP algorithm that classifies clinic notes as seizure-free or \nhaving recent seizures.16,17 Briefly, we used Clinical_BERT,19 a publicly-available transformer language \nmodel from Google AI, on 700 manually annotated epileptologist notes. We defined a “seizure free” visit \nas one where the patient did not have seizures since their last visit, or within the past year, whichever was \nmore recent. Model predictions were repeated five times using different seeds, and final classification of \neach note was determined by plurality voting of the five outputs.  \n \nExposures: Demographic Variables\n \nRace, ethnicity, and sex were self-reported by patients at the time of initial registration with our health \nsystem, while zip code and insurance were entered and verified by clinic registration staff. Category \noptions were determined by the Epic electronic health record software (Epic, Madison WI). Race category \noptions were as follows, listed alphabetically: American Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian; Black or \nAfrican American; East Indian; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Some Other Race; White. \nOnly Asian, Black, and White had sufficient samples for analysis, and the other categories were combined \ninto a category of “Other Races.” Ethnicity categories were Hispanic Latino or Not Hispanic Latino. Sex \ncategories were female or male. Gender identities, including trans and non-binary genders, were not \nrecorded. \n \nZip codes were linked to median household income, in inflation-adjusted 2020 dollars, using publicly \navailable data from the US Census (data.census.gov). We grouped zip codes into four categories \naccording to median household income: (1) less than $50,000; (2) $50,000 to less than $75,000; (3) \n$75,000 to less than $100,000; (4) $100,000 or more. Insurance type was classified as private insurance, \nMedicare, or Medicaid. For purposes of analysis we combined Medicare and Medicaid into a single \ncategory of public insurance. Age was grouped into the following categories: 18-39, 40-64, and 65 or \nolder. \n \nAssessing Model Bias\n \nThese analyses used 192 manually-annotated notes from the validation dataset from our previous study.16 \nHuman annotations were performed in triplicate by independent readers who were unaware of the \nidentities or demographics of the patients. Here we sought to determine whether our NLP models \nperformed differently in different demographic groups using several measures. First, we calculated the \n . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a \n is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)preprint \nThe copyright holder for thisthis version posted September 22, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.20.23295842doi: medRxiv preprint \n \n \naccuracy of the model classifications (seizure free vs. recent seizure), where accuracy was the number of \ncorrect classifications divided by all classifications (Supplemental Methods). Second, we calculated the \npositive class balance (PCB) and negative class balance (NCB) of each demographic group.15,20 These \nmethods use the probability values that accompany each model prediction (for example, the model may \npredict that a note describes recent seizures with probability of 0.92). PCB is the average predicted \nprobability of recent seizures in patients who did have recent seizures, with an expected value near 1. \nNCB is the average predicted probability of recent seizures in patients who did not have recent seizures, \nwith an expected value near 0. If the NLP model made predictions with perfect confidence, the PCB \nwould be the complement of the false negative rate (FNR = 1 - PCB) and the NCB would be the \nequivalent of the false positive rate (FPR = NCB). \n \nStatistical Analysis\n \nFor the analysis of model bias, we tested for differences in accuracy, PCB, and NCB between \ndemographic groups using Fisher's exact tests (accuracy) or two-tailed permutation tests with 10,000 \niterations (class balances) for the binary demographic variables (sex, ethnicity, and insurance), and using \ntwo-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests against the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution for other \ncategorical variables (race, income, and age). \n \nFor testing associations between demographics and seizure freedom classification, we performed a series \nof logistic mixed effects regression models. In each model the outcome was the seizure freedom \nclassification of each visit; exposure was the demographic variable; and patient was the clustering \nvariable (random effect) to account for intra-individual correlation across repeated measures. We included \nthe time (in months) since last visit as a covariate in each model, to account for the fact that patients with \nfrequent seizures are likely to be seen more often than seizure-free patients.\n18 Additionally, we included \nthe number of ASMs a patient was prescribed at the time of a visit as a variable of interest to act as a \npositive control, as we expected to find an association between seizure freedom likelihood and number of \nASMs. \n \nFirst we tested each demographic variable in a separate mixed effects model, representing “univariable” \nanalyses, adjusting only for time since last visit, and patient-specific random effect. Second, we combined \nall demographic variables in a single mixed-effects model, representing a multivariable analysis to assess \nthe competing effects of demographic variables.  \n \nWe adjusted p-values for multiple comparisons in both the regression and bias univariable analyses using \nthe Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method with an \n/i3  of 0.05.21 \n \nWe included additional methodological details within our supplement. All analyses were performed with \nPython and used the following packages: transformers, statsmodels, numpy, pandas, scipy, forestplot, and \npymer4.

Specially, female patients (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.21-1.50, adj. p = 7.9x10-8), Black patients (OR \n1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.58, adj. p = 1.4x10-7), patients with public insurance (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.33-1.64, \nadj. p = 4.6x10-12), and patients living in zip codes with less than $100,000 median income (OR ≥  1.17, \nadj. p ≤  0.037), were more likely to have recent seizures than patients from privileged groups. Older \npatients were more likely to be seizure free than younger patients. Greater numbers of prescribed ASMs \nwere associated with lower likelihood of seizure freedom, as expected.  \n \nSome but not all of these disparities persisted in the multivariable regression analysis (Table 2). Black \npatients no longer had significantly higher odds of seizures, and patients of Other Races had significantly \nlower odds of seizures than White patients, indicating some overlap between the effects of race and other \ndemographic variables. \n \nFigure 2: Disparities in seizure freedom likelihood.  \nForest plot with univariable estimates of odds ratios (OR) of recent seizures at each office visit. ORs were \nestimated from logistic mixed model regression at the visit level, grouping visits by patients, and \ncontrolling for time since last visit. “Other Races” included “American Indian or Alaskan Native”, “East \nIndian”, “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander”, and “Some Other Race.” Adjusted p-values were \ncalculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction with an \n/i3  0.05. \n \n \n \n .

Female sex, Black race, public insurance, and lower income zip-codes were all \nassociated with higher likelihood of seizures at each clinic visit, controlling for the time between visits. \nThe disparities by sex, insurance, and income persisted after controlling for other demographic factors.  \n \nWe did not find evidence of bias in our algorithm, in that the models performed similarly across all \ndemographic groups. This work aligns with the American Medical Association’s policy recommendations \nthat emphasized the development of health care AI with a mind to identify biases and prevent \nexacerbation of health disparities.\n9,22 Our finding is particularly important because other pretrained \ntransformer models have exhibited bias in several contexts.23,24 The observation that our model was \nunbiased suggests that disparities in seizure freedom likelihood were not influenced by model failures. \n  \nOur findings indicate that seizure freedom likelihood is influenced by demographic factors. Prior studies \nof disparities in the care of patients with epilepsy have focused mainly on access to specialty care,4,6,7,25 \nwith fewer studies examining disparities in epilepsy outcomes. Black patients are less likely to undergo \nepilepsy surgery than White or Hispanic patients,26 but one study of outcomes after temporal lobe \nepilepsy surgery in 252 patients found no differences according to race or socioeconomic status.27 \nAlthough socioeconomic factors are associated with differences in ASM adherence,28–32 the downstream \nimpact on epilepsy outcomes have not been reported. A study of adults with epilepsy in the Swedish \npopulation registry found that lower income and education were associated with more hospitalizations \nand less access to neurologists.\n33 A study of 1,038 pediatric patients found that Hispanic/Latino ethnicity \nand lower income zip codes were associated with seizures that worsened over time.34 Our findings add to \nthe growing awareness that health outcomes of people with epilepsy vary with demographic factors, and \nthe critical need to understand and remedy these disparities. Our patients were all receiving care at a \nspecialized academic epilepsy center, so the outcome disparities we observed were not due to unequal \naccess to neurologic care per se. This suggests that structural barriers and disparities in access to \nhealthcare resources or care delivery persist, and impact health outcomes, even in patients with \nsubspecialist access. \n  \nIn our multivariable analysis, disparities according to sex, insurance, and income persisted after \ncontrolling for other demographic factors, while race was no longer significantly associated with the \nlikelihood of seizure freedom. Race and socioeconomic status are strongly correlated in US society due to \npast and present structural racism, and this correlation means they may not be independent predictors of \nhealth outcomes. In our study, socioeconomic factors (income and insurance) were the stronger predictors \nof seizure freedom. Notably, the multivariable model also accounted for the number of prescribed \nmedications and the time between clinic visits, meaning that two patients seen at similar intervals, \nprescribed the same number of antiseizure medications, have different seizure freedom likelihoods based \nin part on socioeconomic factors. \n \nOur study had several limitations. Our data do not reveal the cause of the disparities we observed. Future \nstudies must seek to understand the causes and, more importantly, attempt interventions to reduce the \ndisparities that are now widely recognized throughout healthcare.

Our study was performed at a US \nacademic medical center with a presumed bias towards more difficult and complex epilepsies. A possible \nlimitation of our analysis of NLP model bias is that, if biases were present in the human annotations used \nfor both training and testing our NLP model, this could be internalized by the model and not detected in \nits performance on the testing set. However, our human annotations were performed in triplicate by \nindependent readers who were unaware of the identities or demographics of the patients, so bias at that \nstep is unlikely. \n \n  \n .
