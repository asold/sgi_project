Introduction \nModern machine-building industry set to machine-tool building a task to increase the accuracy \nand efficiency of metal-cutting machine tools, as well as requirements for minimizing their cost. This \nleads to the need to search for new and improving existing machine tools designs, to the need to use \nscientifically based design method based on mathematical modelling of various processes occurring \nin the machine, which provide an opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of the machine and the \nimpact on it of individ ual assembly already at the initial stages of design. Application of such \nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 38 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nmethods accelerates the process of project development, provides the possibility of optimizing the \ndesign and leads to a significant reduction in the cost of creating and refining pr ototypes. \nOne of the perspective directions for the implementation of scientifically grounded design \nmethod is the design of body parts of metal -cutting machine tools. Nowadays, during designing of \nbody parts of metal -cutting machine tools mainly used calc ulation s chemes [1] in which the real \ndesigns of metal-cutting machine tools are presented in the form of simple beam and plate models, \nas well as general empirical recommendations obtained on the basis of experimental studies of \nexisting body parts. Such kind of approach does not allow to sufficiently substantiate the feasibility \nof the application of a particular body component design and significantly complicates the \nassessment of new structures of body parts, in which there is no experimental data. At t he same \ntime, recently the considerable development of methods of calculating the accuracy of machines, as \nwell as mathematical modelling of stressed-deformed state, modelling the flow of fluid in different \nassemblies of the metal -cutting machine [2], espe cially the finite element method, makes it possible \nto develop and introduce new, more precise and efficient methods of calculation and optimization of \nmachine tools’ body parts. \nThus, researches aimed at developing scientifically based methods for calcula ting and \ndesigning the metal-cutting machine tools’ body parts is an urgent scientific task. \n2. Literature Review \nThe supporting system of the metal -cutting machi ne tool must provide precise re ciprocal \nmovement of the tool and workpiece. The quality of supporting system is characterized by relative \ndisplacements of its elements, brought to the cutting zone, which arise under the influence of \nperturbations of various situations on the machine. Body parts are part of the machine's supporting \nsystem. They provide a given location relative to each other individual assembly of the machine [3].  \nThe main methods of calculating the body parts currently used in the design of metal -cutting \nmachine tools are given in works [4, 5, 6]. The main task of calculating the  body parts of \nmetal-cutting machine tools is to evaluate the impact on the accuracy of the processing of their \ndisplacements that arise under the influence of disturbing loads of different nature. This effect is \nnumerically characterized by relative displ acements of the tool and the workpiece along the normal \nline to the surface caused by deformations of body parts. \nNowadays, analytical methods and the method of finite elements are used to calculate \ndeformations of metal-cutting machine tools’ body parts. \nWhen using analytical methods [7, 8] the design that is calculated is presented as a set of beams \nor plates. By implementing certain assumptions, for each of these elements you can obtain a solution \nby analytical methods. In order to clarify the analytical solution coefficients obtained empirically are \nimplemented into the calculation scheme. These coefficients are used, for example, to determine the \nvalues of bending, displacement and twisting stiffness of the beams included in the calculation \nscheme. \nThe advantage of analytical methods is their relative simplicity, and the fact that the used \nanalytical formulas clearly show the effect of a particular design parameter calculated on its \ndisplacement, the ability to quick comparison of different design versio ns. \nAt the same time, analytical methods have significant drawbacks . When using them , we can’t \ntake into account the real geometric shape of the body parts, local deformations of the individual \nstructural elements. Analytic solutions for complex form parts  have a significant error and require \ncorrection using empirical coefficients . They, in turn , can be applied only to a limited set of \nconstructs similar to those for which experimental data are available.  \nThese disadvantages significantly limit the possibi lity of using analytical methods and lead to \nthe need to use the finite element method. This method is described in [9].  \nWhen using the finite element method, the design that is calculated is represented as a set of \nsimple geometric objects - finite elements. For each of them the type of the functional dependence of \nthe distribution of displacements in this element is determined from displacements in its nodes. \nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 39 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nNodes provide the connection between elements, and their movement determines the \nstress-deformed state of the design. \nThe disadvantage of this approach is that the classical calculation scheme [9] does not take into \naccount the mutual deformations of joints and connecting parts. This reduces the accuracy of the \ncalculation and makes it impossible to use this calculation scheme to assess the impact of the form of \nstructural elements. \nAll of the foregoing limits the application of the two above -mentioned approaches to the \ncalculation of contact displacements . This leadsto the necessity to construct an ap proach in which \ntheir own deformations of body parts and contact deformations in joints are considered together \nwith the actual dependence between displacements and pressures at each junction point.  \nThe mentioned drawbacks of the used methods of calculatio n lead to the need to clarify the \nfinite-elements calculations of metal -cutting machine tools’ body parts in order to more attentively \ntaking into account the deformations of the individual structural elements of the body parts. In this \ncase, conditions of  their fixing and loading (including taking into account their own displacements \nof parts and contact displacements in joints) should be taken into acc ount, as well as the impact of \ndeformations of body parts on the accuracy of the machine. \nAs shown above,  existing methods of calculating metal -cutting machine tools’ body parts do \nnot fully ensure the consideration of their individual design features . These individual features  do \nnot allow on the stage of design sufficient accuracy an estimation of the impac t of force \ndisplacements on the accuracy of the machine tool. Due to this, there is a need to develop a \ncalculation methodology that would be deprived of these drawbaсs. \n3. Researches Methodology \n3.1. Requirements to the method of calculating force displacements \nBased on the analysis of existing methods for calculating of metal -cutting machine tools’ body \nparts and the requirements for their design, presented above, we can formulate following \nrequirements to the methodology for calculating force displacements: \n1. Ensure the consideration of local deformations of all structural elements that have a \nsignificant effect on the displacement of the base surfaces (the boundaries of guides, the surface \nof the spindle towers). \n2. Provide close to the actual design fastening and loading schemes. \n3. During calculating a design, consisting of several parts, take into account the actual \nconditions of contact between them. \n4. Perform calculation for any possible variant of moving assemblies location and cutting \nareas, as well as automatically execute a series of calculations for a given set of such variants.  \n5. Use a geometric design model that is calculated in an existing automated design system.  \n6. Calculate the stress -deformed state with the help of existing pro grams of finite-element \nanalysis. \nThe general scheme of the proposed calculation method is presented in Figure 1.  \nThe input data for the calculation is the geometric form of the considered body parts, forces and \nconditions of fastening applied to them, as well as the location of the cutting area and moving \nassemblies of the machine tool. \nResults of the calculation are components of the processing errors caused by the deformations \nof considered body parts, or (in case where several variants of the location o f moving assemblies are \nconsidered) deviations of the shape of the workpiece due to the deformations of the considered body \nparts. \nDuring calculation, designing of the geometric and  finite-element of the construc tion is \nperformed, which is calculated, the application of conditions of fastening and forces, calculation of \nthe stress -deformed state, and then we determine the displacement of the base points (on the \nsurfaces of the body parts on which the moving knots are based), and then determine the spatial \nposition of the moving assemblies of the machine and calculate the displacement of the tool and the \nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 40 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nworkpiece, due to the cutting zone. Based on the above displacements, the components of the \ndimensional processing errors are calculated for a given location  of the moving assemblies and the \ncutting zone. \nDeviations of the shape of the processed workpiece are determined by calculating the \nprocessing components for different coordinates of the moving assemblies and their reduction to the \ncoordinate system associated with the workpiece. \n \nFigure 1. Block-scheme of the methodology for calculating the components of the processing errors \nand deviations of the shape of the processed surfaces caused by deformations of metal-cutting \nmachine tools’ body parts; * – operations that are implemented using macros \nThe calculation method is implemented using ANSYS finite -element analysis software [10]. For \nthe performance of operations not specific to the metal-cutting tools’ body parts, the built-in ANSYS \ntools are used. \nOperations that are common only for the calculations of metal -cutting tools (defining forces for \ndifferent positions of moving assemblies, determining the displacements of base points, the spatial \nposition of moving assemblies, calculating the components o f processing errors and deviations of \nthe shape of the workpieces) are absent in common systems of finite -element analysis (including \nANSYS). These operations were implemented using developed by user programs (macroses) written \nwith the help of language APDL - embedded programming language in ANSYS. \n3.2. Features of geometric and finite-element models used in the calculation scheme \nThe initial stage in the finite -element calculation of metal -cutting machine tools’ body parts is \nthe construction of a geometric and finite-element model design, which is calculated. The geometric \nmodel is needed to determine the geometric shape of the calculated structure, and the finite-element \n- contains complete information about the location of assemblies and finite elements , as well as the \nlinks between individual assemblies and elements. \nAlso, it is possible to carry out a finite-element calculation without using a geometric model, but \nin this case, when calculating, it is necessary to manually specify the coordinates of al l nodes and \nbuild finite elements and finite element model, which is practically impossible for the metal -cutting \nmachine tools’ body parts paying attention to the complexity of their geometric shapes [11]. \n\nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 41 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nWith the use of a geometric model, this drawback is absent because of the fact that in modern \nfinite-element analysis software it is possible to obtain the finite -element splitting of a component \nautomatically, which is calculated based on its geometric model. This allows us to recommend this \napproach for modelling metal-cutting machine tools’ body parts. \nDeformations of body parts can be modelled using the following types of finite element models: \n– from beam and rod elements; \n– from plate elements; \n– from volumetric elements. \nFor each of these variants, the type of geometric model must correspond to the type of model of \nfinite elements, that is, for a finite element model from beam or rod elements, the geometric model \nshould consist of lines, for plate elements - from surfaces, for volumetric elements - from volumetric \nbodies. \nIn this article, the finite element models from the beam and rod elements are not considered, \nsince they do not ensure the conformity of the geometric shape of the model and the real design. \nModels of plate elements are also not better due to their disadvantages, indicated in section 2. \nAnalysing above mentioned, for the calculation of metal -cutting machine tools’ body parts, \nfinite-element models of volumetric elements should be used. They have the following advantages \ncompared with models of plate elements: \n1. Provide more accurate impact of the geometry of the body part. It is possible to take into \naccount many elements of the design that are not available for plate models.  \n2. In modern CAD systems, volumetric geometry models are m ain means of de -scribing \nthe design of the parts being developed and used as a basis for creating of design \ndocumentation. In this situation, the surface model design, which is calculated, requires that it \nmust be rebuilt from scratch, and the volumetric c an be obtained by modifying the above \ndesign model, which provides significantly less time and reduces the probability of errors.  \n3. In surface models, it is necessary to set and contr ol parameters of the finite ele ments \n(thickness) for each surface. In volumetric models, there is no such kind of a need. \nThe main disadvantage of volumetric finite -element models is that they usually re -quire a \ngreater number of levels of freedom than surface one and, consequently, high costs of computing \nresources. However, with the d evelopment of computer technolo gy, this problem is becoming less \nsignificant. \n4. Results \nIn Figure 2 and Figure 3 examples of volumetric geometric and finite -element models used in \ncalculations of high-precision lathe machines are presented. \n \nFigure 2. Geometric models of supporting system and the body ofspindle assembly of lathe machine \nMK6510F4 \n\nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 42 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nOn the basis of calculations of metal -cutting machine tools’ body parts, the following \nrecommendations can be made in relation to their geometric and finite-element models: \n1. From the geometric model, all structural elements that have no significant effect on structural \ndeformation (small openings, depressions, etc.) should be excluded. This requirement is needed, \nbasically, to provide a more qualitative finite-element partition. \n2. Despite the presence in many CAE -systems of its own geometric pre-processors, geometric \nmodels should be built in CAD systems, and then exported to the CAE -system through translators. \nIt is desirable to build th em by simplifying already existing design models. This approach provides \nbetter quality and lesser time for the preparation of geometric models.  \n3. Areas of a geometric model, on which forces or conditions of fastening will be applied, \nshould be allocated on separate surfaces. \n4. For a finite-element model, a grid of tetrahedral elements of the second order (with additional \nnodes at the middle of the sides) should be used. The advantage of tetrahedral elements in front of \nelements with another topology lies in the fact  that their use ensures the possibility of automatically \nbreaking the geometric model into the finite elements. Currently existing algorithms for partitioning \non hexahedral elements do not provide the possibility of such a breakdown automation for volumes \nof complex shape. \n5. To estimate the calculation error associated with the size of the finite element, it is necessary \nto calculate several times for different variants of the finite elemental grids, which differ in size from \nthe finite elements. In this case, the size of the finite elements for different parts of the model should \nbe reduced proportionally to each other. \n \nFigure 3. Models of the finite-elements of the supporting system and the body ofspindle assembly of \nlathe machine MK6510F4 \nThe main task of calculating of metal -cutting machines body parts is to evaluate the effect of \ntheir deformations on the accuracy of the machine, which is characterized by relative displacements \nof the tool and the workpiece. In the case where the tool and the work piece are not included in the \ndesign, it is necessary to ensure that its force displacements are brought to these elements.  \nDuring designing of the calculation scheme as the basic design is used assembly unit, including \nsimplified models of the frame and a base of the metal-cutting ma-chine MK6510F4. Simplification of \nthe model was performed in order to reduce the dimension of the finite element model.  \nIn this work, first of all, we consider the features of force displacements, which are common to \nfinite element calculations and, in particular, we reviewed types of ma -chines (Figure 4). The lathes \nof this design have two supports - transverse and longitudinal. \nThe two main cases of displacements to the cutting zone, common to this type of machines, are \nconsidered: \n1. Adjustment of displacements of the body of the spindle headstock.  \n\nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 43 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \n2. Adjustment of guides displacements. \nWhen finding displacements of the spindle headstock, it is necessary, based on its \nstress-deforming state, to calculate the displacements to the cutting zone, as well as components of \nprocessing errors caused by deformations of the body of the spindle headstock. The sequence of \nactions during calculation of the components of the error of processing caused by deformations of \nthe body of the spindle head includes the following steps: \n1. Determination of displacements of base points; \n2. Calculation of displacements of spindle supports; \n3. Bringing to the cutting zone displacements of the spindle caused by deformations of the \nbody of the spindle headstock; \n4. Calculation of components of errors of treatment of diametrical and longitudinal \ndimensions caused by deformations of the body of the spindle headstock.  \n \nFigure 4. The location of the main components for this layout of the lathe with two supports \nThe base points for determining the displacement of the spindle support are a set of points \nevenly distributed over the surface under the spindle support (Figure 5). The displacement of each \nof the spindle supports is defined as the arithmetic mean of the reference points on the surface below \nthat support. The displacement of the base points can be obtained, in turn, from the stress -strain \nstate obtained in the finite element calculation. \nThe offset in the X, Y and Z coordinates of the front spindle support: \n∆𝑋А1 = ∆𝑋А1 + ∆𝑋А2 + ⋯ + ∆𝑋А𝑛\n𝑛  ; \n                        ∆𝑌А1 = ∆𝑌А1 + ∆𝑌А2 + ⋯ + ∆𝑌А𝑛\n𝑛  ;                    (1)  \n∆𝑍А1 = ∆𝑍А1 + ∆𝑍А2 + ⋯ + ∆𝑍А𝑛\n𝑛  . \n \nFigure 5. Points used as a base points to calculate displacements of spindle supports \n \n\nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 44 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nThe offset in the X, Y and Z coordinates of the rear spindle support: \n∆𝑋𝐵1 = ∆𝑋B1 + ∆𝑋B2 + ⋯ + ∆𝑋B𝑛\n𝑛  ; \n∆𝑌B1 = ∆𝑌B1 + ∆𝑌B2 + ⋯ + ∆𝑌B𝑛\n𝑛  ;                      (2) \n∆𝑍B1 = ∆𝑍B1 + ∆𝑍B2 + ⋯ + ∆𝑍B𝑛\n𝑛  . \nIn presented formulas XAi, YAi, ZAi, XBi, YBi, the offset by the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the \nreference points on the surfaces under the front support of the spindle (points Ai) and under the rear \nsupport of the spindle (points Bi); n – is the number of base points on the surface of the spindle \nsupport (for the scheme shown in Figure 4, n = 4). \nThe displacement along the Z -axis of the front support (DZB) and the corresponding \ndisplacements of the reference points on the surface under this resistance are not determined. This \nsupport is usually floating. \nBased on displacements of spindle supports, the displacements of the spindle head body to the \ncutting area, were determined (point D, Figure 6). The calculation was carried out for geometric \nreasons (Figure 6). As the deformation is determined not for the spindle, but for the ho using, the \nspindle axis is considered as a segment passing through the centers of the spindle supports, the \ndisplacements to the cutting zone are calculated on the basis of the rotations and displacements of \nthe given segment caused by the displacements of  the supports. Since the rear support is usually \nmade floating (no fixation in the axial direction), the displacement of the cutting zone in the axial \ndirection is determined based on the corresponding displacement of the front support.  \n \nFigure 6. Scheme of calculation of displacements of the body of the spindle headstock of the cutting \nzone \nBased on the geometric dependencies shown in Figure 6, the following formulas were obtained \nto determine the offsets by the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the cutting zo ne: \n∆𝑋𝐷 = ∆𝑋𝐷 + |(∆𝑋𝐴 − ∆𝑋𝐵) LAD\nLAB\n| ; \n                        ∆𝑌𝐷 = ∆𝑌𝐷 + |(∆𝑌𝐴 − ∆𝑌𝐵) LAD\nLAB\n| ;                       (3) \n∆𝑍D = ∆𝑍A. \nThe components of the machining errors due to the deformations of the structure that are \ncalculated under the action of the cutting forces are calculated based on the displacements of the \ncutting zone: \nDРК  = 2XD (for longitudinal processing);                 (4)  \nLРК = -ZD  (for transverse processing).                   (5)  \nThe following info describes the procedure for determining the spatial position of the \ntransverse support. The spatial position of the longitudinal support is defined similarly.  \n\nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 45 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nBased on the assumption that there is no influence of deformation of the structure, which is \ncalculated on the deformation of  other units of the machine. Also, the calculated components of the \nmachining errors are due only to deformations of the base surfaces of the guides and housings of the \nsupport screws, the support in the calculation of the components of the machining error s can be \nconsidered as a solid, the spatial position of which is determined by the displacements of the base \npoints on the surfaces of the guides and bodies of the support screws.  \nFirst of all, the spatial position of the housing of the screw of the suppor t is determined, which \nprovides axial fixation of the screw (Figure 7). The displacement of the center of the support surface \nof the housing of the support of the screw of the support (points AКОХВ) along the X axis is calculated \nas the arithmetic mean of the corresponding displacements of the base points A1, A2, A3, A4: \n             𝑈𝐴𝐾𝑂𝑋𝐵𝑋𝐷 = 𝑈𝐴1𝑋 + 𝑈𝐴2𝑋 + 𝑈𝐴3𝑋 + 𝑈𝐴4𝑋\n4 ;                           (6) \n \nFigure 7. Points used as bases in determining the spatial position of supports \nThe angle of  rotation of the housing of the screw around the Z axis is calculated as the \narithmetic mean of the angles of rotation of segments A1A2 and A3A4 around this axis:  \n        𝛼𝐾𝑂𝑋𝐵𝑍 = 𝛼𝐴1𝐴2𝑍 + 𝛼𝐴3𝐴4𝑍\n2 ;                                      (7) \nThe remaining spatial coordinates of the support screw housing (two displacements and two \nrotation angles) are not calculated, as they do not affect the axial displacement of the screw.  \nBased on the spatial position of the housing, the displacement of the supp ort screw in the axial \ndirection (along the X axis) is determined. Because in the machines of this design, each of the \nrunning screws has an axial fixation in only one support. The axial displacement of the screw -nut \ntransmission is assumed to be equal to the axial displacement of the support. \nThe axial displacements of the transmission of the screw-nut determine the dis-placement of the \nsupport along the X axis (along the guides), since the ability to move the support along the guides \ndoes not allow the influence of the displacements of the guides along the X axis on the displacement \nof the support. \nThe offset of the caliper at the point BСУП on the X-axis (UВСУПX) is determined based on the axial \ndisplacement of the screw-nut transmission and the angle of rotation of the support around the Z axis \n(αСУПZ). The calculation scheme does not con -sider the displacements due to the propulsive of the \n\nAETiC2019, Vol. 3, No. 4 46 \n www.aetic.theiaer.org \nscrew-nut transmission, the axial displacement of the transmission can be taken to be equal to the \noffset on the axis X of the housing support of the screw (UAKOHVX).  \nBased on the spatial position of the support and the location of the cutting zone, it is possible to \ncalculate the displacement of the support in the cutting zone. The offsets are reduced to the point on \nthe spindle axis. However, to provide greater versatility of the calculation method, it was necessary \nthat the radius of the workpiece was very small compared to other sizes of the calculated design.  \n5. Conclusions \nThe basic technical and technological requirements for geometrical and finite element models of \nbody parts of metal cutting machines used in the construction of the calculation scheme are \nformulated. The ways of taking into account in the calculation scheme of different conditions of \nfixing and loading, characteristic for the body parts of metal-cutting machines, are offered. \nMacros have been developed in the embedded ANSYS finite -element analysis programming \nlanguage. They provide the calculation of the force displacements reduced to the cutting z one based \non the displacements of the base points (obtained by calculating the stress -strain state in ANSYS). \nThe developed approach makes it possible to calculate for any possible variant of the location of \nthe moving units and the cutting zone, as well as to automatically perform a series of calculations for \na given set of such variants. \nThe proposed method of designing metal -cutting machines ensures the obtaining of the \ndimensions of the body parts and their individual structural elements by means of par ametric \noptimization. This makes it possible to reduce the effect of deformation of the body parts on the \naccuracy of the machine. The task of optimization is to find such thicknesses of the walls of the \nhousing at which it would have maximum rigidity while storing its original mass. \nIt should be noted that many aspects of the approach to finite element calculations of machine \nbody parts can also be used for machines of other types, as well as for dynamic and thermal \ncalculations, if techniques for calculating these processes are developed. \nThe implemented approach to design and calculation of power displacements of body parts of \nmetal-cutting machines with the help of CAD and CAE technologies provides much less expense of \ncomputing resources and time. \nReferences \n[1] Redko, R., Zabolotnyi, O., Redko, O., Savchuk, S., Kovalchuk, V.
