  "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), in health care holds potential for improved efficiency and decision support. However, ethical concerns must be addressed before widespread adoption. This article focuses on the ethical principles surrounding the use of Generative Pretrained Transformer-4 and its conversational model, ChatGPT, in healthcare settings. One concern is potential inaccuracies in generated content. LLMs can produce believable yet incorrect information, risking errors in medical records. Opacity of training data exacerbates this, hindering accuracy assessment. To mitigate, LLMs should train on precise, validated medical data sets. Model bias is another critical concern because LLMs may perpetuate biases from their training, leading to medically inaccurate and discriminatory responses. Sampling, programming, and compliance biases contribute necessitating careful consideration to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Privacy is paramount in health care, using public LLMs raises risks. Strict data-sharing agreements and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant training protocols are necessary to protect patient privacy. Although artificial intelligence technologies offer promising opportunities in health care, careful consideration of ethical principles is crucial. Addressing concerns of inaccuracy, bias, and privacy will ensure responsible and patient-centered implementation, benefiting both healthcare professionals and patients.",
