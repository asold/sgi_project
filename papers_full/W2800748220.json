Although these skills make it an important \navian model species for studying physical cognition, there are no scientific records of  this species using objects as \ntools in the wild. We hereby report a single observation of a feral individual, showing an object related foraging \nbehavior not previously described. The bird directly and repeatedly combined plant material (alternating betwe en \nstiff stalks and flimsy leaves) with the inside of a foraging source (open coconuts) in a continuous and very \npersistent way. Here we analyze the observation and discuss how a psychological motivation for combining objects, \nparticularly with food source s, may represent a potential new path to the onset of avian tool use. We evaluate the \npossibility that this particular case may already represent tool use and highlight the theoretical importance of this \nfinding to our present state of knowledge about the technical abilities of this species. \n \nKeywords –  Extractive foraging, Tool use, Parrot, Object combinations \n \n \nGoffin's cockatoos are opportunist parrots endemic to the Tanimbar archipelago and there are \nintroduced, self-supporting populations in Singapore (introduced around 1980; Briffett, 1984), Indonesia, \nand Puerto Rico. Ongoing field investigations on Tanimbar strongly suggest that they are neither \nspecialized nor species -wide tool users (unpublished data, ongoing field work). Nevertheless, they have \nshown the capacity for highly flexible tool  use and manufacture under laboratory conditions, rivaling the \nskills of habitually tool -using birds (Auersperg, Szabo, von Bayern , & Kacelnik, 2012; Auersperg  et al., \n2014; Auersperg, Borasinski, Laumer , & Kaceln ik, 2016; Auersperg, Köck, Pledermann, O’Hara , & \nHuber, 2017). Unlike habitually tool using birds, they do not construct complex nest cups and they lack \nfood caching ancestry, two ecological drivers that have been proposed to have prompted the onset of too l \nuse in birds (e.g., discussed in Kenward, Rutz, Weir, & Kacelnik, 2006: Hansell & Ruxton, 2008). \nHowever, the cockatoos possess several attributes that could support the onset of tool use: they \nreact flexibly and sensitively to small changes in their env ironment (e.g., Auersperg, Kacelnik, & von \nBayern, 2013 ; Auersperg, Laumer, & Bugnyar, 2013; Auersperg et al., 2016, 2017), they temporarily \ncontrol feeding impulses (Auersperg, Laumer, & Bugnyar, 2013), they use extractive foraging in the wild \n(opening various hard shelled fruits and even digging up cassava roots; unpublished data) and establish \n                                                                        Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg  230 \n \ncomplex non-functional relationships between inedible objects during object -play at similar rates as tool -\nusing New Caledonian crows (Auersperg et al., 2015). \nThe first incident of cockatoo tool manufacture in a lab occurred spontaneously outside of an \nexperimental context (Auersperg et al., 2012), and captive animals tend to show a broa der range of tool -\nusing behaviors than their wild counterparts (Haslam, 2013). There are no scientific records of these birds \nusing tools in the wild to date.  Here, we analyze observations of a feral Goffin’s cockatoo in Singapore \ncombining inedible objects with the inside of a foraging source during active extractive foraging. \n \nMethods \n \nOn the August 5, 2016, a cockatoo (eye ring/body size suggest it was an adult male) was spotted \nin Sentosa Waterfront, South of Singapore, foraging on three green coconuts through holes in their shells. \nDuring one hour, with a single break of ten minutes, he fed from the coconuts while consecutively \ncombining two different plant parts of the same tree with the inside of the fruits; one type of material was \nstiff, stick-like stalks (male flower stalks), and the other flimsy pieces of leaf. The coconut was likely less \nthan 9-10 months old, and at that point, its inside would not have been completely solid. Although we \nrecently learned that coconuts opened by Goffin’s cockatoos on Tanimbar have similar features \n(unpublished observations), the opening could also have been created by a highly common plantain \nsquirrel (Callosciurus notatus). \n  The Bird Ecology Study Group (BesGroup.org) of the Nature Society (Singapore) provided us \nwith seven videos (24  fps, total 19  hr 28 min), recorded by Ang Siew Siew (see M ovies S1, S2, S4, S6 \nand S7). All seven clips belong to the same observa tion. With one single exception, in all clips, the focal \nbird was interacting with the same coconut. In four of the videos, the bird used objects  in combination \nwith the coconut (Movies S1, S2, S4 and S7), while in the other three, there were no objects in use (these \nwere included in the analysis because they belonged to the same observation). We analyzed the video \nwith a coding scheme of 23 actions/events and se ven modifiers separated in three categories (target, \ncoconut area and movement), recording: head position relative to the coconut, object interaction (biting \nand taking), body and object readjustments, visible use of strength, part of the hole and fruit area targeted. \nAll applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were \nfollowed. No specific permissions were required for this observational and noninvasive study. A \nsignificant part of the data (Movie S1; 8 min) was doubly coded by a second rater. Inter -observer \nreliability was strong (Cohen’s Kappa value for action evens = .92, for coconut area  = .89; for target =  \n.94). \n \nResults \n \nAfter coding 324 events within 19:28 min (AOM see authors), we found 26 stalk -coconut \ncombinations (using nine different stalks), ten leaf-coconut combinations (four different ripped pieces of \nleaf) and one combination of an unidentified object with the coconut. There were 80 interactions with the \nbeak and the coconut’s hole; 27 of them pulling fibers off the open hole (using strong pulling movements \nwith the entire body), 23 insertions of the beak towards the white meat from inside (controlled insertion of \nthe beak without strong movements), 17 bitings of the hole used as a control for body position (biting the \ncoconut’s hole while changing the position of the legs) and 13 obscured. All objects were held on the \nbeak while removing fibers from t he open hole of the coconut (with one single exception of a change in \nbody position while biting the coconut with a leaf on the beak). \nStalks and leaf fragments were broken off from the area surrounding the targeted coconut; only a \nfew body readjustments w ere required to reach each leaf and stalk.  Almost all object combinations with \nthe coconut targeted the ‘bottom’ part of the fruit’s opening rather than the ‘top’ (Stalk: bottom 21, top 0, \nobscured 5; Leaf: bottom 8, top 2, obscured 0; undetermined object:  bottom 1, top 0, obscured 0) while \nthe beak-only interactions with the coconut seemed to depend on the goal: biting the white meat off the \ninside was usually constricted to the top’s inside area, while pulling fibers of the hole happened more on \n                                                                        Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg  231 \n \nthe bottom (biting insides: bottom 2, top 18, obscured 4; biting fibers of the open hole: bottom 17, top 5, \nobscured 1; biting for control position: bottom 7, top 8, obscured 1). Some leaves were readjusted but less \nfrequently than stalks, and in two occasions, were chewed (folded inside the beak) before being applied to \nthe fruit (leaves readjustments 2, leaves folded 2; stalk readjustments 18). Stalks were always employed \nin the same manner: they were gripped with the beak at the thicker end, which was then presse d into the \ncoconut’s opening by that end (see Figure 1). Pulling fibers off the open hole was done with or without \nstalks and leaves, but when an object was applied, more coconut pieces were seen falling down (19 with \nobject, two without). \n \n \nFigure 1. Typical stalk-fruit combination. Top to bottom: A piece of flower stalk is bitten off nearby the feeding site; the stalk is \ngripped at the thick end and combined with the bottom part of the coconut. \nWhen the cockatoo inserted the beak into the coconut, the mo vement patterns strongly differed \nfrom biting the fibers off the opening. Biting inside was accompanied by stretching the neck and body \ntowards the white meat (the inside can be seen along video Movie S2), it was performed without strong \nmovements, it was usually followed by a beak position of tip to tip (upper and lower tips of the beak \ntouching, as holding something), munching movements of beak/tongue (4 clear events) and, in one case, a \nwhite piece of coconut meat was extracted (Movie S7 at 1:05). \n \nDiscussion \n \nHere, we provide the first report of object combinations in an extractive  foraging context by a \nfree-ranging Goffin's cockatoo. While we previously observed object combinations by free -ranging \nconspecifics on the Tanimbar islands (unpublished data), we have so far not been able to record object \ncombinations that were aimed dire ctly against an extractive foraging source. The behavior does thus, not \nseem to be a habitual trait that is widely expressed across populations. \nNotably, the objects are not combined with another inedible item but directly with a food source \nwhile the bird is actively feeding. This is important because play usually occurs in a satiated context (e.g., \nBateson & Martin, 2013). T he behavio r is thus unlikely simply a case of combinatory object play as \npreviously reported in captive Goffin's cockatoos (Auersperg  et al., 2015) but could be part of a foraging \n                                                                        Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg  232 \n \nroutine. This is surprising as, while pre-existing behavioral patterns are believed to have played a role in \nthe onset of tool use (Alcock, 1972), those that are context-specific, such as object play, are believed to be \nhard to transfer to foraging contexts (Hunt, Gray, & Taylor, 2013).  \nWe were able to record three kinds of beak -coconut interactions within the videos: pulling fibers \nfrom the opening (with or without pressing objects against it), using the open ing as a support to change \nthe body position, and inserting the head (most likely to feed from inside the fruit). Similar to the first \nobservation of cockatoo tool use in Vienna (Auersperg et al., 2012), the combinatory behavior was shown \nby only a single individual despite other conspecifics feeding nearby, suggesting the focal bird to possibly \nbe an individual innovator. \nCockatoos from the endemic population on Tanimbar occasionally feed and even open coconuts \n(personal communication with our field team).  Nevertheless, it has been suggested that moving into a \nnovel, harsher environment may facilitate tool use -like behaviors (Alcock, 1972). Although Singapore \ndoes not seem to lack resources, it has more bird species than Tanimbar (including two other cockat oo \nspecies; see avibase.com) and the Goffins are likely to face more competition than in their original \nhabitat. \nIn the video, the combinations were frequent and directed specifically at the fibers at the opening: \nthe bird clearly held an object in 31% of the times that he interacted with the hole in the nut (49% of the \ninteractions with the opening). Moreover, while combinations of the fruit with stiff stalks were repeated \nmultiple times, combinations of the fruit with flimsy leaves were less common (26 vs . 10). Leaves \nseemed to be easier to reach than stalks and more abundant. Yet they could simply be lost earlier because \nthey were destroyed faster. Alternatively, the stalks may be more advantageous in this foraging situation. \nIt is likely that the stalks and leaves were helpful while tearing apart the fibers to enlarge the opening and \nacquiring access to the jelly -like liquid of the young fruit: Although half of the interactions with the \nopening were without objects, in those interactions where fibers were  pulled in combination with a stalk \nor a leaf many more small pieces of coconut were visible falling down. Leaves could serve as a wedge to \nsupport the bird’s grip on the fruit as has been described in others parrots and cockatoos (Borsa ri & \nOttoni, 2005; Wallace, 1890). \n  Stalks were always inserted with the thicker part first and held by the bird close to this ‘working \nend’ followed by strong lateral body movements. While the thick part might serve as a better tool to pull \nfibers as a wedge, this could be  accidental. For example, the favorable orientation of barbed pandanus \ntools by New Caledonian crows turned out to be a side effect of their manufacturing technique \n(Holzhaider, Hunt, Campbell , & Gray, 2008). The cockatoo may have simply been gripping the thicker \nend because it marks the breaking point from the plant.  \nDue the nature of this particular observation, at this point , the benefits of using these objects as \nwedges have to remain speculative. Almost every time that we can see pieces falling down (89%), there is \nan object in use, but we do not know if the use of these objects is truly helpful for the bird or just a vain \nattempt to further open the hole of the coconut. Nevertheless, importantly, intense combinations of \nobjects with food sources as de scribed in this case combined with very fast operant and social learning \nabilities, flexible extractive foraging and the capacity for tool use in captivity (Auersperg et al., 2012 , \n2016; Auersperg, Laumer, & Bugnyar, 2013 ; Auersperg, Kacelnik, & von Bayern , 2013 ) do generally \nconstitute a scenario that could easily prompt the innovation and spread of tool use in a foraging context if \nthe outcome of such a combination did prove advantageous.  \nBirds have largely been argued to develop tool use by modification  of existing ecological \nspecializations such as nest building from twigs or food caching in cavities (Alcock, 1972; Hansell & \nRuxton, 2008; Kenward et al., 2011). This species reaches levels of tools use in the lab that strongly rival \neven the most special ized non-human tool users (Auersperg el al., 2012 , 2014, 2016, 2017) but is not a \nhabitual tool user, not a nest builder and not a food cacher. Yet, they recurrently combine environmental \nobjects during play and exploration (Auersperg et al., 2015). We arg ue that a strong psychological \nmotivation to combine objects could change from play into foraging behavior if the combination of an \nobject with another accidentally provided profits to the actor: if the outcome of such a combination \nunexpectedly allowed or  facilitated access to a foraging source it could quickly become reinforced, \n                                                                        Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg  233 \n \nrefined and turn into tool use or simply enhance the inclusion of other object combinations into foraging \nroutines. This could potentially represent a new path to the onset of avian tool use.  \nWhat we can conclude from this and previous lab observations (Auersperg et al., 2012, 2015) is \nthat the Goffin's cockatoo seem to have their capacity to develop tool use and manufacture from their \nadaptive flexibility and most likely a propen sity to explore different variants of object combinations. Due \nto the consistency of this individual along the videos analyzed and their highly flexible tool use and \nmanufacture under laboratory conditions, we hypothesize that, in this species, tool use co uld \nspontaneously appear in individuals but has not spread across populations, making this a species that \ncould be in a tipping state between flexible extractive foraging and tool use. While this is a highly \nimportant starting point, future fieldwork on this species will bring further insights into their opportunistic \nforaging techniques and shed further light on these findings. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe Bird Ecology Study Group of the Nature Society, Singapore and Ang Siew Siew for providing details \nof their observation.
