The exponential growth of research papers is placing an increasing\nburden on human reviewers, making it challenging to maintain efficient and reliable\nreview processes. To address this, we explore the use of ChatGPT to assist with\nthe review process. Our experiments demonstrate that ChatGPT can review the\npapers followed by the sentiment analysis of the review of research papers and\nprovide insights into their potential for acceptance or rejection. Although our study\nis limited to a small sample of papers, the results are promising and suggest that\nfurther research in this area is warranted. We note that the use of large language\nmodels for scientific literature review is still in its early stages, and there are many\nchallenges to be addressed. Nonetheless, our work highlights the potential of these\nmodels to augment the traditional peer-review process, providing a new perspective\non research papers and potentially accelerating the pace of scientific discovery and\ninnovation.\n1 Introduction\nThe process of reviewing research papers is crucial for the advancement of scientific knowledge and\nthe dissemination of new ideas. However, with the growing volume of research being published, it\nis becoming increasingly challenging for human reviewers to keep up with the demand for review.\nThis has led to the exploration of alternative approaches to assist or even replace human reviewers,\nincluding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP).\nIn this paper, we focus on the use of large language models for reviewing research papers. Large\nlanguage models are a type of AI that have been trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform\na wide range of NLP tasks. These models have achieved impressive results on a variety of benchmarks\nand have the potential to be useful for scientific literature review.\nThe motivation for exploring this topic is twofold. First, the growing volume of research papers\nmeans that there is a need for more efficient and reliable review processes. Second, the use of large\nlanguage models for scientific literature review has the potential to provide a new perspective and\nidentify patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent to human reviewers.\n2 Literature review\nThe use of AI models to review research articles has gained significant attention in recent years due\nto the increasing volume of scholarly publications and the need to streamline the review process.\nAI models can assist in identifying the most relevant and impactful articles, evaluate the quality of\nresearch, and predict future research trends. Several studies have explored the use of AI for this task.\nIn [Mrowinski et al., 2017], the authors present a study aimed at improving the efficiency of the peer\nreview process, which is often slow and time-consuming. The study was conducted with the help\nof the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society’s dataset, which allowed the creation of an artificial\nreview thread simulation. The researchers then used Cartesian Genetic Programming, an evolutionary\nalgorithm, to search for a strategy that would decrease review time. According to the findings, the\nimplementation of the evolved strategy resulted in a 30% reduction in the duration of the peer review\nprocess, all while keeping the same pool of reviewers. The researchers were able to show that genetic\nprograms have the capability to enhance actual social systems and that their approach could lead to a\nmeasurable advancement in the efficiency of the peer review process.\nIn [Ghosal et al., 2019], the authors propose a deep neural architecture that uses sentiment information\nfrom peer review texts to predict the outcome of the review process. Their system achieves a\nsignificant improvement over existing baselines and could serve as an additional layer of confidence\nfor editors and program chairs, especially when reviewers are non-responsive or missing.\nIn [Checco et al., 2021], the authors examines the potential of using artificial intelligence (AI) to\nautomate or assist in the peer-review process. The researchers developed a machine-learning system\nand trained it with 3300 papers from three conferences, showing that the system can successfully\npredict the outcome of the peer review process based on superficial features of the manuscript. The\nstudy highlights the potential benefits of such AI tools, including greater efficiency and insights into\nthe reviewing process. However, the researchers also note the need to address potential biases and\nethical concerns associated with these tools.\nIn [pee, 2022], the authors aimed to evaluate the utility of various machine learning algorithms in\npredicting publication likelihood based on peer reviewer scores. A cross-sectional study design\nwas employed, and a sample of 263 manuscripts undergoing peer review between 2017 and 2021\nwere selected, with the final decision on acceptance or rejection used as the outcome variable. The\nperformance of different algorithms was assessed using both training and testing data and metrics\nsuch as accuracy. Results suggest that, while the performance of the machine learning algorithms\nvaried, in general they performed only moderately well in predicting publication likelihood. The\nhighest accuracy achieved was 65.2%.\nSeveral software programs now use AI for reviewing articles [Heaven, 2018]. In this article, the\nauthor mentions the software software like StatReviewer, which checks manuscript statistics and\nmethods, has been adopted by major publishing companies like Elsevier. Additionally, ScholarOne, a\ncommonly used peer-review platform, is collaborating with UNSILO, a company that uses natural\nlanguage processing and machine learning to analyze manuscripts. Another tool, statcheck [Nuijten\net al., 2016], focus on specific areas of review, such as assessing the consistency of authors’ statistics\nand reports. These programs are being implemented in various publishing and review processes and\nare garnering interest from other publishers.\nHowever, there are also several limitations and challenges to using AI for scientific literature review.\nIn [Vincent-Lamarre and Larivière, 2021], the authors analyzed a dataset of scientific manuscripts\nsubmitted to various artificial intelligence conferences and compared the linguistic characteristics\nof accepted and rejected manuscripts. They found that accepted manuscripts were less readable,\ncontained more scientific and artificial intelligence jargon, and used more abstract and less common\nwords than rejected manuscripts. Additionally, the authors found that accepted manuscripts were\nmore likely to cite the same publications and had more semantic similarity. The study’s results suggest\na possible content bias in the peer review process, with machine learning and neural network-related\ntopics being associated with greater acceptance rates. Another challenge is that AI systems may not\nfully understand the technical and domain-specific terms and concepts used in research papers, which\ncan affect their ability to accurately extract key information and evaluate the quality and novelty\nof the research. In addition, scientific papers often contain complex structures and arguments that\nmay be difficult for AI systems to interpret. There is also the question of bias in the training data\nof AI systems, which could potentially affect the system’s performance and its ability to evaluate\nresearch papers objectively. Finally, there may be ethical concerns around replacing human reviewers\nwith AI, especially if the systems are not transparent in their decision-making process. Despite these\nchallenges, the use of AI for scientific literature review is an active area of research, and there have\nbeen some promising initial results. However, there is still a need for further studies to evaluate the\nperformance and limitations of AI systems in this context, and to consider the ethical and societal\nimplications of their use.\n2\nIn this paper, we contribute to this literature by evaluating the performance of large language models,\na type of AI that has achieved impressive results on a variety of benchmarks, in reviewing research\npapers. Our analysis aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these models in this task and to\nidentify directions for future work.\n3 Methodology\nThe methodology for this study involves a two-part process. The first step involves passing the content\nof the paper through ChatGPT, using the prompt: \"As an academic reviewer, review a new paper. I\nwill add the sections of this paper below in multiple messages.\" The contents of the paper are then\nadded during the course of several messages. It is then followed by a second prompt: \"Now that you\nhave all the sections for this paper, act as an academic reviewer and mention the Summary Of The\nPaper, Strength And Weaknesses, Clarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility and the Summary Of\nThe Review.\" This prompts ChatGPT to give a comprehensive review of the paper. In the second\nstep, the ChatGPT output (review of the paper) is passed to ChatGPT for sentiment analysis. The\nsentiment analysis output can then be utilized in the decision of whether to accept or reject the paper.\nIt is important to note that acceptance of a paper also depends on the selectivity of the venue. The\nprimary focus of this study is to determine the quality of the paper.\nIn this study, a total of eleven papers were selected for analysis. The review comments of the first\nfour papers are publicly available on OpenReview. The review for these papers were made available\nafter the data cut-off date for ChatGPT. For the fifth paper, it was generated by a language model\n(ChatGPT) and no official reviews were available. The review comments for the next five papers\nwere not publicly available but are known to the author for some of the papers. Lastly, the last paper\nis still under review and the review comments are not yet publicly accessible. They will, however, be\nmade available on OpenReview at a later date.\n4 Results\n4.1 Review of papers with OpenReview available\n4.1.1 LAMP: Extracting Text from Gradients with Language Model Priors [Balunovi´c et al.,\n2022]\nSummary of the Paper: The paper presents LAMP, a method for reconstructing private text data from\ngradients using language model priors and alternating between continuous and discrete optimization.\nThe authors extensively evaluate LAMP on various datasets, architectures, and batch sizes, and show\nthat it consistently outperforms prior work in text reconstruction from gradients. The authors also\ndemonstrate that LAMP is effective in reconstructing private data in challenging settings such as\nfine-tuned models and noise-defended gradients.\nStrengths: The paper presents a new method for text reconstruction from gradients that leverages\nlanguage model priors and achieves strong results in a wide range of settings. The authors provide\na thorough experimental evaluation of LAMP, including comparisons with prior work and ablation\nstudies. The paper discusses the limitations of current federated learning algorithms in protecting\nprivate text data and the need for further research in this area.\nWeaknesses: The paper assumes knowledge of the ground truth labels for the private text data, which\nmay not always be possible in practice. The effectiveness of LAMP in reconstructing private text\ndata in the masking setting, as considered in prior work, is not evaluated.\nClarity: The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The authors provide clear explanations of\nthe LAMP method and its components, as well as a detailed description of the experimental setup\nand results.\nQuality: The paper presents a novel and effective method for text reconstruction from gradients, and\nprovides a thorough evaluation of its performance. The experimental results are presented in a clear\nand comprehensive manner, and the limitations of the method are discussed.\n3\nNovelty: LAMP is a novel method for text reconstruction from gradients that leverages language\nmodel priors and alternating optimization. To the best of my knowledge, this approach has not been\npreviously proposed in the literature.\nReproducibility: The authors provide a detailed description of the experimental setup and results,\nmaking it possible to reproduce the experiments. However, the code for the LAMP method and the\nexperimental evaluation is not publicly available.\nSummary of the Review: Overall, the paper presents a strong contribution in the area of text\nreconstruction from gradients, introducing a novel method that achieves strong results in a wide\nrange of settings. The experimental evaluation is thorough and the results are clearly presented.\nHowever, the assumption of knowledge of ground truth labels and the lack of code availability may\nbe limitations.\n4.1.2 Masked Prediction: A Parameter Identifiability View [Liu et al.]\nSummary of the Paper: The paper studies the problem of parameter identifiability in the context\nof self-supervised learning (SSL) using masked prediction tasks. Specifically, the authors consider\ntwo types of data generative models - hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditionally-Gaussian\nhidden Markov models (G-HMMs) - and analyze the identifiability of their parameters under various\nmasked prediction tasks. The authors show that the identifiability of the parameters depends on\nthe combination of the data generative model and the prediction task, and provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for identifiability in both cases.\nStrengths: One strength of the paper is that it provides a novel perspective on SSL by studying the\nproblem of parameter identifiability. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the identifiability\nof the parameters of HMMs and G-HMMs under various masked prediction tasks, and provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability in both cases.\nWeaknesses: The paper assumes that the hidden state space is discrete and of a fixed size, which\nmay limit the applicability of the results to real-world data.\nClarity: The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide clear definitions and\nassumptions, and the main results are presented in a clear and concise manner.\nQuality: The results in the paper are well-motivated and the authors provide a thorough analysis of\nthe identifiability of the parameters of HMMs and G-HMMs under various masked prediction tasks.\nThe authors also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability in both cases, which\nadds to the quality of the paper.\nNovelty and Reproducibility: To the best of my knowledge, the problem of parameter identifiability\nin the context of SSL using masked prediction tasks has not been studied before. The results in the\npaper are novel and provide a new perspective on SSL. The authors also provide sufficient details and\nexamples to make the results reproducible.\nSummary of the Review: Overall, the paper is a well-written and well-motivated study of the\nproblem of parameter identifiability in the context of SSL using masked prediction tasks. The authors\nprovide a thorough analysis of the identifiability of the parameters of HMMs and G-HMMs under\nvarious masked prediction tasks, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability in\nboth cases. The results are novel and provide a new perspective on SSL. However, the assumption\nthat the hidden state space is discrete and of a fixed size may limit the applicability of the results to\nreal-world data.\n4.1.3 Evident: a Development Methodology and a Knowledge Base Topology for Data Mining,\nMachine Learning and General Knowledge Management [Haidar et al., 2022]\nSummary of the Paper: This paper presents a new project development and artifact management\nmethodology called Evident, which is intended to address various pain points in the fields of data\nmining (DM), machine learning (ML) and knowledge management (KM). The methodology is based\non the idea of breaking down projects into two granular levels: Knowledges and Containers, which\nare essentially collections of observations, hypotheses and tests. The paper describes how Evident\ncan be used to represent different types of knowledge (inductive, abductive and deductive), and how it\n4\ncan be applied to DM, ML and KM in order to improve the reproducibility, measurability, trackability\nand scalability of these fields.\nStrengths: One of the strengths of this paper is that it presents a clear and concise overview of the\nEvident methodology, including its definitions, scope, and application to DM, ML and KM. The\npaper also provides a number of examples to illustrate how Evident can be used to address specific\npain points in these fields.\nWeaknesses: One potential weakness of the paper is that it does not provide a detailed evaluation of\nEvident in terms of its effectiveness or practicality. While the authors do provide some arguments\nfor why Evident may be useful, it would be helpful to see more concrete evidence of its success or\nfailure in real-world projects.\nClarity: Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors do a good job of explaining\nthe key concepts and ideas behind Evident, and the examples provided are helpful in illustrating these\nconcepts.\nQuality: The quality of the paper is generally good, with a clear and well-organized structure. The\nideas presented are well-supported by examples and the writing is clear and concise.\nNovelty and Reproducibility: The Evident methodology described in this paper appears to be novel,\nas it is not mentioned in other literature on DM, ML and KM. It is not clear, however, how easily the\nmethodology can be reproduced in different contexts or how widely it has been adopted in practice.\nSummary of the Review: This paper presents a new methodology called Evident, which is intended\nto address various pain points in DM, ML and KM. The methodology is based on the idea of breaking\ndown projects into Knowledges and Containers, and is described in detail in the paper. While the\npaper provides a clear and concise overview of Evident, more information about its effectiveness or\npracticality in real-world projects would be helpful. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, and\nthe ideas presented are well-supported by examples. The Evident methodology appears to be novel,\nbut it is not clear how easily it can be reproduced. More details and examples of how Evident can be\napplied in specific projects would be helpful in understanding the practicalities and potential benefits\nof this methodology. Additionally, a more thorough comparison to existing project development\nand artifact management approaches, such as agile methodologies, would be useful in evaluating\nthe novelty and potential impact of Evident. Overall, the quality of the paper is good, but more\nclarification and elaboration on the proposed methodology and its potential applications would be\nbeneficial.\n4.1.4 Understanding Why Generalized Reweighting Does Not Improve Over ERM [Zhai\net al., 2022]\nSummary of the Paper: The paper studies the performance of generalized reweighting (GRW)\nalgorithms, a class of methods that aim to address distributional shift in machine learning tasks.\nThe authors first prove that for linear models and sufficiently wide fully-connected neural networks,\nthe implicit bias of GRW is equivalent to empirical risk minimization (ERM) when trained for an\ninfinitely long time, and that regularization must be large enough to significantly lower the training\nperformance in order to affect this implicit bias. The authors then show that for classification tasks\nusing the logistic loss, any GRW algorithm satisfying a certain assumption has the same implicit\nbias as ERM, and that any GRW algorithm satisfying a different assumption has its training error\nconverge to 0 and its model weight direction converge, leading to the same implicit bias as ERM.\nThe authors also discuss promising directions for improving the distributionally robust generalization\nof GRW algorithms, including data augmentation and pretraining, going beyond sample reweighting\nbased GRW algorithms, and changing the loss function to be better suited for GRW.\nStrengths: One strength of the paper is its thorough analysis of the implicit bias of GRW algorithms\nand its comparison to ERM. The authors provide clear and rigorous proofs of their results and discuss\ntheir limitations in detail.\nWeaknesses: A weakness of the paper is its reliance on strong assumptions, including the use of\nlinear models and sufficiently wide fully-connected neural networks and the assumption that the\nmodels are trained for an infinitely long time.\nClarity: The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors clearly state their assumptions\nand provide detailed explanations and proofs of their results.\n5\nQuality: The results of the paper are sound and well-supported by rigorous proof. The authors also\nprovide meaningful insights into the limitations and future directions for GRW algorithms.\nNovelty and Reproducibility: The paper presents new theoretical results on the implicit bias of\nGRW algorithms and its comparison to ERM. The authors also provide detailed explanations and\nproofs of their results, making the paper highly reproducible.\nSummary of the Review: This is a strong paper that provides valuable insights into the performance\nof GRW algorithms in addressing distributional shift. The results are well-supported by rigorous\nproof and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The limitations and future directions discussed\nby the authors are also valuable contributions to the field. Overall, this is a high-quality and novel\npaper that should be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning and distributional shift.\n4.2 Review of a paper written by ChatGPT\n4.2.1 A Day in the Life of ChatGPT as a researcher: Sustainable and Efficient Machine\nLearning - A Review of Sparsity Techniques and Future Research Directions [Mashrin\nSrivastava, 2023]\nSummary of the paper: This paper provides an overview of the use of sparsity in machine learning,\nincluding techniques for inducing sparsity, sparse training algorithms, and hardware support for\nsparse training. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of using sparsity in large-scale\nneural networks and proposes several directions for future research in this area.\nStrengths: One strength of the paper is that it provides a comprehensive overview of the use of\nsparsity in machine learning, covering a wide range of techniques and domains. The paper also\ndoes a good job of highlighting the challenges and limitations of using sparsity in large-scale neural\nnetworks, as well as proposing several directions for future research.\nWeaknesses: One weakness of the paper is that it does not provide in-depth coverage of any specific\nsparsity techniques or applications. While the paper covers a wide range of topics, it does not delve\ninto the details of any specific techniques or provide any experimental results.\nClarity: The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand. The organization and structure\nof the paper are clear, and the language used is appropriate for the intended audience.\nQuality: Overall, the quality of the paper is good. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of\nthe use of sparsity in machine learning and covers a wide range of topics. However, as mentioned\nabove, the paper does not provide in-depth coverage of any specific sparsity techniques or applications\nand does not include any experimental results.\nNovelty and reproducibility: The paper does not present any new research findings or contributions.\nInstead, it provides an overview of existing techniques and challenges in the use of sparsity in machine\nlearning. As such, the paper’s novelty is limited. However, the paper is well-referenced and includes\na wide range of relevant literature, which makes it potentially useful as a resource for researchers\ninterested in the topic.\nSummary of the review: Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the use of\nsparsity in machine learning. It covers a wide range of topics and does a good job of highlighting\nthe challenges and limitations of using sparsity in large-scale neural networks. While the paper is\nwell-written and easy to understand, it does not provide in-depth coverage of any specific sparsity\ntechniques or applications and does not present any new research findings or contributions. As such,\nthe paper’s novelty is limited, but it may be useful as a resource for researchers interested in the topic.\n4.3 Review of other papers\n4.3.1 Clinico-genomic analysis reveals mutations associated with COVID-19 disease severity:\npossible modulation by RNA structure [Mehta et al., 2021]\nSummary of the paper: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic\nmutations of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 in a group of 196 patients in India. The\npatients were divided into recovered (R) and deceased (D) groups, and the R group was further divided\ninto mild, moderate, and severe categories based on the extent of respiratory support required. The\nresearchers identified three dominant clades of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient samples and conducted\n6\nan association study between the presence of certain mutations and disease severity and mortality.\nThey found that the A26194T, C28854T, and C25611A mutations were significantly associated with\nsevere and fatal cases. The researchers then conducted structural analysis on these three mutations\nand found that they caused changes in the viral proteins and RNA that could potentially affect viral\nreplication and host immune response.\nStrengths: One strength of this study is the large sample size of 196 patients, which allows for more\nrobust conclusions to be drawn. Additionally, the use of both Oxford Nanopore and Illumina-Miseq\nsequencing platforms increases the reliability of the genomic data.\nWeaknesses: However, one potential weakness is that the study only includes patients from one\nhospital in India, which may not be representative of the entire population. It would have been\ninteresting to see if the results of this study are consistent with those from other studies conducted in\ndifferent countries.\nClarity: The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The materials and methods section is\ndetailed and provides sufficient information for the study to be reproduced. However, the introduction\ncould benefit from more context and a clear statement of the research question.\nQuality: The study appears to be well-conducted with appropriate controls and statistical analy-\nses. The use of multiple sequencing platforms and the large sample size add to the quality of the\nstudy. However, as mentioned above, the limited geographic location of the study may limit the\ngeneralizability of the results.\nNovelty and reproducibility: The study provides new insights into the relationship between SARS-\nCoV-2 mutations and COVID-19 severity, and the structural analysis of selected mutations adds to the\nunderstanding of how these mutations may affect viral function. The materials and methods section\nprovides sufficient detail for the study to be reproduced.\nSummary of the review: Overall, this is a well-conducted study that provides new insights into\nthe relationship between SARS-CoV-2 mutations and COVID-19 severity. The large sample size\nand use of multiple sequencing platforms add to the reliability of the results. However, the limited\ngeographic location of the study may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further research in\nother populations would be useful to confirm the results of this study.\n4.3.2 COVID-19 Risk Stratification and Mortality Prediction in Hospitalized Indian Patients:\nHarnessing clinical data for public health benefits [Alle et al., 2022]\nSummary of the paper: This paper presents the results of a study that analyzed the clinical data of\n544 COVID-19 patients in India in order to develop artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions for\nrisk stratification and mortality prediction. The authors used various machine learning algorithms\nto analyze the data and found that existing mortality prediction models trained on a different cohort\n(Wuhan, China) performed poorly when applied to the Indian cohort. They also found that the best\nperforming model for risk stratification on the Indian data was an XGboost classifier, while the\nbest performing model for mortality prediction was a logistic regression model. The authors found\nthat hematological parameters, such as blood coagulation parameters, immune and inflammation\nparameters, and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, were important features for both risk stratification\nand mortality prediction models. The authors also observed that steroids might have played a role in\npatient survival with extreme neutrophils or lymphocytes.\nStrengths: The study is the first to develop predictive models for COVID-19 outcomes in an Indian\ncohort. The use of machine learning algorithms allows for fast and accurate predictions. The study\nincludes a large number of patients (544) and a wide range of parameters (70 unique features).\nWeaknesses: The study only includes patients from a single hospital in New Delhi, which may\nlimit the generalizability of the findings to other regions or populations. The study only includes\npatients who were admitted to the hospital, which may not accurately represent the overall COVID-19\npopulation in India. The performance of the models could have been further improved by using more\nadvanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning. Clarity: The paper is well written\nand easy to understand. The methods, results, and discussion sections are clearly presented and the\nfigures and tables help in understanding the results.\nQuality: The study uses a large dataset and employs appropriate statistical methods for the analysis.\nThe performance of the developed models is also evaluated using appropriate metrics.\n7\nNovelty and reproducibility: The paper appears to be well written and the methodology used is\nclear and easy to understand. The use of machine learning algorithms for risk stratification and\nmortality prediction in COVID-19 patients is a novel approach, and the results obtained in this study\nare quite promising. The use of data from Indian COVID-19 patients is also a unique aspect of this\nstudy, as previous studies have primarily focused on data from other countries. The results of this\nstudy are reproducible, as the authors have provided detailed information about the data collection,\npreprocessing, and modeling steps.\nSummary Of The Review Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the clinical characteris-\ntics of COVID-19 patients in India and the potential use of machine learning for risk stratification and\nmortality prediction. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger and more diverse\npatient populations.\n4.3.3 Automated emergency paramedical response system [Srivastava et al., 2018]\nSummary of the paper: The paper presents a telemedicine system called AEPRS (Airborne Emer-\ngency and Primary Response System) that uses drones for medical delivery, a chatbot for disease\ndetection, and a private blockchain for medical records. The system also includes a module for stroke\ndetection in community hospitals using image processing and machine learning techniques, and a\nface recognition module using edge AI.\nStrengths: The use of drones for medical delivery and a chatbot for disease detection are innovative\nideas that have the potential to improve the efficiency and accessibility of healthcare services,\nparticularly in remote or underserved areas. The inclusion of a private blockchain for medical records\naddresses the issue of secure and controlled access to patient data. The stroke detection module and\nthe face recognition module demonstrate the potential applications of machine learning and AI in\nhealthcare.\nWeaknesses: The paper lacks sufficient details on the implementation and performance of the\ndifferent modules of the AEPRS system. For example, it is not clear how the chatbot works, what\nkind of diseases it can detect, and how accurate it is. The paper also lacks a thorough discussion\non the potential challenges and limitations of using drones for medical delivery, such as regulatory\nissues, safety, and security.\nClarity: The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. However, some of the technical\ndetails and descriptions of the different modules could be clearer and more comprehensive.\nQuality: The paper lacks a proper evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the AEPRS\nsystem. It only provides some preliminary results for the stroke detection module, but does not\nprovide any quantitative or qualitative analysis of the results.\nNovelty: The idea of using drones for medical delivery and a chatbot for disease detection is novel,\nbut the paper does not provide enough details or comparisons to assess the novelty and impact of the\nAEPRS system.\nReproducibility: It is not clear how the AEPRS system was developed and tested, and whether it\ncan be reproduced by other researchers or practitioners.\nSummary of the review: Overall, the paper presents some interesting and potentially useful ideas for\nusing technology to improve healthcare services. However, it lacks sufficient details and evaluation\nof the different modules of the AEPRS system, and does not address some of the potential challenges\nand limitations of the proposed solutions.\n4.3.4 Sentiment Analysis: Predicting Yelp Scores [Guda et al., 2022]\nSummary of the Paper: The paper presents an analysis of several machine learning and deep\nlearning models for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. The authors consider both binary\n(positive vs negative sentiment) and multi-class (1-5 star ratings) classification tasks, and experiment\nwith various input feature sets (meta features, review text, and both). They find that deep learning\nmodels, particularly those with attention mechanisms, outperform the other models, and that the joint\nuse of meta features and review text is beneficial for all models.\nStrengths: A strength of the paper is that it thoroughly investigates a range of models and input\nfeature sets, and presents clear results and analysis.\n8\nWeaknesses: A weakness is that the analysis of model interpretability is limited to qualitative\nexamples rather than more systematic or quantitative analysis.\nClarity: The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The methods and results are described in\nsufficient detail.\nQuality: The research is well-conducted and the results are sound. The use of multiple datasets and\nevaluation metrics adds to the robustness of the study.\nNovelty and Reproducibility: The paper presents a thorough comparison of different models for\nsentiment analysis of restaurant reviews, which is a common problem in the field. The results\nof the study are potentially useful for practitioners looking to choose a model for this task. The\nauthors provide sufficient detail about the datasets, preprocessing, and experimental setup to allow\nfor reproduction of the study.\nSummary of the Review: Overall, the paper presents a thorough and well-conducted analysis of\ndifferent models for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. The results and analysis are clearly\npresented and the study is well-written and easy to follow. The use of multiple datasets and evaluation\nmetrics adds to the robustness of the study. The paper is a useful resource for practitioners looking to\nchoose a model for this task. One potential area for improvement would be to include more systematic\nor quantitative analysis of model interpretability.\n4.3.5 Smart City: An Intelligent Automated Mode of Transport Using Shortest Time of\nTravel Using Big Data [Srivastava et al., 2022]\nSummary of the paper: The paper proposes the use of a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm for au-\ntonomous transportation in order to minimize travel time rather than distance. The approach in-\ncorporates ant colony optimization and makes use of big data analytics and cloud computing. The\nperformance of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the time saved with the original\nDijkstra’s algorithm for different map types.\nStrengths: The problem of minimizing travel time in autonomous transportation is important and\nrelevant. The proposed approach of using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm and incorporating ant\ncolony optimization is novel.\nWeaknesses: The technical details of the proposed approach and the modifications made to the\nDijkstra’s algorithm are not clearly explained. The data and settings used in the analysis are not\nsufficiently described. The results are not thoroughly analyzed or discussed.\nClarity: The paper could benefit from improved organization and clarity, particularly in the descrip-\ntion of the proposed approach and its components. There are some typos and grammatical errors that\ncould be corrected.\nQuality: More information is needed on the technical details and methodology of the proposed\napproach in order to fully assess its quality. The evaluation of the results could be more thorough and\ninclude statistical analysis.\nNovelty and reproducibility: The proposed approach of using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm and\nincorporating ant colony optimization appears to be novel. It is not clear how the work could be\nreproduced, as the technical details and methodology are not sufficiently described.\nSummary of the review: The paper presents a novel approach for autonomous transportation using a\nmodified Dijkstra’s algorithm and ant colony optimization, but the technical details and methodology\nare not clearly explained. The data and settings used in the analysis are also not sufficiently described.\nThe results are not thoroughly analyzed or discussed. The paper could benefit from improved\norganization and clarity, and more information is needed in order to fully assess the quality and\nreproducibility of the work.\n4.4 Review of paper with pending official review\n4.4.1 Predicting COVID-19 case status from self-reported symptoms and behaviors using\ndata from a massive online survey [Srivastava et al., 2023]\nSummary of the paper: This paper presents a machine learning (ML) model for predicting COVID-19\ncase status using data from the US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS). The CTIS data\n9\nPaper Section ChatGPT Actual Decision Venue\n4.1.1 Mainly positive Accept (Certain) NeurIPS\n4.1.2 Mainly positive Accept (Certain) NeurIPS\n4.1.3 Neutral Reject (Certain) NeurIPS\n4.1.4 Mainly positive Reject (Less certain)* NeurIPS\n4.2.1 Neutral N/A Preprint\n4.3.1 Mainly positive Accept MDPI Pathogens\n4.3.2 Mainly positive Accept PLoS One\n4.3.3 Neutral with a slightly negative tone Accept Springer HISS\n4.3.4 Neutral N/A Preprint\n4.3.5 Mainly negative Accept Springer Nature\n4.4.1 Mainly positive N/A Under review\nTable 1: Result for sentiment analysis of reviews\nincludes information on symptoms, testing, demographics, behaviors, and vaccination status. The\nML model was trained on 12.41 million responses from the survey and achieved an F1 score of 94\nStrength and Weaknesses: The strength of the model lies in its ability to accurately predict COVID-\n19 case status using data from a large survey. The model was able to achieve a high accuracy of 94%,\nwhich is an improvement on existing models. The weakness of the model is that it is limited by the\nquality and availability of data on symptoms, which can vary over time and location.\nClarity: The paper is well written and easy to understand. The authors clearly explain their\nmethodology and the results of their analysis.\nQuality: The methods and results presented in this paper are of a high quality. The authors have\nconducted a thorough analysis of the data and have carefully evaluated the performance of their\nmodels.\nNovelty and Reproducibility: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting COVID-19 case\nstatus using survey data. The methods used in this paper are clearly explained and the authors have\nprovided detailed instructions for replicating their results.\nSummary of the Review: This paper presents a machine learning model for predicting COVID-19\ncase status using data from the US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey. The model was able to\nachieve an F1 score of 94%, which is an improvement on existing models. The paper is well written\nand of a high quality, and the methods and results presented are novel and reproducible.\n5 Discussion\nIt is observed that all papers, namely 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.4, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2, where ChatGPT’s sentiment\nanalysis outputs mainly positive results for its own review, have been accepted at prestigious confer-\nences or journals. It is worth noting that 4.1.4 was initially rejected from NeurIPS with less certainty\nbut was later accepted to ICLR, another top venue. Hence, the prediction of ChatGPTs is inline with\nthe quality of the article. Also, please note that the paper 4.4.1 is currently under review, although\nChatGPT’s sentiment analysis output for its review of that paper is also mainly positive. In addition,\nthree papers, specifically 4.1.3, 4.2.1, and 4.3.3, have received a neutral sentiment analysis output\nfrom ChatGPT. Among them, the first paper was rejected from a prominent conference, the second\npaper did not undergo peer review, and the third paper was accepted for publication in a special issue\nof a journal. One paper, identified by the reference number 4.3.5, was evaluated by ChatGPT as\nhaving a predominantly negative sentiment. Despite this, the paper was accepted for publication as a\nbook chapter. It is worth noting, however, that the paper had been rejected by several other venues,\nsuggesting that ChatGPT’s evaluation of the paper may indeed be accurate.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have explored the potential of large language models for assisting with the process of\nscientific literature review. Our analysis shows that there is promise in using AI techniques to augment\nthe traditional peer-review process. Specifically, our experiments with ChatGPT have demonstrated\n10\nthat it is possible to use large language models to assess the sentiment of research papers and provide\ninsights into their potential for acceptance or rejection. Our study indicates that utilizing ChatGPT’s\nreview of a paper, followed by a sentiment analysis of the review, can aid in predicting whether a\npaper will be accepted or rejected for publication. Specifically, we found that predominantly positive\nsentiment analysis outputs correspond to higher chances of acceptance, while negative or neutral\nresults suggest a lower likelihood of acceptance. Although our analysis is restricted to a small sample\nof papers, the outcomes exhibit potential and imply that more research in this field is required.\nIt is worth noting that the use of large language models for scientific literature review is still in its\ninfancy, and there are many challenges to be addressed. However, our work highlights the potential\nof these models to help address the growing demand for efficient and reliable review processes, and\nto provide a new perspective on research papers that may not be immediately apparent to human\nreviewers. In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that the use of large language models for\nscientific literature review has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers and publishers alike.\nWith continued research and development in this area, it is possible that using large language models\nlike ChatGPT may eventually become a standard part of the scientific review process, helping to\naccelerate the pace of scientific discovery and innovation.\nReferences\nUtility of machine learning in predicting success of a peer review paper from peer re-\nviewer scores, Nov 2022.
