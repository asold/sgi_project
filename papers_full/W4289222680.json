How-\never, developmental data on it regarding the great apes other than chimpanzees is insufficient. We conducted a longitudinal \ninvestigation of humans and chimpanzees as well as a cross-sectional examination of other great-ape infants (two bonobos, \nthree gorillas, and four orangutans) in captive settings by using two kinds of tasks that required either inserting or stacking \ncombinatory action. The four species of great apes and humans demonstrated both types of combinatory object manipulation \nduring infancy. However, the order of development in different types of combinatory object manipulations varied among the \ngreat apes. Furthermore, we applied a nesting-cup task to examine the hierarchical complexity in the combinatory strategies \nof human children and adult chimpanzees. Both of them exhibited highly hierarchical combinations in the nesting-cup task \nand employed the subassembly strategy, indicating that an action merge may exist not only in human children but also in adult \nchimpanzees. The results were discussed with reviews of the tool-use literature from the wild great apes. The early acquisition \nof an inserting action in the chimpanzees may explain the tool utilization commonality reported in wild chimpanzees. The \ncombinatory object manipulation may have worked as an external enhancer to achieve an additional hierarchical complexity \nin cognition and behavior, eventually leading humans to develop a language system.\nKeywords Object manipulation · Material intelligence · Great apes · Humans · Hierarchical complexity · Cognitive \ndevelopment\nIntroduction\nWhat is the evolutionary underpinning of the human lan-\nguage? Comparing cognition in human and nonhuman pri-\nmates of different developmental stages using a unitary scale \nwould provide valuable clues to answer this question (Vau-\nclair and Bard 1983; Hayashi and Matsuzawa 2003; Hayashi \nand Takeshita 2021). Fujita and Fujita (2021, in this vol-\nume) discussed the evolutionary continuity between human \nlanguage and nonhuman animals’ cognitive capacities by \napplying a linguistic term, “Merge,” as a key concept. Merge \nhas been illustrated as an important issue in human linguis-\ntics (Berwick et al. 2013) and can be defined as a recursive \noperation that takes two syntactic objects and forms an unor-\ndered set. If we apply this term to the manipulatory actions \nof primates, including humans, merge in human language \ncorresponds to combinatory object manipulations, which is \na precursor of tool-using behavior.\nCombinatory object manipulation\nCombinatory object manipulation has been studied in cross-\nspecies comparison (Torigoe 1985) and from developmental \nperspectives (Takeshita 2001). Torigoe (1985) reported that \namong 74 species of tested primates, great apes exhibited the \nhighest repertoire of combinatory object manipulation (iden-\ntified as ‘secondary manipulation’ in the study), followed \nEvolutionary origins of human language\n * Misato Hayashi \n hayashi-misato@chubu-gu.ac.jp\n1 Chubu Gakuin University, 30-1 Naka Oida-cho, \nKakamigahara, Gifu 504-0837, Japan\n2 Japan Monkey Centre, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan\n3 Otemon Gakuin University, Ibaraki, Osaka, Japan\n430 Primates (2022) 63:429–441\n1 3\nby cebus monkeys, macaques, guenons, mangabeys, and \nbaboons, although the other species did not combine objects \nduring manipulative actions. Takeshita (2001) reported that \ninfant chimpanzees, aged 2–4 years, readily exhibited com-\nbinatory object manipulation comparable to that of 1-year-\nold human infants. Moreover, both infant chimpanzees and \nhumans during the language-acquisition period exhibited \nsimilar motor characteristics: repetition, adjustment, and \nreversal of actions and shifts of attention. Based on the \nfundamental ability of combinatory object manipulation, \nsome primates proceeded to use an object as a tool in their \nnatural habitat. The rich repertoire of tool-using behaviors \nindicates high levels of cognitive development and material \nintelligence that characterizes the chimpanzee and human \nlineages (McGrew 2010, 2013). The first part of the present \nstudy aimed to add developmental data on object manipu-\nlation in four species of great apes and human children to \ninvestigate their cognitive development with special focus on \ntwo types of combinatory object manipulation: insertion and \nstacking. The second part examined the levels of hierarchical \ncomplexity inherent in object manipulation and the gram-\nmatical strategies applied in combining objects in humans \nand chimpanzees.\nObject‑manipulation tasks as a comparative \nscale\nObject manipulation has been employed as a comparative \nscale of cognitive development among primates, including \nhumans. Combinatory object manipulation is a good indica-\ntor of cognitive development; it starts approximately when a \nhuman is 10 months old (Tanaka and Tanaka 1982). Three \nmother-reared chimpanzees in a captive setting initiated it \nat 8–11 months of age, which was comparable to that in \nhumans (Hayashi and Matsuzawa 2003). Among its four \ntypes that were performed in the previous study, inserting \nactions were commonly observed in chimpanzees from an \nearly age, while stacking-block behaviors started later, as \ncompared to humans.\nThe three mother-reared chimpanzees were constantly \nexposed to their mothers’ stacking-block behaviors during \nthe initial 3 years of their lives without any feedback from \nhumans (Hayashi and Matsuzawa 2003; Hayashi 2007a). \nAmong them, a female chimpanzee named Pal started \nstacking up blocks when she was 2 years and 7 months old. \nAll three chimpanzees began performing this action when \nhuman experimenters conducted active training with posi-\ntive reinforcements; this began when they were 3 years and \n1 month old (Hayashi 2007a). After the stacking action’s \nacquisition, both chimpanzees and humans demonstrated \nsimilar performances in tasks using blocks of various shapes \nthat were designed to assess their understanding of physical \ncausality regarding combinatory manipulation (Hayashi and \nTakeshita 2009a).\nNesting‑cup tasks and human language\nFurthermore, the nesting-cup tasks require insertion actions, \na form of combinatory object manipulation. Greenfield et al. \n(1972) first applied it to assess cognitive development in \nhuman children aged 0–3 years. It was found that the same \ndevelopmental order existed in both manipulative strategies \nand certain grammatical constructions. Human infants begin \nto combine two cups together (pairing), develop to combine \nthree or more cups by sequentially adding a single cup to an \nexisting unit of cups (pot), and then, combine three or more \ncups by manipulating an existing unit of multiple cups to be \ncombined with a cup or unit (subassembly) (see Fig. 2 for an \nillustration). The authors specifically focused on the “subas-\nsembly” strategy, wherein a previously constructed structure \nconsisting of two or more cups is moved as a unit into or \nonto another cup or cup structure. The subassembly strat-\negy appeared in the final stage of development (observed \nonly after 20 months in human children); thus, it is the most \nadvanced combinatory strategy (Greenfield 1972). Green-\nfield ( 1991) elaborated on this idea and suggested that a \ncommon neural substrate underlies the hierarchical struc-\nture in the development of human language and combina -\ntory object manipulation, including tool use. The definition \nof the subassembly strategy is similar to that of merge in \nhuman linguistics. Application of the subassembly strategy \nlargely increases the flexibility of the sequential order of \ncup combinations. If one is only employing the pot strat-\negy to successfully seriate all provided cups into a nesting \nstructure with the least number of moves, one needs to judge \nthe relative size of the cups and start inserting the second \nlargest cup into the largest cup and so on, without an error. \nHowever, if one employs the subassembly strategy, one can \nstart by pairing any two similar-sized cups to make a unit \nas the first step and continue to judge the similarity of sizes \nbetween the two items.\nThe nesting-cup tasks have been applied to nonhuman \nprimates as a comparative scale of cognitive development \n(Matsuzawa 1991; Johnson-Pynn et al. 1999; Johnson-Pynn \nand Fragaszy 2001; Fragaszy et al. 2002). However, the sub-\nassembly strategy was employed by all the tested species \nof cebus monkeys and great apes that possess the ability of \ncombinatory object manipulation (although the frequency \nof subassembly strategy was not clear in some studies) and \nfailed to illuminate the species differences. These results \nmay be explained by the fact that the original categories used \nby Greenfield (1972) were applied by focusing on the pres-\nence of the subassembly strategy during the entire process \nof making the final structure. Thus, to assess the process of \n431Primates (2022) 63:429–441 \n1 3\ncrafting hierarchical combinations, a new notation system of \naction grammar was invented to reveal additionally precise \npatterns in their sequential combination (Hayashi 2007b). \nThree elements of object manipulation were extracted: \nwhich “object” was manipulated in which “action” and \nrelated to which “location.” In contrast with previous stud-\nies that judged the entire process for categorization, each \ncombinatory object manipulation was categorized into either \npairing, pot, or subassembly strategies (see Methods for an \nexample). Accordingly, the efficiency of cup combinations \nwas assessed and compared in humans and chimpanzees of \nvarious ages (Hayashi and Takeshita 2009b); both indicated \nsimilar trial-and-error strategies in creating hierarchical \ncombinations among multiple nesting cups.\nHierarchical complexity in object \nmanipulation\nRegarding hierarchical complexity, previous studies have \nreported varying results in different circumstances. Matsu-\nzawa (1996) applied the “tree structure analysis” to illumi-\nnate the object manipulation’s hierarchical structure and tool \nuse among wild chimpanzees. The latter’s most frequent pat-\nterns were categorized as “Level 1,” where an object (tool) \nis merged/combined with another one (target) with a single \ncombinatory relation. A group of wild chimpanzees in Bos-\nsou, Guinea, West Africa, used a pair of stones to crack \nopen nuts; this falls into the “Level 2” category, where a nut \n(target) is placed on an anvil stone (the first tool) and sub-\nsequently hit by a hammer one (the second tool) using two \nkinds of combinations among three objects. Additionally, \ninfrequent occurrences of “Level 3” tool utilization were \nreported in the Bossou chimpanzees, where a wedge stone \n(the first tool) supported an anvil one (the second tool); a \nnut (target) was positioned on the latter and smashed using \na hammerstone (the third tool) with three combinations of \nfour objects. Although the intentional insertion of the wedge \nstone has been questioned in chimpanzees (Hayashi 2015), \nthis was considered as having the most hierarchically com-\nplex structure in the tool-using behavior reported in wild \nchimpanzees.\nContrastingly, the nesting-cup tasks applied to captive \nchimpanzees indicated that a considerably higher level of \nhierarchical complexity could be achieved in terms of the \nnumber of items combined into a nesting structure (Hayashi \n2007b). The task provides clear feedback on success/failure \nregarding cup seriation. Moreover, when multiple cups are \ncombined into a nested structure, it can be moved as a unit \nto be merged with other cup(s), realizing the “subassem-\nbly” strategies. These two factors may have promoted more \ncups to be added into the nesting structure, enabling the \nmaximum record of conjoining up to ten cups in a seriation \nperformed by a female chimpanzee named Ai, who received \nartificial language training (Matsuzawa 1991). If we focus \nonly on the number of combined objects, a clear difference \nis observed between the achievements in the wild and cap-\ntive task settings. In this study, we attempted to highlight the \nhierarchical structure and its complexity in object manipu-\nlation and tool use during cognitive development in human \nand nonhuman primates.\nScopes of the two studies\nThe great apes are the most closely related evolutionary \nrelatives of human beings and are categorized in the same \n“Hominidae” family. However, the data on their cognitive \ndevelopment observed in object manipulation by the great \napes other than chimpanzees have been limited (Bard 1995; \nGomez 1999). Thus, the first part of this study aimed at \ncomparing the developmental trajectory of combinatory \nobject manipulation in human children and great ape infants \nunder captive settings by using identical tasks to gain data \non broader species-based comparison. In the current study, \nwe conducted a longitudinal investigation of humans and \nchimpanzees as well as a cross-sectional examination of \nthree other great apes (two bonobos, three gorillas, and four \norangutans) in captive settings by using object-manipulation \ntasks that required either inserting or stacking combinatory \nactions. These two types of combinatory object manipula-\ntions appeared at different times during the development of \nchimpanzees (Hayashi and Matsuzawa 2003). We discussed \nthe developmental data gained in the captive task settings \nregarding the tool-use literature on the wild great apes.\nThis study’s second part assessed the hierarchical com-\nplexity exhibited in the nesting-cup task to examine the \nhighest cognitive capacities achieved by human children \nand adult chimpanzees. We examined the hierarchical struc-\nture building capacities (see Asano 2021, in this volume, \nfor a review of this topic in the evolution of language and \nmusic) by applying the notation system of action grammar \nthat focuses on the combinatory strategies used in sequential \ncup manipulations (Hayashi 2007b). We aimed to contribute \nto language evolution research by investigating the cogni-\ntive capacities required to build highly hierarchical combi-\nnations using multiple objects in human children and adult \nchimpanzees.\n[Study 1] Methods\nSubjects\nThe first study focused on the developmental trajectory \nof human children and great apes in comparative task \n432 Primates (2022) 63:429–441\n1 3\nsettings providing identical objects. The subjects of the \nlongitudinal study were three infant chimpanzees (Pan \ntroglodytes). The chimpanzee infants (one male, Ayumu, \nand two females, Cleo and Pal) were raised by their bio-\nlogical mothers at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto \nUniversity, and examined once in 1–2 weeks from age 0 \nto 4 years.\nThe subjects of the cross-sectional study were two bon-\nobo infants (Pan paniscus), three gorilla infants (Gorilla \ngorilla), and four orangutan infants (Pongo pygmaeus pyg-\nmaeus) (Figs.  1a, b, c, respectively). At the time of testing \nin August 2000, the bonobos and gorillas were housed \nat the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart, Germany, in the nurs-\nery peer group for each species. Furthermore, during the \nAugust 2010 testing, the orangutans were accommodated \nat the Bukit Merah Orang Utan Island, Perak, Malaysia, \nin a nursery peer group. They were hand-reared by human \ncaretakers mainly for health reasons in early infancy and \nwere practically the last generation to be separated from \ntheir conspecific mothers. Table  1 shows detailed informa-\ntion on the great ape subjects.\nSettings\nThe object-manipulation activities were provided to the \nsubjects. Three tasks were selected from nonverbal tasks \nFig. 1  a A bonobo (Limbuko) manipulating a cup-unit. b A gorilla (Iringa) manipulating a block in each hand. c An orangutan (Deepa) stacking \nblocks. d A chimpanzee (Ayumu) participating in the nesting-cup task\nTable 1  Information of the great-ape subjects\ny year, m month\nSpecies Name Date of birth Sex Age at test\nChimpanzee Ayumu 04/24/2000 Male 0–4 y, 20 y\nCleo 06/19/2000 Female 0–4 y, 20 y\nPal 08/09/2000 Female 0–4 y, 20 y\nBonobo Limbuko 10/04/1995 Male 4 y, 9 m\nKuno 11/26/1996 Male 3 y, 8 m\nGorilla Luena 12/25/1996 Female 3 y, 7 m\nKumbuka 11/15/1997 Male 2 y, 8 m\nIringa 01/31/1998 Female 2 y, 6 m\nOrangutan Deepa 11/08/2007 Female 2 y, 9 m\nApril 04/13/2008 Female 2 y, 4 m\nTuah 03/26/2009 Male 1 y, 5 m\nJune Jr 12/01/2008 Female 1 y, 8 m\n433Primates (2022) 63:429–441 \n1 3\nincluded in the Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development \n(KSPD) reported in Ikuzawa (2000): (1) stick insertion, (2) \nnesting cups, and (3) block stacking. As the KSPD tests \nhave been standardized by testing 1562 Japanese children \n(ranging from 1 to 13 years of age), we used the data pro-\nvided in KSPD showing the age of 50 and 75% of human \nchildren pass each task. The chimpanzee infants partici-\npated in similar tasks longitudinally under a face-to-face \nparadigm. Other great apes partook in the task compris-\ning (2) nesting cups and (3) block stacking in a group \nsetting. (1) The stick insertion involved inserting a rod \ninto a hole on a box surface (reported as the “Box” task \nin Hayashi and Matsuzawa 2003). (2) The nesting cups \nwere employed to insert cup(s) with different diameters in \na seriated structure. (3) The block stacking was utilized to \nstack cubic blocks (5 × 5 × 5 cm, while KSPD tests used \ncubic blocks of 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 cm) into a vertical structure. \nSometimes, we mixed cylindrical blocks (5 cm in height \nand 5 cm in diameter) in the provided set of blocks to test \ntheir understanding of physical causality (Hayashi 2007a).\nThe chimpanzee infants were accompanied by the \nmother and tested in a face-to-face setting by a human \nexperimenter at a playroom at the Primate Research Insti-\ntute, Kyoto University. Chimpanzee infants were assessed \nlongitudinally, and their mothers performed object \nmanipulation tasks as models for the infants. Chimpan-\nzees sporadically received food rewards during the face-\nto-face tasks regardless of their performance in object \nmanipulation.\nThe other great apes were tested in a group setting with \ntheir living enclosure with peers during a period of 2–3 \nweeks. The subjects participated only in tasks (2) and (3) \nbecause of limitations regarding time and resources. A \nkeeper or the first author sporadically entered the enclo-\nsures to provide the objects to be manipulated or to model \nmanipulative behaviors. No food rewards were awarded \nduring the observations in the group setting.\nAnalysis\nThe human data used for the analysis of species compari-\nson in Study 1 were mainly based on the larger data set \nfrom the KSPD reported in Ikuzawa (2000). The data set \nfor chimpanzee subjects were based on the longitudinal \nobservations. Moreover, the species comparison in Study \n1 employed cross-sectional data from three species of the \ngreat apes by focusing on the combinatory manipulation \nonset (more general manipulative repertoire of bonobos and \ngorillas was reported by Hayashi and Takeshita (2002) and \nHayashi et al. (2006)).\nResults\nTable  2 summarizes the developmental onset of each \nbehavioral milestone in each species. The human data in \nit are based on the data from the KSPD reported by Iku-\nzawa (2000), except the data on making higher tower with \nlarger cubic blocks and stacking cylindrical blocks which \nwas gained from the subjects of the Study 2. Half of the \nhuman children succeeded in the stick insertion at 1 year \nand 1 month of age. A chimpanzee, Pal, initially succeeded \nit at 8 months of age. Similarly, half of the human chil-\ndren prospered in the insertion to make a three-cup nest-\ning at 1 year and 5 months of age; further, a chimpanzee, \nCleo, first succeeded at 1 year and 5 months of age. Thus, \nthe human children and the chimpanzees demonstrated \na combinatory object manipulation requiring an insert-\ning action from a similar chronological age. Contrast -\ningly, half of the former thrived in stacking smaller cubic \nblocks at 1 year and 1 month of age, while a chimpanzee, \nPal, did so in stacking larger cubic blocks at 2 years and \n7 months of age.

Contrarily, the human children succeeded \nin making a tower of seven blocks of larger size only after \nabout 8 months from their first success (at 1 year and 9 \nmonths of age) with the same cubic blocks (5 × 5 × 5 cm). \nAdditionally, two other infant chimpanzees primarily tri-\numphed in stacking larger cubic blocks at 3 years and 1 \nmonth of age when the training attempts were introduced \nby the human experimenters. After the success in stacking \ncubic blocks, both human children and the chimpanzee \nwho spontaneously piled them succeeded in assembling \ncylindrical blocks from initial phase (reported precisely \nby Hayashi 2007a).\nMoreover, the other three species of the great ape \ninfants showed both types of combinatory object manipu-\nlation, insertion, and stacking in captive settings during \ntheir development. However, the timing and the order of \ndevelopment in the different types of combinatory object \nmanipulations varied among the great apes. The bonobos \ndisplayed patterns of acquisition order similar to those \nof chimpanzees: a younger bonobo subject, Kuno, aged \n3 years and 8 months, successfully inserted a cup into \na larger cup but did not stack up the blocks. The older \nbonobo subject, Limbuko, aged 4 years and 9 months, suc-\ncessfully combined up to three cups into a nesting struc-\nture and succeeded in creating a tower of seven blocks. In \ncontrast, a gorilla aged 3 years and 7 months old, named \nIringa, began block stacking but not cup insertion. Only \nthe oldest gorilla subject, Luena, aged 3 years and 7 \nmonths, succeeded in stacking up five blocks and combin-\ning up to three cups in a nesting structure. An orangutan \naged 2 years and 9 months, Deepa, succeeded in both cup \ninsertion and block stacking.\n[Study 2] Methods\nSubjects\nFor the second study of the nesting-cup manipulation, the \nparticipants of the longitudinal study were 18 human chil-\ndren (eight males and ten females, aged 1 year and 0 months \nto 4 years and 0 months). They were recruited from the Umi-\nkaze Infant Laboratory of the University of Shiga Prefecture \nand tested once in 1- to 3-month intervals. We attempted to \ninclude two participants (one male and one female) from \neach age class in months above 1 year; however, this was \noccasionally difficult with the younger age classes. For the \nchimpanzee subjects, we evaluated the same chimpanzees \nafter 20 years from the onset of Study 1. Additionally, we \ntested other adult chimpanzees (Ai, Chloe, and Pan, the \nmothers of the three infant chimpanzees).\nSettings\nThe human children were accompanied by a parent and \nexamined in a face-to-face setting with the first author \nunder the consent of their parents and approval from the \nUniversity of Shiga Prefecture. The three chimpanzees \nwere continuously tested in the nesting-cup task in a face-\nto-face paradigm with the first author, once a month, after \nthe period covered by Study 1 until they were 9 years old. \nThe average number of cups successfully combined into a \nnesting structure was 4.97, 4.69, and 5.97 for Ayumu, Cleo, \nand Pal, respectively, when they were 6.5–10 years old. For \nthe tests in Study 2, we arranged cups in an experimental \nbooth and allowed a chimpanzee to access and manipulate \nthe objects (Fig. 1d). Both human and chimpanzee subjects \nwere given verbal encouragement for the general manipula-\ntion of objects; however, they were not provided any instruc-\ntions for specific manipulative strategies. The chimpanzee \nparticipants in the nesting-cup task received a food reward \nafter each trial regardless of their performances in complet-\ning the full seriation.\nAnalysis\nThe analysis of the combination strategies in the nesting-\ncup task utilized the data gained from the face-to-face and \nindividual tasks with the human children and the adult \nchimpanzees, respectively. A flow of cup manipulation \nwas coded following the notation system of action gram-\nmar developed by Hayashi (2007b) that describes three key \ncomponents of a manipulative action: object, action, and \nlocation. For instance, 1N2/12N3 is coded when a subject \ninserts the smallest cup into a second cup and subsequently \nadds the two cup-unit into the largest/third cup. The result-\ning coding data were further analyzed using the normal cat-\negorization of combination strategies defined by Greenfield \net al. (1972) for each combinatory action (see Fig.  2 for an \nillustration). Thus, the aforementioned instance was coded \nas “Pairing” (1N2) and “Subassembly” (12N3). Moreover, \nwe added some additional categories to better describe the \nentire manipulative pattern, including piling or disassembly.\nFig. 2  Schematic illustration of three types of combination strategies. \nThe example codes in the right side of the figure show the code for \nthe last manipulative action in each sequence\n435Primates (2022) 63:429–441 \n1 3\nThe human children above 1 year 0 months were divided \ninto the following six age classes: 1 year 0 month–1 year \n5 months (seven participants), 1 year 6 months–1 year \n11 months (ten participants), 2 years 0 months–2 years \n5  months (12 participants), 2  years 6  months–2  years \n11 months (12 participants), 3 years 0 months–3 years \n5 months (12 participants), and 3 years 6 months–4 years \n0 months (14 participants). We selected the last trial in \neach participant that provided the largest number of cups \nto be seriated by them. The coded data in the last trial were \ncategorized into nine manipulative patterns. Greenfield \net al. (1972) defined three patterns of cup combinations: \npairing, pot, and subassembly strategies. Additionally, we \nadded further clarifications to the three classical strategies. \nWe differentiated the target of an inserting action: “Sub-\nassembly” denotes inserting a cup-unit into a larger cup, \nwhile “Unit–Unit” indicates inserting a cup-unit into a \nlarger cup-unit, categorized as the more advanced form of \nthe subassembly strategy. We also differentiated piling, in \nwhich a larger cup was stacked on a smaller one. Since the \npiling combination was relatively rare, we made only two \ncategories: “Pile,” piling a cup on a smaller cup/unit, and \n“Pile Sub,” a cup-unit on a smaller cup/unit. “Put” signi-\nfies the participant combined a cup/unit with another cup/\nunit, however, retrieved it without releasing the manipulating \nhand. “Disassemble” means the participant detached a cup/\nunit from a premade cup-unit. “Other” included any other \nmanipulation of cup/unit such as mouthing, replacing on the \nfloor surface, reversing the orientation of a cup, banging, etc. \nWe calculated the percentage of each manipulative category \ndivided by the total number of manipulative actions recorded \nin the last trial for each participant. We selected ten trials \nfrom the adult chimpanzee subjects, where they were given \nnine or ten cups to be seriated. Because of the limitation \nregarding the number of participants in each age class, we \ndid not conduct any statistical analyses.\nResults\nTable 3 shows the summary of the cup manipulations per -\nformed by human children and adult chimpanzees. The \nlast trial with the largest number of cups provided in a \ntesting session was analyzed for each human participant \nof a tested age. Human children were categorized into six \nage classes. The maximum number of cups provided in \nthe last trial ranged from three to six in the age class start-\ning from 1 year 0 months and reached nine or ten in the \nage class starting from 3 years 6 months. The maximum \nnumber of cups in a successful nesting structure (a smaller \ncup, regardless of its contiguity, is inserted in a larger \ncup) ranged from two to five in the age class starting from \n1 year 0 months and reached nine or ten in the age class \nstarting from 3 years 6 months. The success rate (percent-\nage of trials in which all cups provided were successfully \ncombined in a complete nesting structure) was 14.3% in \nthe age class starting from 1 year 0 months and reached \n100% in the age class starting from 3 years 6 months. \nBased on the notation system of action grammar defined by \nHayashi (2007b), we recorded the manipulation patterns \nfor the human children and the adult chimpanzees. The \ntotal number of manipulations counted in each trial ranged \nfrom 4 (observed in a subject of 1 year and 6 months old \nfor the four given cups) to 140 (observed in a subject of \n2 years and 9 months old for the nine given cups) for the \nhuman children. The average number of manipulations in \na trial gradually increased, peaked at the age class start -\ning from 2 years 6 months (about 61 manipulations were \nrecorded in a trial), and gradually decreased in the older \nchildren. For the adult chimpanzees, the maximum num-\nber of cups was 9–10 and those successfully combined \ninto a nesting structure was 5–10, with a success rate was \n70.0%. The total number of manipulations totaled in each \ntrial ranged from 23 to 192 (observed in Pal and Cleo for \nTable 3  Cup manipulations observed in human children and chimpanzees\nHuman children were categorized into six age classes.

In the former, the most popular combinato-\nrial pattern was pairing (18.8%) for those aged 1 year and \n0 months to 1 year and 5 months of age. The pot strategy \ngradually increased and peaked (20.1%) in human children \nfrom 3 years and 0 months to 3 years and 5 months of age. \nIn the oldest age class of the human children from 3 years \nand 6 months to 4 years and 0 months, the classical subas-\nsembly strategy was observed in 31.9% (24.1% for the single \nrecipient cup and 7.8% for the unit–unit combination). In \nadult chimpanzees, it was observed in 19.7% (11.6% for the \nsingle recipient cups and 8.1% for the unit–unit combina -\ntions). However, there were great individual variations in \nthe use of the subassembly strategy regarding the chimpan-\nzee subjects: Cleo showed none of the 192 manipulations, \nPal displayed 11 subassembly strategies (nine for the single \nrecipient cup and two for unit–unit combination) out of the \n23 manipulations scoring the highest (47.8%) for the subas-\nsembly strategy (details are shown in Supplementary Table).\nGeneral discussion\nDevelopment of combinatory object manipulation \nin great apes\nCombinatory object manipulation is a precursor of tool-\nusing behaviors and a good indicator of cognitive develop-\nment in primates, including humans. In Study 1, we con -\nducted a cross-species comparison to accumulate additional \ndata on the developmental pathway of combinatory object \nmanipulation in the great apes. The tool-using behaviors in \nthe wild great apes other than the chimpanzees are relatively \ninfrequent compared to the wild chimpanzees; however, \nall great ape species examined in this study under captive \nsettings readily showed two forms of combinatory object \nmanipulation, insertion and stacking, during their infancy. \nThus, they may share fundamental physical and cogni-\ntive abilities to enable the emergence of tool use in their \nwild habitats. Furthermore, a comparison among the great \napes revealed that the insertion action in the chimpanzees \ndevelops at a time comparable to that of humans. The early \nacquisition of inserting action in the chimpanzees may \nalso explain the tool-use commonality reported in the wild \nchimpanzees.\nThe action patterns involved in combinatory object \nmanipulations may explain the differences observed between \nthe results of humans and great apes. Human children started \nto exhibit two kinds of combinatory object manipulation, \ninsertion, and stacking, at around the same age when they \npassed 1 year of age. Although chimpanzees started to dem-\nonstrate an inserting action from a comparable age with \nhuman children, the first acquisition of stacking action was \ndelayed in the chimpanzees, as compared to the humans. A \nsimilar order of development was observed for the bonobos. \nIn contrast, the gorillas started to display stacking actions \nat an earlier age. The orangutans exhibited both types of \ncombinatory object manipulations simultaneously. Torigoe’s \nstudy (1985) reported action patterns used in object manipu-\nlation among 74 species of non-human primates by provid-\ning a rope and a wooden cube to be manipulated freely in \ntheir cages. However, it mainly focused on more general \naction repertoire and excluded the precise analysis on combi-\nnatory object manipulation among the great apes. Moreover, \nthe described patterns of combinatory object manipulation \nwere mainly targeted to an environmental substrate (such \nas a wire mesh of the cage or water surface) and not to a \ndetached object, which was the present study’s focus. We \nneed additional developmental data from a greater num -\nber of the great ape subjects under the setting of providing \nthem with more detached objects to provoke combinatory \nmanipulations.\nAnother important point for the observed order of the \naction patterns involved in combinatory object manipula-\ntion was the early acquisition of the inserting action in the \nmanipulative development of captive chimpanzees. Among \nthe long list of tool-use repertoire of the wild chimpanzees \nreported, the tool-using behaviors that include the insert-\ning action are commonly observed in almost all chimpanzee \ncommunities across Africa (Whiten et al. 1999), except for \na community in Budongo, Uganda. Despite efforts to find \nand solicit the use of stick tools even under experimental set-\ntings, the Budongo chimpanzees have never been reported to \nemploy stick tools (Gruber et al. 2011; Mugisha et al. 2016) \nthat have been commonly reported in other chimpanzee \nFig. 3  Proportion of the manipulative actions during nesting-cup task \nin human children of six age classes and adult chimpanzees\n437Primates (2022) 63:429–441 \n1 3\ncommunities (Whiten et al. 2001). There might be some eco-\nlogical or social/cultural factors that explain the absence of \nstick tool use in Budongo (Gruber et al. 2012; Lamon et al. \n2018); nevertheless, even in the Budongo community, the \nchimpanzees use leaf tools with an inserting action (Gruber \net al. 2016). Thus, this inserting action may be universal in \nthe behavioral repertoire of chimpanzees supported by the \necological validity to survive in the wild with the assistance \nof inserting tools. This may explain the early acquisition of \nthe insertion action even in captivity. However, the great ape \nspecies compared in this study revealed that the acquisition \nof inserting action in chimpanzees was early and the timing \nwas comparable to that of human infants instead of other \ngreat apes.\nPatterns of object combinations and implications \nfor tool‑using behaviors in the wild great apes\nAlthough the great apes possess the fundamental cogni-\ntive ability to perform combinatory object manipulation in \ncaptivity, some other factors may contribute to the tool-use \nfrequency and variety in the wild. Furuichi et al. (2015) \ncompared the tool-use repertoire in wild chimpanzees and \nbonobos and showed that the latter rarely use tools for \nfeeding, while the former do. They also pointed out that \nthe paucity of tool use in wild bonobos was not explained \nby the current ecological or social factors; however, they \nsuggested the possible influence of past historical circum-\nstances. Koops et al. (2015) reported that wild chimpanzees \nengaged more in object manipulation and play than bonobos \nof the same age range of zero to eight years, consistent with \na species difference in the intrinsic motivation for tool use. \nHowever, in captive settings, both chimpanzees and bonobos \nhave shown equally diverse and highly complex tool-use \nrepertoires in most contexts (Gruber et al. 2010). Similarly, \nthe tool-use repertoires in gorillas (Breuer et al. 2005) and \norangutans (Meulman and van Schaik 2013; van Schaik \net al. 2003) in the wild have been relatively smaller than \nthose in chimpanzees (Sanz and Morgan 2007). Neverthe-\nless, the rehabilitated and captive orangutans have demon-\nstrated various tool-using behaviors, including complex imi-\ntative actions (Russon and Galdikas 1993; Damerius et al. \n2019). Some previous studies have proposed hypotheses to \nexplain the species differences found regarding tool-using \nbehavior (Byrne 2004; van Schaik et al. 1999). Our study \nshowed that the captive great apes readily acquire combi-\nnatory object manipulation during their infancy; moreover, \nthey may share the common cognitive abilities that enable \nthe emergence of tool-using behaviors under certain condi-\ntions in wild settings.\nIt should be noted that there were species differences \nin the order of development between the two types of \ncombinatory object manipulation. Previous developmental \nstudies have illuminated it with respect to performing nut \ncracking behavior. The chimpanzees in Bossou started to \nput a nut on an anvil stone and hit something with a ham-\nmerstone at the same age of one and a half years (Inoue-\nNakamura and Matsuzawa 1997). Contrastingly, the tufted \ncapuchin monkeys in the Tietê Ecological Park, Brazil, \nbegan smashing an object against a substrate (first level \nof combinatory object manipulation) from as early as age \nfive months; however, placing a nut on a surface appeared \nconsiderably later, at Age Block 4, ranging from one and a \nhalf to two years of age (Resende et al. 2008). Thus, even \nif the final behavioral outcome is identical, ontogeny may \nvary among different species. Although we had limited \nnumber of subjects at certain age points, our study sug-\ngested that each great ape species may exhibit specific \npatterns in the developmental order of different types of \ncombinatory object manipulations. Specifically, gorillas \nshowed the opposite order of development from chim-\npanzees and bonobos, an earlier appearance of stacking \nblocks as compared to inserting cups. This may reflect the \nspecies-specific patterns of manipulative tendency, as wild \ngorillas are known to have relatively limited tool-using \nrepertoires; however, they indicate highly sophisticated \nbimanual coordination and digit role differentiation in \nprocessing foods (Byrne et al. 2001). Another possibil-\nity is that the objects used in the present study may have \nprovided diverse affordances for different species of the \ngreat apes. Human infants develop tool-using behaviors \nthrough exploratory manipulation by detecting and relat-\ning affordances between objects (Lockman 2000 ). For \nchimpanzees and bonobos, the affordances of cups might \nbe more salient and trigger manipulative actions, includ-\ning inserting action to make a unit of multiple cups. The \nyounger bonobo subjects demonstrated additionally varied \nmanipulation of cups (Hayashi and Takeshita 2002) and \nprepared cup combinations and transported them as units \nto other locations. For gorillas, the affordances of blocks \nmay be more prominent and activate various manipulative \nactions, including stacking blocks into a tower structure. \nWe should accumulate more empirical data through lon-\ngitudinal studies focusing on comparative cognitive devel -\nopment among primates (Biro et al. 2006; Meulman et al. \n2013; Rosati et al. 2014) both in captivity and in the wild. \nHowever, we should avoid testing infants of great apes \nwho were separated from their conspecific mothers and \npeers to foster the development of species-specific behav -\niors (Hayashi and Matsuzawa 2017). Similar to the situa-\ntion in the wild, we were able to observe the development \nof infants’ manipulative skills in group settings including \nthe mothers by considering the effect of social learning.\n438 Primates (2022) 63:429–441\n1 3\nHierarchical combinations of nesting cups in adult \nchimpanzees and human children\nIn Study 2, we demonstrated the clear advantage of explicit \nexperimental settings with positive reinforcement for assess-\ning the maximum performance in making hierarchical object \ncombinations. The process of crafting highly hierarchical \ncombinations can be regarded as “action grammar,” which \nmay be linked to the cognitive underpinnings of human lin-\nguistic abilities. The wild chimpanzees in Bossou, Guinea, \nselect and reuse effective tool composites and certain func-\ntional units of stone tools (Carvalho et al. 2009). The maxi-\nmum number of objects assembled in a tool composite was \nfour that was observed during nut cracking by the Bossou \nchimpanzees; two wedge stones under an anvil, and a ham-\nmerstone (Carvalho et al. 2008). Contrastingly, the captive \nadult chimpanzees succeeded in combining up to 10 cups \ninto a nesting structure. The clear sensorimotor feedback \nof the success/failure of an inserting action may facilitate \nthe creation of various combinations of cups with trial-\nand-error strategies. Moreover, the combined cups can be \neasily handled as a unit, which is in clear contrast to stone \nor block composites. Providing these objects designed to \nsolicit more complex and hierarchical combinations as a set \nin an individual experimental setting may lead the chimpan-\nzees to concentrate on cup manipulation and elaborate the \ncup combinations. Both chimpanzees and human children \nwere offered social encouragement to manipulate the cups \nas well as social praise at the end of each trial (moreover, a \nfood reward for chimpanzee subjects). Although the social \nencouragement did not seem to enhance the specific manipu-\nlative strategy, it may prolong the time of cup manipula-\ntions in general, providing more chances for achieving the \nfinal goal through repetitive trial-and-error strategies. Col-\nlectively, the nesting-cup tasks increased the probability of \nachieving an additionally complex hierarchical structure by \na sequential combinatory manipulation.\nThe evolutionary comparison of complexity in animal and \nearly human tool use showed that the highly hierarchical tool \nuse and the manufacture enabled by the working-memory \ncapacity characterizes the intelligence observed only in early \nhumans (Haidle 2010). The increased complexity of stone \ntool-making technology observed in the human lineage has \nalso been assessed (Stout 2011) and further discussed in line \nwith the technological pedagogy hypothesis, which led to \nthe emergence of intentional vocal communication among \nhumans (Stout and Chaminade 2012). However, more focus \nshould be given to the sequence of actions employed to \nmake complex tools that can be analyzed as action gram -\nmar (Pastra and Aloimonos 2012; Stout et al. 2018). Hansell \nand Ruxton (2008) claimed that tool utilization (originally \ndefined as using a detached object) should be examined \nwithin the wider context of construction behaviors (such as \nnest building) observed in a wider range of animals. Con-\nstruction behaviors usually require multiple steps during \nthe building phase, however, they are all categorized into \nthe “pot strategy,” sequentially adding the subsequent ele-\nment without a role reversal. The role reversal or recursion \nin linguistics can only be realized by manipulating multiple \ndetached objects as a unit in the sequence of combinatory \nobject manipulation in the form of a “subassembly strat-\negy” (Fujita 2009, 2017). Five out of six adult chimpanzees \ntested in the current nesting-cup task readily employed the \nsubassembly strategy that may require some level of cogni-\ntive capacity to manipulate a unit of multiple objects. Older \nhuman children above three years old also employed the \nsubassembly strategy, and the success rates were increased \nin the same age classes. Moreover, those human children \nand adult chimpanzees, who demonstrated the subassem-\nbly strategy, also combined a unit of cups with another \nunit (unit–unit combination) that may be more cognitively \ndemanding to divide attention into two equal parts (referred \nto as “multiple attention” in Fujita and Fujita’s study (2021). \nHowever, it should be noted that not only the human children \naged above 3 years but also those aged below it showed \na subassembly strategy during the manipulative sequence. \nThe adult chimpanzees who participated in this study had \nprior experiences in various types of cognitive experiments, \nincluding object-manipulation tasks. Not only a chimpan-\nzee named Ai, who had received artificial-language training, \nbut also other chimpanzees reported subassembly strategies \n(referred to as “Action-Merge” by Fujita and Fujita (2021)) \nif they were requested to combine cups to construct a hier -\narchical structure.\nStudy 2 of the present study showed that adult chimpan-\nzees experiencing a complex problem-solving task of nesting \ncups readily made highly complex hierarchical combinations \namong cups and moved the combined cups as a unit to be \nfurther merged with another one. The object manipulation \nmay have worked as an external enhancer to achieve a hier-\narchical complexity in cognition and behavior in both human \nchildren and adult chimpanzees. Both species showed simi-\nlar patterns of adjusting the cup combinations through trial \nand error; however, they also used the subassembly strategy \nthat was suggested to be linked to a human language (Green-\nfield 1991). The manipulation of objects can be regarded \nas the externalization of internal/cognitive processing; its \nresult becomes visible as the change in the environment. \nThus, compared to the completely internal processing of \nthe human linguistic structure, the hierarchical structure-\nbuilding during object manipulation may be more advanced \nand widely confirmed from the early stages of development \nand evolution of human beings. We need to further investi-\ngate the sequential order of each manipulative action exhib-\nited in the nesting-cup task to emphasize species-specific \nand age-related changes in the patterns of action grammar. \n439Primates (2022) 63:429–441 \n1 3\nOur study suggests that chimpanzees may share cognitive \nunderpinnings for creating hierarchical combinations among \nmultiple objects through sequential manipulative actions. \nWe need to clarify which cognitive functions play a key role \nin accelerating the evolution of human language by applying \ncomparable tasks in different species of Hominidae.\nConclusions\nWe found that great-ape infants readily develop cognitive \ncapacities that enable the emergence of combinatory object \nmanipulations, which may be regarded as action merge. \nGreat apes, especially chimpanzees, utilize tools in their \nwild habitat based on this fundamental ability of combining \nobjects. Study 1 showed that the developmental order of \nthe two types of combinatory object manipulation, insertion \nand stacking, were different among the great apes; however, \nwe need more longitudinal developmental studies to ascer -\ntain the precise timing of acquisition in species other than \nchimpanzees.\nIn Study 2, we found that both human children and adult \nchimpanzees could combine nesting-cups to make a highly \nhierarchical structure. However, according to the individual \naction-based analysis grounded upon the notation system \nof action grammar developed by Hayashi (2007b), human \nchildren and adult chimpanzees demonstrated not only \ncombinatory object manipulations but also disassembling \nmanipulations on the previously made combinations of cups, \nindicating the use of the trial-and-error strategy. By applying \nthe subassembly strategy, human and chimpanzee subjects \nmay try to improve the cup combinations more efficiently.\nTaken together, object-manipulation tasks are useful for \ncomparing human and nonhuman primates in comparable \ntask-settings and may solicit highly complex combinatory \nmanipulations as objects works as an external enhancer. \nComparative studies on the development of combinatory \nobject manipulation and material intelligence in primates \nmay shed further light on the cognitive capabilities which \nenabled the evolution of human language.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10329- 022- 01003-2.\nAcknowledgements The study and the preparation of manuscript was \nfinancially supported by the following grants, Japan Society for the Pro-\nmotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI nos. 15K00204 to MH, 16203034 \nto HT, 19K21824 to Michiru Makuuchi, 15H05709 to Masaki Tomon-\naga, 16H06283 and Core-to-Core Program A.
