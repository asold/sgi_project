  "abstract": "Background Transformer-based language models have shown great potential to revolutionize health care by advancing clinical decision support, patient interaction, and disease prediction. However, despite their rapid development, the implementation of transformer-based language models in health care settings remains limited. This is partly due to the lack of a comprehensive review, which hinders a systematic understanding of their applications and limitations. Without clear guidelines and consolidated information, both researchers and physicians face difficulties in using these models effectively, resulting in inefficient research efforts and slow integration into clinical workflows. Objective This scoping review addresses this gap by examining studies on medical transformer-based language models and categorizing them into 6 tasks: dialogue generation, question answering, summarization, text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. Methods We conducted a scoping review following the Cochrane scoping review protocol. A comprehensive literature search was performed across databases, including Google Scholar and PubMed, covering publications from January 2017 to September 2024. Studies involving transformer-derived models in medical tasks were included. Data were categorized into 6 key tasks. Results Our key findings revealed both advancements and critical challenges in applying transformer-based models to health care tasks. For example, models like MedPIR involving dialogue generation show promise but face privacy and ethical concerns, while question-answering models like BioBERT improve accuracy but struggle with the complexity of medical terminology. The BioBERTSum summarization model aids clinicians by condensing medical texts but needs better handling of long sequences. Conclusions This review attempted to provide a consolidated understanding of the role of transformer-based language models in health care and to guide future research directions. By addressing current challenges and exploring the potential for real-world applications, we envision significant improvements in health care informatics. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing proposed solutions can enable transformer-based language models to significantly improve health care delivery and patient outcomes. Our review provides valuable insights for future research and practical applications, setting the stage for transformative advancements in medical informatics.",
