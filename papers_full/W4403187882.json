    "abstract": "The flight arrival scheduling problem is one of the critical tasks in air traffic operations, aiming to ensure that the flight arrive in the correct sequence safely. Existing methods primarily focus on the terminal area and often overlook the presence of training flight at the airport. Due to the limited generalization of traditional methods and varying control practices at different airports, training flight at airports still rely on manual control for arrival sorting. To effectively address these issues, we propose a novel method for slot allocation that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and generalization potential of large language models (LLMs). Our method conceptualizes the dynamic scheduling problem for training flight as a language modeling problem, a perspective not previously explored. Specifically, we represent the allocator’s inputs and outputs as language tokens, utilizing LLMs to generate conflict-free results based on a language description of requested landing information and assigned training flight information. Additionally, we employ a reset strategy to create a small dataset for scenario-specific samples, enabling LLMs to quickly learn allocation schemes from the dataset. We demonstrated the capability of LLMs in addressing time conflicts by evaluating metrics such as answer accuracy, conflict rate, and total delay time (without the wrong answer). These findings underscore the feasibility of employing LLMs in the field of air traffic control.",
