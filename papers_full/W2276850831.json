    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new methodology aimed at retrieving relevant product aspects from a collection of customer reviews, as well as the most salient sentiments expressed about them. Our proposal is both unsupervised and domain independent, and does not relies on NLP techniques such as parsing or dependence analysis. In our experiments, the proposed method achieves good values of precision. It is also shown that our approach is capable of properly retrieving the relevant aspects and their sentiments even from individual reviews.",
