However, ﬁne-\ntuned LMs may exhibit biases against certain pro-\ntected groups (e.g., gender and ethnic minorities),\n1Code and data: https://github.com/INK-U\nSC/Upstream-Bias-Mitigation\n2The work was partially done when Xisen Jin was an intern\nat Snap Inc.\n(a) Classifier bias mitigation(b) Representational bias mitigation\nModel\n(c) Removing sensitive attributes from data\nDe-bias\nDataset\nDataset.man.woman.doctor\nDe-bias\nModel\nModel…De-bias Upstream Model Model\nDataset 𝒟!\"\nDataset𝒟!#\n(d) Upstream bias mitigation for fine-tuning\nDataset\nDatarepresentations…Frozen Model\nFine-tuning\nDatasets 𝒟$\",𝒟$#…\nDe-bias\nModel\nFigure 1: Comparison between the focus of our\nstudy (d) and previous works (a,b,c). We study the\nviability of obtaining an upstream model that could re-\nduce bias in a number of downstream classiﬁers when\nﬁne-tuned.\nas models may learn to associate certain features\nwith positive or negative labels spuriously (Dixon\net al., 2018), or propagate bias encoded in PTLMs\nto downstream classiﬁers (Caliskan et al., 2017;\nBolukbasi et al., 2016). Among many exam-\nples, Kurita et al. (2019) demonstrates gender-bias\nin the pronoun resolution task when models are\ntrained using BERT embeddings, and Kennedy\net al. (2020) shows that hate speech classiﬁers ﬁne-\ntuned from BERT result in more frequent false pos-\nitive predictions for certain group identiﬁer men-\ntions (e.g., “muslim”, “black”).\nApproaches for bias mitigation are mostly ap-\nplied during ﬁne-tuning to reduce bias in a spe-\nciﬁc downstream task or dataset (Park et al., 2018;\nZhang et al., 2018; Beutel et al., 2017) (see Fig. 1\n(a)). For example, data augmentation approaches\nreduce the inﬂuence of spurious features in the\noriginal dataset (Dixon et al., 2018; Zhao et al.,\n2018; Park et al., 2018), and adversarial learn-\ning approaches generate debiased data represen-\ntations that are exclusive to the downstream model\n(Kumar et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). These\ntechniques act on biases particular to the given\ndataset, domain, or task, and require new bias miti-\ngation when switching to a new downstream task\nor dataset. This can require auxiliary training ob-\njectives, the deﬁnition of task-speciﬁc fairness met-\narXiv:2010.12864v2  [cs.CL]  11 Apr 2021\nrics, the annotation of bias attributes (e.g., identi-\nfying African American Vernacular English), and\nthe collection of users’ demographic data. These\ndrawbacks make bias mitigation inaccessible to\nthe growing community, ﬁne-tuning LMs to new\ndatasets and tasks.\nIn contrast, we investigate initially mitigating\nbias while ﬁne-tuning an “upstream” model in\none or more upstream datasets, and subsequently\nachieving reduced bias when ﬁne-tuning for down-\nstream applications (Fig. 1 (d)), so that bias miti-\ngation is no longer required in downstream train-\ning. Similar to transfer learning for enhancing pre-\ndictive performance in common setups (Pan and\nYang, 2010; Dai and Le, 2015), we suggest that\nLMs that undergo bias mitigation acquire induc-\ntive bias that is helpful for reducing harmful biases\nwhen ﬁne-tuned on new domains and tasks. In four\ntasks with known bias factors — hate speech de-\ntection, toxicity detection, occupation prediction\nfrom short bios, and coreference resolution — we\nexplore whether upstream bias mitigation of a LM\nfollowed by downstream ﬁne-tuning reduces bias\nfor the downstream model. Though previous work\nhas addressed biases in frozen PTLM or word em-\nbeddings (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019;\nBhardwaj et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Ravfogel\net al., 2020), for example by measuring associa-\ntions between gender and occupations in an em-\nbedding space, they do not study their effect on\ndownstream classiﬁers (Fig. 1 (b)), while some of\nthem study the effects while keeping the embed-\ndings frozen (Zhao et al., 2019; Kurita et al., 2019;\nProst et al., 2019). Bias in these frozen represen-\ntations can also be directly corrected by remov-\ning associations between feature and sensitive at-\ntributes (Elazar and Goldberg, 2018; Madras et al.,\n2018) (Fig. 1 (c)), but this does not allow predic-\ntions to be generated for new data.\nOur experiments address the following research\nquestions: (a) whether mitigating a single bias fac-\ntor in the upstream stage is maintained when ﬁne-\ntuning on new examples from the same domain\nand task, (b) whether transfer is viable when the\ndownstream domains and tasks are different from\nthe upstream model, and (c) whether we can ad-\ndress multiple kinds of bias with a single upstream\nmodel. We perform these experiments under a\ngeneric transfer learning framework, noted as Up-\nstream Bias Mitigation (UBM) for Downstream\nFine-Tuning for convenience, which consists of\ntwo stages: ﬁrst, in the upstream bias mitigation\nstage, a LM is ﬁne-tuned with bias mitigation objec-\ntives on one or several “upstream” tasks, and sub-\nsequently the classiﬁcation layer is re-initialized;\nthen, in the downstream ﬁne-tuning stage the en-\ncoder from the upstream model, jointly with the\nnew classiﬁcation layer, are again ﬁne-tuned on\na downstream task without additional bias miti-\ngation steps. Using six datasets with previously\nrecognized bias factors, our analysis show overall\npositive results for the questions above; still, there\nare challenges remaining to stabilize the results\nof bias mitigation in challenging setups, e.g., the\nmulti-bias factor setting.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows: (1)\nwe propose a new research direction for mitigating\nbias in ﬁne-tuned models; (2) we perform extensive\nexperiments to study the viability of the upstream\nbias mitigation framework in various settings; (3)\nwe demonstrate the effectiveness of this research\ndirection, motivating further improvements, tests,\nand applications.\n2 Exploring the Transferability of Bias\nMitigation Effects\nWe consider biases against protected groups in clas-\nsiﬁers ﬁned-tuned from LMs. In our present analy-\nsis, bias is deﬁned as disparate model performance\non different subsets of data which are associated\nwith different demographic groups (e.g., instances\nthat mention or are generated by different social\ngroups) (Blodgett et al., 2020). Our evaluation of\nbias aligns with the deﬁnition of equalized odds\nand equal opportunities (Hardt et al., 2016) in pre-\nvious works of fairness in machine learning.\nHere, we ﬁrst outline our experimental setup\nfor exploring the transferability of bias mitigation\neffects, in which we detail the process of apply-\ning UBM and pose three key research questions\n(section 2.1). We follow by introducing the bias\nfactors studied and the corresponding classiﬁcation\ntasks and datasets (section 2.2), and our evaluation\nprotocols and metrics (section 2.3).\n2.1 Experiment Setups of UBM\nOur goal is to evaluate the transferability of bias\nmitigation effects for one or multiple bias factors in\ndownstream ﬁne-tuned models. We follow an Up-\nstream Bias Mitigation (UBM) for Downstream\nFine-Tuning procedure, pictured in Figure 2.

𝒟\"\n𝑓\"=ℎ\"∘𝑔\"\nFigure 2: Experiment setups to study Upstream Bias Mitigation (UBM) for Downstream Fine-Tuning . We\nconsider the settings with the same or different upstream and downstream domains and tasks, while addressing one\nor more bias factors (e.g., both dialect bias and gender bias). The framework consists of two stages: (1) an upstream\n(source) model fs = hs ◦gs is trained with bias mitigation algorithms and (2) the encoder gs is transferred to the\ndownstream (target) model ft for ﬁne-tuning.\n(source) model fs = hs ◦gs, composed of a text\nencoder gs and a classiﬁer head hs, is trained on\none or more upstream datasets Ds with bias mitiga-\ntion algorithms. The encoder gs is to be transferred\nto downstream (target) domains and tasks while\nthe classiﬁer head hs is discarded. Then, in the\nDownstream Fine-Tuning phase, the downstream\nmodel ft = ht ◦gt utilizes gs to initialize the en-\ncoder weights and is ﬁne-tuned for prediction per-\nformance without bias mitigation approaches on\ndownstream datasets Dt.\nThis UBM process is applied in three settings,\nsummarized below, which each contribute to evalu-\nating the transferability of bias mitigation effects.\n1. Fine-Tuning on the Same Distribution. In\nthe simplest setting, we ﬁne-tune the downstream\nmodel over new examples from the same data dis-\ntribution as the upstream model. In practice, each\ndataset is split into two halves, with one used for\nupstream bias mitigation and the other for down-\nstream ﬁne-tuning.\n2. Cross-Domain and Cross-Task Fine-Tuning.\nSimilar to how LMs are ﬁne-tuned for various tasks\nand domains, in a more practical setup, we test\nwhether transfer of bias mitigation effects is viable\nacross domains and tasks. To achieve this, we\napply bias mitigation while ﬁne-tuning a LM on\none dataset and perform ﬁne-tuning on another.\n3. Multiple Bias Factors. In the most challenging\nsetup, we train a single upstream model to address\nmultiple bias factors ( e.g., both dialect bias and\ngender bias). Such upstream models can be trained\nwith multi-task learning (i.e., jointly training over\nmultiple datasets with shared encoder gbut differ-\nent classiﬁer heads h) while mitigating multiple\nkinds of bias. Subsequently, the resulting upstream\nmodel is transferred to downstream models as be-\nDataset Prediction Task Bias\nGHC (Kennedy et al., 2018) Hate Group IdentiﬁerStormfront (de Gibert et al., 2018) Hate Group IdentiﬁerDWMW (Davidson et al., 2017) Toxicity AA VE DialectFDCL (Founta et al., 2018) Toxicity AA VE DialectBiasBios (De-Arteaga et al., 2019) Occupation Gender StereotypingOntoNotes 5.0 (Weischedel et al., 2013) Coreference Gender Stereotyping\nTable 1: Summary of tasks and bias included for study.\nfore. This is a key test of UBM’s viability for\nwidespread application.\n2.2 Bias Factors and Datasets\nTo ensure our analysis holds true for a variety of\ndomains, tasks, and bias factors, we experiment\nwith three different bias factors studied in previ-\nous research along with six different datasets (also\nsummarized in Table 1), described below.\nGroup Identiﬁer Bias. This bias refers to higher\nfalse positive rates of hate speech predictions\nfor sentences containing speciﬁc group identiﬁers,\nwhich is harmful to protected groups by misclassi-\nfying innocuous text (e.g., “I am a Muslim”) as hate\nspeech. We include two datasets for study, namely\nthe Gab Hate Corpus (GHC; Kennedy et al., 2018)\nand the Stormfront corpus (de Gibert et al., 2018).\nBoth datasets contain binary labels for hate and\nnon-hate instances, though with differences in the\nlabeling schemas and domains.\nAA VE Dialect Bias.Sap et al. (2019) show that\noffensive and hate speech classiﬁers yield a higher\nfalse positive rate on text written in African Ameri-\ncan Vernacular English (AA VE). This bias brings\nsigniﬁcant harm to the communities that uses\nAA VE, for example, by leading to the dispropor-\ntionate removal of the text written in AA VE in\nsocial media platforms (Blodgett et al., 2020). We\ninclude two datasets for study: FDCL (Founta et al.,\n2018) and DWMW (Davidson et al., 2017). In both\ndatasets, we treat abusive, hateful and spam to-\ngether as harmful outcomes (i.e., false positives for\neach are harmful) to compute false positive rates.\nFollowing Sap et al. (2019), we use an off-the-shelf\nAA VE dialect predictor (Blodgett et al., 2016) to\nidentify examples written in AA VE.\nGender Stereotypical Bias. Zhao et al. (2018)\nsummarize a list of occupations that are prone to\nbe stereotyped in practice, leading to coreference\nresolutions models and occupation prediction mod-\nels having biases in performance in pro- and anti-\nstereotypical instances when trained on short bios.\nWe train the coreference resolution model on the\nOntoNotes 5.0 dataset (Weischedel et al., 2013)\nand the occupation classiﬁer on the BiasBios (De-\nArteaga et al., 2019) dataset.\n2.3 Evaluation Protocol and Metrics\nWe evaluate the overall performance of the mod-\nels on downstream tasks along with appropriate\nbias metrics for each bias factor, analyzed for\neach dataset and task in previous works. We ex-\npect UBM to minimally affect classiﬁcation perfor-\nmance while improving on bias metrics.\nClassiﬁcation Performance. We report in-domain\nF1 scores for GHC, Stormfront, OntoNotes 5.0, and\naccuracy scores for FDCL, DWMW and BiasBios.\nFollowing Zhang et al. (2018), for hate speech de-\ntection and toxicity detection datasets, we use the\nequal error rate (EER) threshold for prediction.\nGroup Identiﬁer Bias Metrics. To evaluate group\nidentiﬁer bias, we evaluate false positive rate (FPR)\ndifferences, noted as FPRD, between examples\nmentioning one of 25 group identiﬁers provided\nby Kennedy et al. (2020) and the overall FPR. In\naddition, we followed Kennedy et al. (2020) in us-\ning a New York Times articles (NYT) corpus of\n25k non-hate sentences, each mentioning one of\n25 group identiﬁers. This corpus speciﬁcally pro-\nvides an opportunity to measure FPR—reported as\n(NYT Acc.), equivalent to 1−FPR. Additionally,\nfollowing the evaluation protocol of Dixon et al.\n(2018) and Zhang et al. (2020), we incorporate the\nIdentity Phrase Templates Test Sets (reported as\nIPTTS), which consists of 77khate and non-hate\nexamples mentioning group identiﬁers, generated\nwith templates. Following these works, for IPTTS\nwe compute FPRD as ∑\nz|FPRz −FPRoverall|,\nwhere FPRz is false positive rate on sentences with\nthe group identiﬁer z, and FPRoverall is the overall\nfalse positive rate.\nAA VE Dialect Bias Metrics. Given the sparsity\nof AA VE examples in the datasets and the noisy\noutputs of AA VE classiﬁer (Blodgett et al., 2016),\nwe expect the in-domain FPRD metrics to be noisy.\nTherefore, following Xia et al. (2020), we incor-\nporate the BROD (Blodgett et al., 2016) dataset,\nwhich is a large unlabeled collection of Twitter\nposts written in l. Since in practice only a small\nportion of texts are toxic or spam, we treat all exam-\nples from BROD asnormal, and report the accuracy\n(which equals 1−FPR) on the dataset.\nGender Stereotype Metrics. We employ the\nWinoBias (Zhao et al., 2018) dataset which pro-\nvides opportunities to evaluate models on pro-\nstereotypical and anti-stereotypical coreference ex-\namples. We report the differences in F1 (F1-Diff)\non two subsets of data. On occupation prediction,\nfollowing Ravfogel et al. (2020), we report mean\ndifferences of true positive rate (TPR) differences\nin predicting each occupation for men and women.\n3 Method\nHere, we detail the particular bias mitigation algo-\nrithms used for implementing UBM, as well as the\nother baselines used for verifying the transferability\nof bias mitigation effects.\n3.1 Implementations of UBM\nWe implement UBM with two different bias miti-\ngation algorithms in the upstream bias mitigation\nphase: explanation regularization (Kennedy et al.,\n2020), and adversarial de-biasing (Zhang et al.,\n2018; Madras et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2020), de-\nnoted here as UBMreg and UBMadv, respectively.\nUBM with Explanation Regularization. Expla-\nnation regularization reduces importance placed on\nspurious surface patterns ( i.e., words or phrases)\nduring upstream model training. We apply UBMreg\nto group identiﬁer and AA VE dialect bias, where\nthe set of spurious patterns are group identiﬁers\nand the most frequent words, from statistics of the\ndataset, used by AA VE speakers; we ﬁnd expla-\nnation regularization not effective for gender bias.\nThe importance of a surface pattern w∈W in the\ninput x, noted as φ(w,x) is measured as the model\nprediction change when it is removed. The model\nis trained by optimizing the main learning objective\nℓwhile penalizing importance attributed to patterns\nw∈W that exist in the input x.\nmin\nf\nℓc + α\n∑\nw∈x∩W\n||φ(w,x)||2, (1)\nwhere αis a trade-off hyperparameter.\nUBM with Adversarial De-biasing. In UBMadv,\nthe upstream model is trained with adversarial de-\nbiasing techniques, so that sensitive attributes re-\nlated to bias ( e.g., the dialect of the sentence or\nthe gender referenced in the sentence) cannot be\npredicted from the hidden representations z given\nby the encoder g. During training, an adversar-\nial classiﬁer head hadv is built upon the encoder\nand trained to predict sensitive attributes, while\nthe encoder is optimized to prevent the adversarial\nclassiﬁer from success. Formally, the optimization\nobjective is written as,\nmin\ng,h\nmax\nhadv\nℓc + ℓadv(hadv ◦g(x),a), (2)\nwhere anotes the ground truth sensitive attribute,\nand ℓadv is the cross entropy loss between the pre-\ndicted sensitive attribute and the ground truth sen-\nsitive attribute.\nAs mentioned in Sec. 2.1, upstream models\ncan be trained to mitigate multiple bias factors\nwith multi-task learning on multiple datasets. We\nseparately apply bias mitigation algorithms for\neach dataset (sharing the same encoder) and\nnote the algorithms applied in the subscript ( e.g.,\nUBMreg+adv).\n3.2 Other Baselines\nWe compare UBM with two families of methods.\nMethods without Bias Mitigation. Two types of\nmodels were evaluated that did not address bias.\nFirst, the Vanilla model is a downstream classiﬁer\ndirectly ﬁne-tuned on downstream task from a LM\n(e.g., RoBERTa). Second, Van-Transfer is ﬁne-\ntuned on upstream datasets without bias mitigation\nand ﬁne-tuned on downstream datasets.\nDownstream Bias Mitigation. For reference, we\nshow the results of directly applying explanation\nregularization, noted as Expl. Reg., or adversarial\nde-biasing, noted as Adv. Learning, during down-\nstream ﬁne-tuning. In most cases, mitigating bias\nin downstream classiﬁer should be the most effec-\ntive way to reduce bias, though this is not always\nfeasible in practice for reasons discussed above.\nWe also consider two simple baselines that could\nreduce bias in downstream models via heuristics.\nEmb. Zero zeros out the word embedding of spu-\nrious surface patterns (using the same word list as\nexplanation regularization) in PTLMs before ﬁne-\ntuning. We also include Emb. Zero.

The\nmethod does not apply to cases where surface pat-\nterns related to bias (e.g., gendered pronouns) are\ncrucial for prediction, e.g., coreference resolution.\n4 Results\nIn this section, we present the results of UBM in\nthree settings following the order in Sec. 2.1: trans-\nferring to the same data distribution, transferring\nto different data distributions, transferring from an\nupstream model with bias mitigation for multiple\nbias factors. We follow these main analyses with\nan investigation of the impact of freezing encoder\nweights before downstream ﬁne-tuning, and lastly\nwith a brief exploration of how UBM’s positive\nresults are achieved.\nImplementation Details. In all experiments re-\nported on below, models are initially ﬁne-tuned\nfrom RoBERTa-base. The upstream model is\ntrained for a ﬁxed number of epochs and the check-\npoint with the best prediction performance is trans-\nferred to the downstream model. See Appendix for\nmore implementation details. We use Ds →Dt as\nthe transfer notation, in which upstream and down-\nstream datasets are respectively represented in the\nleft and right-hand side of the arrow.\n4.1 UBM with the Same Data Distribution\nWe ﬁrst brieﬂy show the results when the down-\nstream model sees new, unseen samples from the\nsame data distribution as the upstream model. In\nthis controlled setting, we isolate and test the basic\nviability of UBM, which requires that information\nfrom the upstream model is retained during down-\nstream ﬁne-tuning. GHC, Stormfront, FDCL and\nBiasBios were partitioned into two subsets with\nequal size, noted as subsets A and B of correspond-\ning datasets, to train the upstream and downstream\nmodels respectively.\nDownstream dataset GHC Stormfront DWMW OntoNotes 5.0\nMetrics In-domainF1 (↑) In-domainFPRD (↓) IPTTSFPRD (↓) NYTAcc (↑) In-domainF1 (↑) In-domainFPRD (↓) IPTTSFPRD (↓) NYTAcc (↑) In-domainAcc.

The source datasets are noted before arrow\n(→). All metrics except In-domain F1 or In-domain Accuracy measures bias. The preferred outcomes for each\nmetric are marked with arrows. The main comparators of UBM are Vanilla, Van-Transfer, Emb. Zero , and\nEmb. Zero. Trans that do not perform downstream bias mitigation. We see UBM maintains in-domain prediction\nperformance while overall reduces bias. Results of Adv. Learning and UBM Adv on GHC, Stf. are not included\nbecause applying adversarial de-biasing to reduce group identiﬁer bias yields degenerated classiﬁers.\nTable 2 presents the results for mitigating group\nidentiﬁer bias in the GHC. We see an overall bias\nreduction, via UBM, by comparing with Vanilla\ntraining and Van-Transfer. We include full results\nand discussions for this simple setting in Appendix.\n4.2 Cross-domain and Task UBM\nFollowing the result that UBM is effective in the\nsame-domain setting, we now move to analyzing\ncross-domain settings in greater depth. For hate\nspeech classiﬁcation, we perform transfer learning\nfrom GHC to Stormfront and from Stormfront to\nGHC; and for toxicity classiﬁcation, we perform\ntransfer learning from FDCL to DWMW. We also\nperform transfer learning from BiasBios (occupa-\ntion prediction) to OntoNotes 5.0 (coreference res-\nolution). Table 3 shows the results of cross-domain\nand task transfer learning and non-transfer base-\nlines. Our ﬁndings are summarized below.\nUBM can reduce bias in different target\ndomains and tasks compared to ﬁne-tuning\nwithout bias mitigation. The results of cross-\ndomain and task transfer learning (i.e., Stf.→GHC,\nGHC→Stf., FDCL→DWMW), show that transfer-\nring from a less biased upstream model (UBMReg\nand UBMAdv) leads to better downstream bias mit-\nigation compared to directly training without bias\nmitigation in the target domain (Vanilla). Mean-\nwhile, the in-domain classiﬁcation performance\nhas improved (on GHC and Stormfront) or been\npreserved (on DWMW). It is notable that directly\nmitigating bias (Expl. Reg., Adv. Learning) on\nDWMW is not effective, which is previously ob-\nserved by Xia et al. (2020), while transferring from\nFDCL is successful.\nThere are exceptions where UBM fails to reduce\nbias. We see the in-domain FPRD on Stormfront\ndoes not improve; however, as discussed in our\nmetrics section, the in-domain FPRD is computed\nover a much smaller set of examples compared to\nNYT and IPTTS datasets, and is thus less reliable.\nUBM does not reduce bias compared to Vanilla\ntraining on OntoNotes 5.0, but achieves less bias\ncompared to Van-Transfer. This result conﬁrms the\neffect of bias mitigation in upstream models, but\nthe transfer learning itself has increased the bias.\nComparison with Emb. Zero and Emb. Zero.\nTrans. We ﬁnd two alternative methods, Emb.\nZero and Emb. Zero Trans, also reduce bias on\nsome of the datasets. On GHC, Emb. Zero achieves\nan in-domain FPRD and IPTTS-FPRD lower than\nUBM. However, it comes with clear drop of in-\ndomain classiﬁcation performance.\n4.3 Mitigating Multiple Bias Factors\nHaving observed an overall positive effect\nof UBM across domains and tasks, next we present\nthe results of experiments on mitigating multiple\nbias factors with a single upstream model. This\ninvolves training an upstream model with multiple\nbias mitigation objectives across multiple datasets,\nfollowed by ﬁne-tuning on a single dataset with-\nout bias mitigation. We test three combinations\nof datasets. First, a multi-task model is trained to\njointly mitigate group identiﬁer bias and AA VE\ndialect bias using GHC and FDCL (GHC + FDCL),\nand transferred to Stormfront and DWMW. Next, a\nmodel is similarly trained jointly on group identi-\nﬁer and AA VE biases on and Stormfront and FDCL\n(Stf. + FDCL) and transferred to GHC and DWMW.\nLastly, models were trained over source datasets\n3We ﬁnd UBMReg,Reg,Adv yield degenerated classiﬁers\nfor OntoNotes (Test F1< 46.00) in 5 out of 6 runs.

The results\nare shown in Table 4.\nComparison to Single-Dataset Vanilla Base-\nlines. As a basic measure of bias mitigation\nsuccess, we compare multi-dataset models’ re-\nsults with single-dataset Vanilla training and Van-\nTransfer. We see UBM with GHC + FDCL success-\nfully reduces both group identiﬁer bias and AA VE\ndialect bias in downstream models. UBM with\nGHC + FDCL + BiasBios also successfully reduces\ngroup identiﬁer bias in terms of IPTTS, FPRD\n(which is the most reliable metrics of bias given its\nlarge size), and AA VE bias. It also reduces gen-\nder stereotypical bias compared to Van-Transfer in\nsome experimental runs, but in an unstable manner,\ndemonstrated by the large variance of F1-Diff and\ndegenerated runs of UBMReg,Reg,Adv.\nResults of UBM on Stf. + FDCL are less promis-\ning. We ﬁnd UBMReg,Adv,Adv is not successful in\nreducing group identiﬁer bias. UBM Reg,Reg,Adv\ncould reduce bias on IPTTS-FPRD, but does not\nimprove other metrics. Notably, UBM on Stf. +\nFDCL clearly underperform UBM on Stf. only.\nUBMReg versus UBM Adv. Empirically, we\nﬁnd using explanation regularization on FDCL\n(UBMreg,reg, UBMreg,reg,adv) instead of adversar-\nial learning (UBMreg,adv, UBMreg,adv,adv) consis-\ntently improves bias mitigation performance on\nother bias factors.\nTakeaways. Our results show it is possible to\nreduce multiple bias factors via UBM. However,\nwe have shown that these effects are not automatic\nfor each new dataset added to upstream models for\nmulti-task bias mitigation.\n4.4 Freezing or Regularizing Model Weights\nIn the experiments above, we have shown that\nthe effect of mitigating bias is partially preserved\nwith simple ﬁne-tuning. Next, we study whether\nfreezing the encoders or discouraging their weight\nchanges improves bias mitigation in the target\ndomain, as they intuitively try to retain effect\nof bias mitigation. However, we ﬁnd a counter-\nintuitive result: these approaches typically do not\nachieve reduced downstream bias, and in fact re-\nduce in-domain classiﬁcation performance. Table 5\nshows the results when we keep the weights frozen\n(Freeze), discouraging weights from changing with\nℓ2-sp regularizer (Li et al., 2018, details in ap-\npendix), or standard ﬁne-tuning (ﬁne-tune). In Stf.\n→GHC, freezing the weights contributed to reduc-\ning the bias, while ℓ2-sp failed to help. In GHC\n→Stf and FDCL →DWMW, freezing the weights\nand ℓ2-sp both increased the bias. A possible rea-\nson is that by freezing the encoder, we reduce its\nexpressive power. As a result, the encoder is prone\n0 1 2 3 4\nEpoch\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25Gradient of (w, x)\n Van.

The cross-marks show the\ngradient measured in the upstream model (before re-\ninitialization of the classiﬁer layer). UBM reg not only\nreduces importance attributed to group identiﬁers, but\nalso the gradient norm of the importance.\nto capture simple but spurious correlations.\n4.5 Investigating Why UBM Reduces Bias\nWe attempt to interpret why ﬁne-tuning from a de-\nbiased upstream model remains less biased during\nﬁne-tuning from the perspective of gradient of im-\nportance attributed to words wrelated to bias fac-\ntors (e.g., group identiﬁers) by the input occlusion\nalgorithm. A large importance attribution usually\ninduces bias. Figure 3 plots the importance attri-\nbution of group identiﬁers φ(w,x) and the norm\nof its gradient w.r.t. parameters θof the encoder g,\nnoted as ||∇θφ(w,x)||2.\nUBM reduces the gradient of φ(w,x), so\nthat φ(w,x) is less likely to change at the be-\nginning of downstream ﬁne-tuning . Fig. 3\nshows UBM has not only reduced value of im-\nportance attributed to spurious patterns, but also re-\nduced their gradients. The gradient norm is highly\nindicative about how the importance φ(w,x) will\nchange in the downstream model, because when the\nloss in Eq. 1 in the upstream model is minimized,\nthe gradient ∇θφ(w,x) has the same norm but the\nopposite direction as the main downstream classiﬁ-\ncation objective ∇θℓc. It implies that whether the\nupstream model converges at an optimum where\nboth objectives agree (i.e., gradients are small) can\nbe an important indicator of the success of UBM.\nThe ﬁgure further shows that the gradient and\nthe value ofφ(w,x) remain small for UBMreg over\nthe whole training process. We leave more study\ninto the training dynamics of UBM as future works.\n5 Related Works\nHere we review approaches that inform the present\nwork (techniques for bias mitigation) and are re-\nlated to the basic idea of UBM.\nMitigating bias in representations. Bias can be\nmitigated directly in representations of data. Zhang\net al. (2018); Beutel et al. (2017) proposed training\na classiﬁer together with an adversarial predictor\nfor sensitive attributes. Madras et al. (2018) further\nstudied re-usable de-biased representations by train-\ning a new downstream classiﬁer (potentially with a\ndifferent classiﬁcation task) using the learned repre-\nsentations. However, this practice relies on frozen\nrepresentations (rather than models themselves),\nwhich precludes the possibility of generating pre-\ndictions for new data.\nMitigating bias in pretrained models. Another\nline of work addresses bias in pretrained mod-\nels (e.g., word vectors, BERT, Zhou et al., 2019;\nMay et al., 2019; Bhardwaj et al., 2020; Liang\net al., 2020). Many such studies again focus on\nbias in frozen data representations, and do not study\ntheir effects on downstream classiﬁers. Others al-\nternatively assess the propagation of bias from pre-\ntrained models to downstream classiﬁers: Ravfogel\net al. (2020) study algorithms for mitigating bias\nin pretrained models by de-biasing the learned rep-\nresentations, which can subsequently be used in\nclassiﬁers as frozen representations.\nTransferring learning of fairness and robust-\nness. A few previous works have studied related\nresearch problems, with signiﬁcant differences to\nour work. Though Schumann et al. (2019) theoreti-\ncally analyzes the transferability of fairness across\ndomains, it assumes simultaneous access of source\nand target domain data, which does not account\nfor transferring upstream bias mitigation to arbi-\ntrary downstream ﬁne-tuned models. Shafahi et al.\n(2020) study transfer learning of robustness to ad-\nversarial attacks under ﬁne-tuning, but do not seek\nto mitigate bias.\n6 Conclusion\nWe observe that the effects of bias mitigation are in-\ndeed transferable in ﬁne-tuning LMs. Future works\nin ﬁne-tuning LMs can use UBM in order to easily\napply the positive effects of bias mitigation meth-\nods to new domains and tasks without customized\nbias mitigation processes or access to sensitive user\ninformation. Though UBM does not rival directly\nmitigating bias on the downstream task, it is more\nefﬁcient and accessible. Future works can develop\nthe effectiveness of UBM beyond the default sce-\nnarios in this paper, and potentially apply it to tasks\nand settings beyond hate speech, toxicity classi-\nﬁcation, occupation prediction, and coreference\nresolution in English corpora.\nBroader Impact Statement\nOur analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Up-\nstream Bias Mitigation for Downstream Fine-\nTuning. As we stated in the paper, the reduced\nefforts of downstream bias mitigation will facili-\ntate broader application of bias mitigation in the\ngrowing deep learning community.\nWhile we may expect to obtain an “off-the-shelf”\nlanguage model that could reduce multiple kinds\nof bias with UBM, we emphasize that proper eval-\nuation of bias may still be required in downstream\nside, especially for guaranteed bias mitigation. Cur-\nrently, our initial analysis of UBM conﬁrms that\nbias mitigation effects are transferable, but does\nnot provide guarantees of bias mitigation or levels\nof bias mitigation in the direct setting. The ﬁnd-\nings in this analysis should identify the potential\nof UBM to the broader NLP and machine learning\ncommunities, which may be extended with new\napproaches within the UBM framework, or inter-\npretation techniques (as in Sec. 4.5).\nReferences\nAlex Beutel, J.

Association for Computational Linguistics.\nA Implementation Details\nA.1 Training Details\nWe use RoBERTa-base as our base model. In the\nbias mitigation phase, models for GHC, Stormfront,\nFDCL, DWMW, and BiasBios are trained with a\nlearning rate 1e−5, and the checkpoint with the\nbest validation F1 or accuracy score is provided to\nthe ﬁne-tuning phase. We train on GHC, FDCL,\nDWMW, BiasBios for maximum 5 epochs and\nStormfront for maximum 10 epochs . The check-\npoint with the best validation in-domain classiﬁca-\ntion performance is kept. In the ﬁne-tuning phase,\nwe try the learning rate 1e−5 and 5e−6, and re-\nport the results with a higher validation in-domain\nclassiﬁcation performance. For the coreference res-\nolution model on OntoNotes 5.0, we adapt existing\ncode implementation4 (Joshi et al., 2019) to support\nloading RoBERTa-base as the base model. We use\nthe same hyperparameter settings as BERT-base in\nthe provided code implementation.\nTo report mean and standard deviation of perfor-\nmance are computed over 3 runs for most of the\nexperiments, with the same set of random seeds;\nfor GHC and Stf. experiments in Table 3, and\nUBMreg,reg,adv on OntoNotes 5.0, we run experi-\nments for 6 runs. Models except coreference reso-\nlution models on OntoNotes, are trained on a single\nGTX 2080 Ti GPU. Coreference resolution models\nare trained on a single Quadro RTX 6000 GPU.\nThe training time per iteration is consistent over\nexperiments in about 1.5 iteration per second, ex-\ncept the conference resolution. The training of\ncoreference resolution model on OntoNotes 5.0\ntakes around 8 hours. The largest dataset among\nother datasets, BiasBios, takes 2 hours to train.\nA.2 Details of Bias Mitigation Algorithms\nFor explanation regularization algorithm, we set\nthe regularization strength αas 0.03 for GHC and\nStormfront experiments, and 0.1 for FDCL and\nDWMW experiments. We regularize importance\nscore on 25 group identiﬁers in (Kennedy et al.,\n2018) for GHC and Stormfront. These group iden-\ntiﬁers the ones that have the largest coefﬁcient in\na bag-of-words linear classiﬁer. For FDCL, we\nextract 50 words with largest coefﬁcient in the bag-\nof-words linear classiﬁer with a AAE dialect prob-\nability higher than 60% (given by the off-the-shelf\nAAE dialect predictor (Blodgett et al., 2016)) on\n4 https://github.com/mandarjoshi90/co\nref\nits own. For adversarial de-biasing, the adversarial\nloss term has the same weight as the classiﬁcation\nloss term.\nA.3 Dataset Details\nGroup Identiﬁer Bias Experiments. We use a\nbalanced split of the GHC dataset, where training,\nvalidation, and the test set consist of 22,767, 1,586,\nand 1,344 examples. We use the union of “human\ndegration” and “call for violence” has the hate la-\nbel, which results in around 9% of hate examples\nfor all the splits. Note that the split is different\nfrom Kennedy et al. (2020) where the test split has\na much higher ratio of hate examples. We use the\nsame split as Kennedy et al. (2020) for the Storm-\nfront dataset, with 7,896, 978, and 1,998 examples\nin training, validation, and test sets. The NYT cor-\npus contain 12.5knon-hate sentences for testing.\nAA VE Dialect Bias Experiments.We follow Sap\net al. (2019) for the split ratio (73/12/15) of the\nDWMW dataset, which results in 17,994, 2,974,\nand 3,718 examples in each split. For the FDCL\ndataset, as only tweet ids are provided and some of\nthe tweets are no longer available, the ﬁnal dataset\nconsists of 41191, 5149, 5149 examples for each\nsplit. We release the tweet ids used in each split.\nFollowing (Xia et al., 2020), we sample 20 k ex-\namples with an AA VE speaker probability (which\nis included in the dataset) greater than 80%. We\nmanually verify a subset of examples in BROD\nfollowing the protocols of (Sap et al., 2019) and\nfound 93% of sentences clearly non-toxic.\nGender Stereotypical Bias Experiments. For the\nBiasBios dataset, we use the same split as Ravfogel\net al. (2020) with 255,710 training examples (65%),\n39,359 validation examples (10%), and 98,344\n(25%) test examples. We use the ofﬁcial dataset\nsplit (Weischedel et al., 2013) for the OntoNotes\n5.0 dataset.\nWe use the same train/test splits between “trans-\nfer” and “non-transfer” setup. Two partitions of\ndatasets used for Same-distribution UBMexper-\niments have a random half of total examples for\ntrain/validation/test splits. For IPTTS/NYT/BROD,\nwe use the same test set across tables.\nA.4 Details of ℓ2-sp Regularizer\nThe ℓ2-sp regularizer (Li et al., 2018) we applied in\nSec. 4.4 penalizes the distance between the weights\nand the initial point of ﬁne-tuning. Formally, let\nw0 be the initial weight of the encoder gt before\nﬁne-tuning, and w be the current weight of gt.
