  "abstract": "The potential of Generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), to transform software development is remarkable. In this paper, we focus on one area in software development called \"code migration\". We define code migration as the process of transitioning the language version of a code repository by converting both the source code and its dependencies. Carefully designing an effective human-AI partnership is essential for boosting developer productivity and faster migrations when performing code migrations. Though human-AI partnerships have been generally explored in the literature, their application to code migrations remains largely unexamined. In this work, we leverage an LLM-based code migration tool called Amazon Q Code Transformation to conduct semi-structured interviews with 11 participants undertaking code migrations. We discuss human's role in the human-AI partnership (human as a director and a reviewer) and define a trust framework based on various model outcomes to earn trust with LLMs. The guidelines presented in this paper offer a vital starting point for designing human-AI partnerships that effectively augment and complement human capabilities in software development with Generative AI.",
