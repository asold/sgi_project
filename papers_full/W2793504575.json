Failure of power trans-\nformers can interrupt power system network operation. Thus, any fault in a transformer\nshould be detected early. Electrical fault in a transformer occurs at high voltage and will even-\ntually cause physical damage to the conductor and insulator of the transformer, leading to the\nreduction of power quality, blackouts and fire, causing a substantial propriety loss. Damage in\na transformer is difficult to be repaired and the transformer replacement is very costly and\nrequires a lot of resources. Therefore, early detection of transformer fault is imperative in\nthe operation and maintenance process of power system networks. This is to ensure correct\ntransformer oil maintenance, cost reduction and good quality of electricity supply to power\nsystems.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01913 66 January 25, 2018 1 / 15\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Illias HA, Zhao Liang W (2018)\nIdentification of transformer fault based on\ndissolved gas analysis using hybrid support vector\nmachine-m odified evolution ary particle swarm\noptimisat ion.

Under high voltage, these gases can\nreact with each other to form various gases such as ethylene (C\n2\nH\n4\n), methane (CH\n4\n), acetylene\n(C\n2\nH\n2\n), hydrogen (H\n2\n), and ethane (C\n2\nH\n6\n). Previous studies have revealed that as temperature\nincreases, gases are generated in the order of H\n2\n, CH\n4\n, C\n2\nH\n6\n, C\n2\nH\n4\nand C\n2\nH\n2\n[1]. Overheating\nand corona typically lead to the insulation material decomposition [2]. Decomposition of insu-\nlation materials such as paper and cellulose in a transformer can be analysed according to the\namount of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) and carbon monoxide (CO) present in the transformer oil.\nThis is due to depolymerisation causes breaking of glucose ring chains in the paper. CO\n2\n, CO\nand H\n2\nO are emitted due to the presence of oxygen atoms in the cellulose materials.\nThe existing methods of detecting the incipient fault in transformer oil are IEC ratio\nmethod, Rogers ratio method, key gas method and Doernenburg ratio method. However, gas\nratio usage is based on experience through correlating amount of gas concentration and the\ntype of fault. Each of this method has disadvantages, rigorous borderline and hidden relation-\nship [3]. For example, key gas method requires a gas of significant amount to exist in the oil\nsample and is unable to give a conclusion in some cases. Thus, improvement on the accuracy\nof the existing method to identify the fault type in transformer oil is important. Utilisation of\nartificial intelligence and optimisation methods has shown convincing results in power trans-\nformer modelling [4, 5]. Artificial intelligence has also been widely applied in transformer\nfault diagnosis and in power systems [6–9].\nIn An-xin Zhao’s work [10], four combustible gases and six combination of gas ratios,\nwhich correlate to six fault types were considered. The accuracy rates were calculated for 117\ncases by different methods. From this work, the best methods of thermal and electrical fault\ndiagnosis are found to be Duval Triangle and KimSW methods [11]. Each method achieves\naccuracy higher than 55%. However, the accuracy according to the total number of cases\nshows various results. Since there are many cases undistinguishable, the accuracy reduces less\nthan 55% for Roger and Doernenburg ratio methods.\nBased on the work in [12], rules of IEC Code and Roger’s ratio were modified to enhance\nthe accuracy of the current version based on 320 samples with its actual fault type. The samples\nwere categorised into six fault types, which are high thermal fault (Tl), low thermal fault,\nmedium thermal fault (T2), low energy discharge (Dl), high energy discharge (D2) and partial\ndischarge (PD). The overall accuracy of the modified Roger’s four ratios increases from\n45.62% to 75.62%. For IEC Code method modification, significant variation was observed\nafter modification for all transformer fault types, where the overall accuracy increases from\n62.81% to 79.38%. Hence, the new version of Roger’s four ratios and IEC Standard Code meth-\nods have the ability to identify the transformer fault with higher accuracy than the unmodified\nversion.\nIn [13], genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVMG) were employed on\npower transformer fault identification, where GA was applied to optimise SVM parameters.\nSVM classifiers were employed to identify the no-fault state, high-energy discharge, low-\nenergy discharge, high-temperature overheating, low- and mid-temperature overheating.\nFrom the results obtained, it was found that SVMG achieves better diagnosis results compared\nto the IEC method, back propagation neural network and SVM alone. Other works have also\nshown that optimisation method can improve the performance of the system significantly [14,\n15].\nPSO and SVM were employed to predict dissolved gas contents in power transformers [16].\nPSO was used to optimise the SVM parameters to avoid under or over-fitting of the SVM\nmodel. It was found that the proposed method achieves better forecasting accuracy than grey\nmodel and artificial neural network (ANN) under small number of samples. In [17], SVM was\nIdentificati on of transforme r fault based on DGA using hybrid SVM-ME PSO\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01913 66 January 25, 2018 2 / 15\nemployed in transformer fault diagnosis on DGA data. One-against-all, one-against-one and\nbinary decision tree were applied. From the results, the highest accuracy was achieved by SVM\none-against-one method, which is 92%.\nIdentification of transformer fault was also proposed using different PSO and ANN tech-\nniques [18]. The PSO optimisation methods employed were traditional PSO, evolutionary\nPSO and iteration PSO. From the fault identification algorithm, ANN-EPSO results in the\nhighest correct identification percentage of transformer fault than the previously reported\nworks and existing DGA methods. In [19], ANN was employed to classify transformer condi-\ntion based 3 combustible gas ratios. Three ratios of combustible gases were applied as the\ninput. From this method, the validation and test set errors have the same characteristics and\nno overfitting.\nAlthough SVM has been applied widely in classification of gas ratio, limited amount of\nwork has been reported on transformer fault identification using SVM combined with various\noptimisation techniques. It is believed that there is room for improvement in combining SVM\nwith various optimisation techniques in identification of power transformer faults. Thus, this\nwork proposes a hybrid SVM with different particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques to\nidentify the transformer faults. Feature selection using stepwise regression was also applied\nprior to the SVM training for data reduction. This was done to enable only meaningful sets of\ndata are used in the training of SVM. The effectiveness of each method was evaluated by com-\nparing the results with the actual fault and existing methods, unoptimised SVM and previous\nworks using ANN. A better result of the proposed method than the previously reported work\nwill indicate that this method can be an alternative solution for transformer fault diagnosis on\nsite.\nThis work is organised as follows. Section 1 is the introduction of this work, which includes\nproblem statement and review of published related works. Section 2 describes the support vec-\ntor machine and feature selection method used in this work. Section 3 explains different types\nof particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques. In Section 4, all findings and analysis are\npresented. Finally, Section 5 is the conclusions, which presents a summary of the key findings.\nIntelligent classifier and feature selection\nSupport vector machine (SVM)\nSVM was introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis, which was derived from statistical learn-\ning theory [20–22]. SVM is useful in dealing with non-linear separable cases [23]. SVM is a\npowerful technique used for data classification and data prediction [24]. The training of SVM\nwas performed where the classified vector dimension has no distinct influence on the SVM\nperformance. Thus, SVM has the capability of handling a very large feature space, giving SVM\nhigher efficiency compared to other classification techniques especially when dealing with\nlarge amount of classification data. Since the past, SVM has been employed widely to solve\nmany practical problems in various fields [25–28]. The flexibility of SVM makes it beneficial in\ntransformer fault identification due to the number of features that forms the fault diagnosis\nbasis is not limited.\nIn this work, radial basis function (RBF) kernel was employed. Two parameters in SVM\nwere optimised by different PSO algorithms in this work, σ and c. σ is a RBF kernel parameter\nwhile c represents the misclassification parameter and determines the trade-off between the\nsize and margin of slack variables [29]. A large c means a higher penalty for non-separable\npoints. A small c is an indication that an under-fit process is occurring. Both c and σ are impor-\ntant as the combination of these two parameters will influence the percentage of correct fault\nidentification by SVM.\nIdentificati on of transforme r fault based on DGA using hybrid SVM-ME PSO\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01913 66 January 25, 2018 3 / 15\nStepwise regression\nFeature selection enables the selection of significant data for training and testing of transformer\nfault type using SVM. This technique prevents the use of a large amount of redundant informa-\ntion and insignificant features in the dataset, which often leads to greater complexity, longer\nrun time and lower accuracy [30]. In this work, stepwise regression technique was employed to\nsimplify the model to be interpreted by the SVM and to reduce the chance of overfitting, giving\na shorter run time while maintaining high percentage of correct fault identification.\nStepwise regression is a regression-based algorithm with automatic filtering features [31]. It\nis utilised to select the important features of the training and testing dataset [32]. Hence, the\nmost significant statistical features are selected by the algorithm. Stepwise regression analyses\nthe significance of the model in term of statistical using partial F-statistic. Enabling users to\ndetermine the type of gases has the greatest influence on the fault type identification.\nIn this work, the forward selection characteristic of stepwise regression was utilised. Each\nterm was removed from or added to the input feature vector with reference to the p-value of\nexiting or entering input data. Null-hypothesis test probability is represented by p-value with α\ntolerance for a term addition and β tolerance for a term removal. In this work, each input data\nrepresents a type of gas obtained from DGA. The input data were selected based on the p-value\nresulted from stepwise regression.\nInput and output data for SVM classifier\nDifferent PSO techniques were employed to optimise the SVM to identify transformer fault\ntype using DGA data obtained from an electrical utility in Malaysia. The parameters of each\nmethod which give the highest percentage of correct fault identification and yield the shortest\ntest time were selected for the optimization objective. Feature selection of training and testing\ndata were carried out using stepwise regression to reduce the run time while maintaining a\nhigh percentage of correct fault identification.\nNumbers of run were tested to examine the performance of each method. The results were\ncompared between different PSO methods with the existing DGA method, which is IEC 60599\nmethod. 400 data from the actual site diagnosis were used in this work. The raw data were clas-\nsified into 64 cases of low and high intensity discharge each, 72 cases of thermal fault and 200\ncases without fault. Table 1 shows the input (dissolved gas) and output data (fault type) used\nfor SVM training and testing. Seventy percent of the overall data was used to train the SVM\nwhile for testing purpose, the remaining data were used.\nParticle swarm optimisation techniques\nConventional PSO\nPSO is an evolutionary computational algorithm to solve non-linear optimisation problems\n[30, 33–36]. The advantage of PSO is the PSO parameters can be empirically adjusted to\nTable 1.

Fig 1 shows a PSO algorithm flowchart to opti-\nmise the performance of SVM. First, swarms were initialised randomly with velocity and initial\nposition of every particle. The swarms are the SVM parameters, c and σ. Then, the fitness for\nevery particle, which is the accuracy of SVM, was calculated with the initial position and veloc-\nity. After that, the fitness of every each particle was compared with its personal best pb\nid\nk\n.\nWhen the new fitness is better than pb\nid\nk\n, it is set as pb\nid\nk\nand X\nid\nk\nor the particle’s current posi-\ntion. The overall best fitness is taken as the global best gb\nd\nk\n. Next, the updated position and\nvelocity of every particle were calculated using\nX\nid\nkþ1\n¼ X\nid\nk\nþ V\nid\nkþ1\nð1Þ\nV\nid\nkþ1\n¼ wV\nid\nk\nþ c\n2\nr\n2\nðgb\nd\nk\n\u0000 X\nid\nk\nÞ þ c\n1\nr\n1\nðpb\nid\nk\n\u0000 X\nid\nk\nÞ ð2Þ\nwhere X\nid\nk+1\nis the new position of particle i, X\nid\nk\nis the previous position of particle i at k-th\niteration, V\nid\nk+1\nis the new particle i velocity in d dimension, V\nid\nk\nis particle i velocity at itera-\ntion k, r\n2\nand r\n1\nare randomly generated number between 0 and 1 and c\n2\nand c\n1\nare the\nFig 1.

If any particle moves out of the bounds, its position is set to the upper or lower bound-\nary. The algorithm was halted when the final number of iteration was reached.\nIteration particle swarm optimisation (IPSO)\nIPSO incorporates the iteration best, Ib in the existing PSO algorithm. Ib is the optimum value\nof fitness function by a particle in an iteration. IPSO improves the quality of the solutions and\nefficiency of the existing PSO [37]. The new velocity equation for each particle in IPSO is given\nby\nV\nid\nkþ1\n¼ wV\nid\nk\nþ c\n3\nr\n3\nðIb\nd\nk\n\u0000 X\nid\nk\nÞ þ c\n2\nr\n2\nðgb\nid\nk\n\u0000 X\nid\nk\nÞ þ c\n1\nr\n1\nðpb\nid\nk\n\u0000 X\nid\nk\nÞ ð4Þ\nwhere Ib\nd\nk\nis the best fitness obtained by any particle at k-th iteration and c\n3\nis the stochastic\nacceleration weight to attract every particle towards Ib\nd\nk\n. c\n3\nis calculated using\nc\n3\n¼ c\n1\n½1 \u0000 expð \u0000 kc\n1\nÞ ð5Þ\nEvolutionary particle swarm optimisation (EPSO)\nEPSO is a meta-heuristic algorithm that combines the concept of PSO and Evolution Strategies\n(ES). This algorithm was introduced by Miranda [38]. EPSO introduces a mutation operation\ninto PSO, causing each particle to have its weight mutated. EPSO provides a procedure of\nexplicit selection with self-adapting properties in its parameters. This allows the solution with\nsuperior characteristic to be passed down from a generation to the next generation. Hence, the\nequation of the updated velocity is modified to\nV\nid\nkþ1\n¼ w\ni0\n\u0003\nV\nid\nk\nþ w\ni1\n\u0003\nðpb\nid\nk\n\u0000 X\nid\nk\nÞ þ w\ni2\n\u0003\nðgb\nid\n\u0003\n\u0000 X\nid\nk\nÞ ð6Þ\nwhere w\ni0\n\u0003\n, w\ni1\n\u0003\nand w\ni2\n\u0003\nare the mutated weight and gb\nid\n\u0003\nis the mutated global best position.\ngb\nid\n\u0003\n, w\ni0\n\u0003\n, w\ni1\n\u0003\nand w\ni2\n\u0003\nare calculated using\ngb\nid\n\u0003\n¼ gb\nid\nk\nþ t\n0\nN ð7Þ\nw\nij\n\u0003\n¼ w\nij\nþ tN ð8Þ\nwhere j = 0, 1 and 2.

For each algorithm, different combinations of PSO parameters were\ntested, which include varying c\n1\n, c\n2\n, w\nmax\nand w\nmin\nto obtain the best accuracy results of SVM.\nEach combination of c\n1\nand c\n2\nwere varied from 0.1 to 2.0 with a step size of 0.1. Each test was\nrepeated for 100 times to obtain the average result. The population size was set to 50. From\nTable 2, it can be seen that each algorithm yields different parameters, average SVM accuracy\nand run time, number of convergence at first iteration and best c and σ. The accuracy of the\nSVM was calculated based on the percentage of correct fault type identification.\nFrom the results obtained, the proposed SVM-MEPSO-TVAC technique yields the highest\naccuracy with an average accuracy of 99.50% and with an average run time of 90.8578s. It is\nfollowed by SVM-MPSO-TVAC with 99.10% accuracy, SVM-EPSO with 99.01% accuracy,\nSVM-IPSO with 99.00% accuracy and finally SVM-PSO with 98.88% accuracy. From 100 runs,\nthe lowest number of run which converges at first iteration was achieved by SVM-PSO, which\nIdentificati on of transforme r fault based on DGA using hybrid SVM-ME PSO\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01913 66 January 25, 2018 7 / 15\nis 27 or 27% while the highest number of run which converges at first iteration is from\nSVM-MEPSO-TVAC, with 93 runs or 93%. When the percentage of convergence at first itera-\ntion is higher, this indicates that the algorithm can be run with less maximum iteration, which\nwill reduce its run time. The shortest average run time is SVM-PSO while the longest average\nrun time is SVM-MEPSO-TVAC.\nThe main advantages of PSO are simple, computation efficient and easy to be implemented.\nThis is why the average run time is the fastest, as shown in Table 2. In PSO, the search towards\nthe optimal solution of the parameter is guided by 2 stochastic acceleration components, the\nsocial and cognitive components. Proper setting of these components is vital to yield accurate\nand efficient search towards the optimum solution. If the cognitive component is higher than\nthe social component, of individuals will be wandering excessively through the searching\nspace. However, if the social component is higher than the cognitive component, particles will\nrush toward a local optimum prematurely. Hence, improvement on PSO algorithm, such as\nallowing the automated search of the stochastic acceleration term weighting and introduction\nof mutation feature has shown enhancement on the average accuracy of the SVM.\nOptimisation of SVM with stepwise regression\nStepwise regression was applied on the input and output data to select gases obtained from\nDGA with the most dominant characteristic in transformer fault identification. The results\nobtained after stepwise regression are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that the data used for\nSVM training and testing displays similar characteristics. The p-value tests the null hypothesis,\nwhich the coefficient equals to zero. A predictor with low p-value as displayed by CO with a\nTable 3.

A smaller\np-value possessed by the gas reflects that the DGA data for that particular gas has a stronger\nassociation with the transformer fault type. In this work, stepwise regression shows that the\ntype of gas in the order of decreasing significance towards the identification of transformer\nfault type for training data and testing data is CO, H\n2\n, C\n2\nH\n6\n, CH\n4\n, C\n2\nH\n2\nand finally C\n2\nH\n4\n.\nStandard error is important to access the strength of the relationship between the model\nmade up of selected features and the response variable. Also, standard error accesses the valid-\nity of the p-values as it represents the distance that the observed values fall from the regression\nline in mathematical form. A smaller standard error equates a better response as the model\nobtained gives observations of the response variable, which is the fault type closer to the fitness\nline. From Table 3, it is observed that there is a small value of standard error with values less\nthan 10\n−4\nfor all types of gases in training and testing data. With p-value and standard error\nshowing small values, it can be deduced that the selected features have a strong relationship\nwith the response variables, where smaller values display a stronger relationship.\nThe regression coefficient in Table 3 shows the change of mean in the response parameter\nfor a unit of change in the specific predictor parameter while the other predictors are kept con-\nstant. For example, in training data, the coefficient for H\n2\nis 0.1692×10\n−3\n. This indicates that\nfor every unit addition in the concentration of H\n2\n, it can be expected that the overall result of\nthe response variable increases by 0.1692×10\n−3\n.\nBased on the stepwise regression results as shown in Table 3, for 3 gas input data, H\n2\n, CO\nand C\n2\nH\n6\nwere used as the input data for testing and training of SVM. These 3 gases are ranked\nat the three lowest p-values. For 4 gas input, H\n2\n, CO, CH\n4\nand C\n2\nH\n6\nwere taken as the input\ngas while for 5 gas input, H\n2\n, CO, CH\n4\n, C\n2\nH\n2\nand C\n2\nH\n6\nwere taken as the input gas. Table 4\nshows the type of gases for training and testing data according to stepwise regression for differ-\nent number of gas input. By decreasing the number of input data applied to SVM, the size of\nthe kernel matrix and complexity of the computing can be reduced, hence reducing the test\ntime.\nTable 5 shows results using MEPSO-TVAC and MPSO-TVAC algorithms on SVM by\nusing different number of gas input for 100 runs. These two algorithms were selected to be\ntested due to their average SVM accuracy is two highest values according to Table 2. From\nTable 5, when 3 gas input was used, the accuracy for SVM-MPSO-TVAC and SVM-MEP-\nSO-TVAC is 99.02% and 99.45% each with average run time of 53.1552s and 55.0159s respec-\ntively. The number of run which converges at first iteration is 97 and 100 out of 99 for\nSVM-MPSO-TVAC and SVM-MEPSO-TVAC respectively. Comparing with 6 gas input data,\nthe average run time for SVM-MPSO-TVAC and SVM-MEPSO-TVAC is 88.5753s and\n90.8578s respectively but the average SVM accuracy is 99.10% and 99.50% for SVM-MPSO-T-\nVAC and SVM-MEPSO-TVAC respectively.\nTable 4.

However, it is\nobvious that the average run time increases significantly when the number of gas input used is\nhigher due to more data are used. The number of convergence at first iteration decreases\nslightly when more gas input is used because the number of particles in PSO algorithm is\nhigher. Therefore, this shows that using data reduction by stepwise regression for SVM train-\ning and testing data, the run time can be reduced significantly without affecting the accuracy\nresults of the SVM.\nFrom Table 5, comparison between SVM-MPSO-TVAC and SVM-MEPSO-TVAC shows\nthat SVM-MEPSO-TVAC has higher number of convergence at first iteration and average\nSVM accuracy than SVM-MPSO-TVAC for different number of gas input data. However, the\naverage run time slightly longer for SVM-MEPSO-TVAC compared to SVM-MPSO-TVA C\nwhen different number of gas input was used. Mutation in the particle weight is a critical\nimprovement in SVM-MEPSO-TVAC over SVM-MPSO-TVAC.\nComparison with the previous works\nThe proposed hybrid SVM with various PSO techniques employed in this work were com-\npared with the existing works in literature on the transformer fault identification according to\ndissolved gas analysis data. Table 6 shows the comparison between the proposed methods and\npreviously developed works. It is observed that the proposed SVM-MEPSO-TVAC method\nresults in the highest accuracy with 99.50% compared to other reported existing works.\nReferring to Table 6, the IEC method yields only 75.00% accuracy. IEC method is based on\nthe existing dissolved gas analysis (DGA) technique, which utilises three different ratios of the\ngas. These include CH\n4\n/H\n2\n, C\n2\nH\n2\n/C\n2\nH\n4\nand C\n2\nH\n4\n/C\n2\nH\n6\n. This method does not depend on\nspecific gas concentrations to exist in the transformer but it is used only when the normal lim-\nits of the individual gases have been exceeded. Hence, it is not suitable to be used in all condi-\ntion of gas concentration. This is why the accuracy obtained using the IEC method in this\nwork is low.\nTable 6.

These are the\nresults obtained from this work. Comparing these results with the IEC method, it shows a sig-\nnificant improvement in the percentage of correct prediction of the fault type, which is over\n20%. Referring to results reported in [18], which applied artificial neural network (ANN) as\nthe classifier, the accuracy results as in Table 6 show that the proposed methods using SVM is\ngenerally higher than using ANN. The accuracy result using ANN-PSO, ANN-IPSO and\nANN-EPSO is 96.00%, 97.00% and 98.00% respectively.\nSVM is a supervised learning machine, which uses mainly the kernel method. SVM locates\nthe decision function from a set of labelled training data. The decision function is made by\nhyperplane, which segregates the training data into two groups. The solution of the classifica-\ntion learning problem is obtained in terms of a subset of training data, also known as support\nvectors. An optimal hyperplane will be selected from all the separating hyperplanes, whereby\nthe margin of separation between itself and any training point is of maximum value. This is\nwhy SVM yields better results than ANN and the IEC method. Therefore, referring to the\nresults shown in Table 6, it has been demonstrated that the hybrid SVM with MEPSO-TVAC\nalgorithm proposed in this work can be an alternative solution for diagnosis of transformer\nfault type based on DGA in industrial practice.\nConclusions\nIn this work, hybrid support vector machine (SVM) with modified particle swarm optimisa-\ntion (PSO) algorithms has been successfully proposed in optimising the SVM performance. In\nthe proposed method, SVM was successfully employed to determine the transformer fault type\nand different algorithms of PSO were employed to optimise the SVM parameters. From results\ncomparison, the proposed hybrid SVM with modified EPSO-Time Varying Acceleration Coef-\nficient (TVAC) yields the best performance in terms of correct identification percentage of\ntransformer fault compared to the current DGA method, unoptimised SVM and the reported\nexisting works. After feature selection using stepwise regression was applied, it was found that\nthere is a significant reduction in the training and testing time but the accuracy of SVM-MEP-\nSO-TVAC is still high when less number of gas input was used. The proposed SVM-MEP-\nSO-TVAC also achieves highest number of convergence at first iteration than other SVM-PSO\nalgorithms. Hence, the proposed SVM-MEPSO-TVAC method combined with feature selec-\ntion using stepwise regression can be proposed as an alternative solution for power trans-\nformer diagnosis.\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.
