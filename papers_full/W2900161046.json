INTRODUTION \nThe paper continues our studies on transient model-\ning three-phase five-limb tr ansformer started in [1]. \nSpeaking generally, the structure of corresponding topo-\nlogical models has been sufficiently elaborated in [2] – \n[4]. So, the main difficulties are related to choosing model \nparameters and their verification under abnormal condi-\ntions. As the core approaches  saturation, an appreciable \nmagnetic flux is closed outside the core. So, the model \nbehavior becomes increasingly dependent on elements \ndetermining the off-core fluxes. \nIt was shown in [1] that accurate model of five-limb \ntransformer, which covers regimes with highly saturated \ncore, can be developed without resorting to a detailed tank \nrepresentation. So, the main elements, which control the \noff-core fluxes, are linear reluctances of the magnetic \ntransformer model or corres ponding inductances of its \nelectrical equivalent. \nIn the presence of reliable experimental data, these \nelements can be found by trial and error method, which \ncan be time-consuming, requiring some practical skills or \nspecial accelerating techniques [4]. \nIn this paper, we propose a method to determine the \nmodel parameters without its fitting to test data obtained \nin regimes with highly saturated core. \nA suitable approach is to make the model reversible \n– that is, accurate in deep saturation, irrespective of which \ntransformer winding is energized [5]. Reversible models \nfor single-phase transformers were then also proposed in \n[6] and [7]. In this paper, the method in [5] is extended to \nfive-limb, three-winding transformer. The model is veri-\nfied by comparing its predictions with results of the GIC-\nimmunity test [8] carried out on two five-limb 400 MVA \ntransformers connected back-t o-back and to the Fingrid \npower network. The accurate m odel predictions in a wide \nrange of dc currents in their neutrals demonstrate that the \nmodel is a reliable tool independent of the core saturation. \nAs another limiting case, we show an adequate model \nbehavior during inrush current events. \n6\nISSN 1607-6761 (Print)       « ЕЛЕКТРОТЕХНІКА ТА ЕЛЕКТРОЕНЕРГЕТИКА» № 3 (2018)          \nI S S N  2 5 2 1 - 6 2 4 4  ( O n l i n e )                    Розділ «Електротехніка»                            \n \n \nII. TOPOLOGICAL TRANSFORMER MODEL \nThe model employed in the study was described in \n[1]. To make the paper self-contained it is shown in fig. 1 \nwhere F1, F2, and F3 represent the sources of magnetomo-\ntive force (MMF) of the innermost, middle, and the out-\nermost windings 1, 2, and 3 with number of turns N1, N2, \nand N3 respectively. The innermost channel 0-1 and the \nequivalent leakage channels 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 are character-\nized by the linear reluctances R\n01, R12, and  R 23 respec-\ntively. The negative (fictitious) reluctances Rp are added \nto match all three binary short-circuit inductances [3]. \n \nFigure 1.

Electrical model of the three-winding five-limb \ntransformer. \nThe winding resistances r1, r2, and r3 are brought \noutside the inductive part of the model. Resistances \nRinf = 109 Ω make the innermost windings 1 effectively \nopen-circuited and the delta-connected windings 3 \nunloaded in accordance with [8]. \nTo match the binary short-circuit inductances LS12, \nLS23, and LS13 measured in [8], the conventional star-\nconnected inductances L12, L2 3, and Lp are used in the \nmodel of fig. 2. The negative value of Lp is found as \n(LS12 + LS23 – LS13)/2 [1], then L12 = LS12 – Lp, and \nL23 = LS23 – Lp. Going back to the magnetic circuit in \nfig. 1, we find its reluctances as 12\n2\n212 L/NR = , \n23\n2\n223 L/NR = , and p\n2\n2p L/NR = . \nIn the derivation, we will also use the air-core in-\nductances of the windings [8], calculated by the manufac-\nturer in the absence of the co re. Their values are provided \nin Section IV together with nameplate data of the trans-\nformer considered. \nIII. OBTAINING REVERSIBLE MODEL \nThe method of obtaining reversible model is to find \nits parameters so that the inductance of any single wind-\ning of the saturated core is equal to its air-core inductance \nLair. Consequently, the  parameters of the magnetic model \nin fig. 1 should be chosen so that the input reluctance Rin \nseen from the terminals of  any MMF source associated \nwith an N-turn winding is equal to the reluctance corre-\nsponding to the inductances of this winding on air, \nair2air / LNR = , when the other windings are open, i.e. the \ncorresponding MMF sources are short-circuited. \nThe reluctances of completely saturated legs ( RL), \nyokes ( RY), and the end limbs ( RE) are calculated as \n)/( 0 AlR μ=  where l and A are their lengths and cross \nsections, and μ0=4π⋅10-7 H/m. The core air gaps are in-\ncluded into the saturated legs, so we can accept that Rg=0. \nConsequently, only four elements of the magnetic scheme \nin fig. 1, namely R01, R03, R03B, and R04, remain to be \nevaluated. \nAccounting for the central symmetry of the five-\nlimb transformer, we can consider the windings of only \ntwo neighboring legs and thus write six equations of the \ntype of Rin = Rair, so the problem is overdetermined. Sig-\nnificant facilitation of its solution in comparison to that in \n[9] is achieved when building the model reversible for \ntwo windings, innermost and outermost. This simplifica-\ntion is justified by the fact [10] that the winding induct-\nances in air, and thus their binary short-circuit induct-\nances are determined by the geometry and relative posi-\ntion of the actual coils. The reversibility of the model for \nthe middle winding is then verified at the end of the deri-\nvation. \nWhen building reversible model of two-winding \ntransformer, we should remember that the windings of all \nthree legs are identical. This allows us to divide the prob-\nlem into two parts. The first one is finding reluctance R\n01 \nof the innermost channel, and the second is the calculation \nof reluctances R\n03, R03B, and R04. \nIn the derivation, we take into account that the open-\ning of a  winding shorts the corr esponding MMF source. \nThis means that supplying the windings of only one of the \nRab \nR04 \nRd \nR04 \nRf\nRb Rc Ra \nR01 \nR12 \nR23 \nRg \nFM \nFH \nR03 FL \nRp \nR03 R03 \nRbc \n7\nISSN 1607-6761 (Print)       « ЕЛЕКТРОТЕХНІКА ТА ЕЛЕКТРОЕНЕРГЕТИКА» № 3 (2018)          \nI S S N  2 5 2 1 - 6 2 4 4  ( O n l i n e )                    Розділ «Електротехніка»                            \n \n \nlegs (А, В or С) and keeping the other transformer wind-\nings open, the scheme in fig. 1 is reduced to that in fig. \n3(a).

(1) \nThe leakage reluctance between the windings 1 and \n3 is determined as \n \n2312\n2312\n13 RR\nRRR += .  (2) \nThe element Rrest represents the resultant reluctance \nof all magnetic paths outside the outermost winding of \nany leg. As the windings of all three legs are identical, the \nvalues of R\nrest and R1p are the same for all three legs. So, \nregardless of the leg (A or B), the scheme in fig. 3(b) has \nonly two unknown parameters, R\nrest and R1p. To find them, \nwe can write relationships for two input reluctances, in\n1R  \nand in\n3R , seen from the MMF sources F1 and F3 in fig. \n3(b). Then the imposed equalities in\n3R  = air\n3R  and \nin\n1R  = air\n1R  become two simultaneous equations for R1p \nand Rrest: \n air\n3\np113\np113\nrest RRR\nRR\nR =++ , (3) \n  air\n1\nrest13\nrest13\n1p RRR\nRRR =++ .

This means that for any fixed R04 there is \na pair of R03 and R03В, which nullifies (14). This suggests \nto exclude R04 from vector X and chose R04 from physical \nconsiderations. \nIV. PARAMETERS AND BEHAVIOR OF THE \nREVERSIBLE MODEL \nThe results in this Section relate to YNyn0d11 \n400/400/125 MVA transformer described in [8]. Its wye-\nconnected 120-kV windings ar e nearest to the core, the \n410-kV windings are in the middle, and the outermost are \ndelta-connected 21-kV windings. The numbers of turns \nN\n1, N2, and N3 in these windings are 224, 766, and 68. \nThe air-core inductances of th e windings are as follows: \nair\n1L = 24.9 mH, air\n2L = 496 mH, and air\n3L = 7.1 mH. \nModel parameters. In accordance with the method \nin Section III, reluctances RL, RY, and RE of the saturated \ncore are calculated using the lengths and cross sections \ngiven in [1]. \nThe percentage short-circu it reactances provided in \n[8] yield the following binary  short-circuit inductances \nreferred to N2 turns: LS12 = 263.5 mH, LS23 = 540.4 mH, \nand LS13 = 877.5 mH. These give the following induct-\nances of the electrical model in fig. 2: L12 = 300.313 mH, \nL23 = 577.216 mH, and Lp = – 36.787 mH. \nTo use the method in S ection III, inductances L12, \nL23, Lp, as well as three air-core inductances Lair from [8], \nare recalculated into corre sponding reluctances. Then \nusing (6) and (5) we find that R1p = 1.888 106 1/H and Rrest \n= 1.575 105 1/H. Now, it follows from (7) that R01 = 4.605 \n106 1/H and thus L01 is 127.42 mH or 0.095 pu. \nFollowing [3], we can use the coefficient K = \nL01/LS12 whereby L01 is related to the inductance LS12 of \nthe nearest leakage channel 1-2.  It is remarkable that the \nfound value of K (0.4835) is close to the value of 0.5 \nhard-coded in the hybrid transformer model [11]. \nTo evaluate the influence of R04, it is convenient to \nuse the corresponding inductance, 04\n2\n204 / RNL = . Three \nper-unit values of L04 in Table I are for the cases when \nL04 = LS12 (= 0.197 pu); when L04 is equal to the induc-\ntance of the saturated yoke (0.064 pu), and when induct-\nances L04 are absent in the model of fig. 2. The compo-\nnents of vector [ ]B0303, RR=X , which nullify (14) for \neach R04 (i.e. L04), are represented in Table I by pu values \nof corresponding inductances.  \nThe fact that L03 and L03B are by order of magnitude \ngreater than LS12 is explained by different “cross-sections” \nof the corresponding flux paths: the zero-sequence flux is \ndistributed over the whole transformer volume, whereas \nthe leakage flux is confined to the thin tube of the channel \n1-2. \nTable 1.

The \nelectrical model in fig. 2 was verified by simulation of the \nexperimental setup in [8] consisting of two 400 MVA \ntransformers (T1 and T2) arranged in parallel relative to \nthe power network and connected  in series regarding the \ncommon dc current in the tr ansformers' neutrals. This \nmodel configuration and its parameters are shown in fig. 4 \nof [1]. \nIt was assumed that the cores of these transformers \nare assembled from grain-oriented steel 27ZDKH85. The \nDHM-inductor of this steel can be taken at [12] or in the \ncurrent version of EMTP-ATP [13]. \nTo observe transformer dyna mics in the presence of \nthe geomagnetically-induced current (GIC), it is supposed \nthat the biasing step voltage appears at t = 2 s. The fol-\nlowing transient is characteri zed by a growth in the reac-\ntive power Q consumed by transformers and increasing \nwinding currents as shown in fig. 4(a). \nThe model parameters in Table I were first used to \ncheck the model's ability to reproduce transformer behav-\nior at maximum dc current in the neutrals ( I\ndc = 200 A) \nreached in [8]. As  the currents obtained are almost indis-\ntinguishable from those in [1], we do not show them in \nthis paper. We only note that the reactive power Q 2 con-\nsumed by transformer T2 at Idc = 200 A is close to 55 \nMvar reported in [8]. \nIn the context of the present study, it was important \nto verify the model at lower neutral current, say at Idc = 75 \nA. The corresponding transient is illustrated by fig. 4(a), \n9\nISSN 1607-6761 (Print)       « ЕЛЕКТРОТЕХНІКА ТА ЕЛЕКТРОЕНЕРГЕТИКА» № 3 (2018)          \nI S S N  2 5 2 1 - 6 2 4 4  ( O n l i n e )                    Розділ «Електротехніка»                            \n \n \nwhich shows the evolution of phase currents B and C of \nT2. The current waveforms in steady-state are given in \nfig. 4(b) to show their clos e agreement with the measured \ncurrents in fig. 5 recorded at 75 A dc current in the HV \nneutrals. The same agreement with test results was also \nobtained for the currents in the network as can be seen \nfrom comparing the waveforms in fig. 6(a) and fig. 6(b). \nThe values of the reactive power Q 2, given in the last col-\numn of Table I, are in a fairly good agreement with the \nlinear dependence Q2(Idc) observed in [8]. \nThe importance of these findings lies in the fact that \nthe model parameters found for completely saturated core \nare also valid for modeling other transformer transients. \n \nFigure 4. Predicted transient (a) and steady-state (b) \nphase currents of transformer T2 at the neutral GIC of 75 \nA. \n \nFigure 5. Measured phase currents B and C of trans-\nformer T2 at the neutral GIC of  75 A. Note that current A \nwas not measured and is assumed by analogy with that in \nfig. 4(b). \nIt should be noted that the model is not very sensi-\ntive to changes in its parameters if the model remains \nreversible. For example, the currents calculated for the \nmodel parameters in all three rows of Table I are not visi-\nbly different from those in fig. 4(b). As seen in the last \ncolumns of Table I, only a small difference is observed \nbetween the values of co rresponding reactive power Q\n2 \nconsumed by T2. \nIt was found by numerical experiments that all the re-\nsults calculated in the presence of GIC with non-\nhysteretic outlined in [1] and hysteretic model in fig. 2 \nalmost coincide. This relates, for instance, to the current \nwaveforms in fig. 4(b). \n \nFigure 6. Predicted (a) and measured network currents at \nIdc = 75 A (b) \nModel verification by simulation of inrush cur-\nrents. The hysteresis and non-hysteresis transformer \nmodels were also compared against each other in simulat-\ning inrush currents. To con centrate on the transformer \nonly and compare the first (m aximum) current peaks, we \nhave assumed an idealized (410-kV) power network and \nthe worst condition of excitation, when the phase voltage \n)sin()( m tVtv ω=  is switched (at t = 0) to the winding ( N \nturns) of the leg with cross section Sleg. Before exciting \nhysteresis transformer model, all the core sections were \nbrought into the demagnetized state using an inbuilt pro-\ncedure of the DHM. \nThe currents in fig. 7 are calculated by the trans-\nformer model in fig. 2 supposing that the sinusoidal volt-\nage is applied to the high-voltage (HV) winding of phase \nA. \nIt was instructive to compar e the height of the first \ncurrent peak in fig. 7 with  the value calculated analyti-\ncally.

Predicted inrush currents in phases of the HV \nwinding. The horizontal mark shows the current peak \ncalculated with (15). \nThe value Im = 1719.7 A, calculated with (15), is \nshown in fig. 7 by the horizontal line (15), which is at the \nsame level with the current peaks calculated with hystere-\nsis and non-hysteresis transformer models (1718.0 A and \n1720.8 A respectively). \nThe same negligible diffe rence between the current \npeak (10039.3 A) calculated w ith (15) and that predicted \nby the models (9987.5 A) takes place when the trans-\nformer is excited from its MV side, i.e. from the inner-\nmost windings. Finally, when the outermost delta winding \nof the model is opened, the calculated current peaks are \ndecreased by 1.9% at the HV excitation, and by 0.05% at \nthe MV energizations. \nIt worth noting that (15) is derived supposing a coil \nwhose core material has piecewise linear B-H curve with \ntwo slopes and the bending point at B = BS. The first seg-\nment of the curve is stri ctly vertical, while at B>BS the \ncoil's inductance becomes equal to Lair. This means that \nthe slope of the second segment is equal to µ0. \nThe modeling above illustrates the model reversibil-\nity and corroborates the conclusion in [14] that the two-\nslope magnetizing curve can be used to evaluate inrush \ncurrents in large three-phase transformers. At the same \ntime, it was noted in [14] that it is critical to identify the \nproper saturation level (knee point). It was pointed out in \n[5], however, that the notions of saturation and knee are \nsomewhat ambiguous. For this reason, it is better to use \nthe whole B-H curve, which can be represented easily by \nseveral dozen points in the EMTP software. Such a uni-\nversal representation is also preferable in predicting in-\nrush currents accompanied by moderate saturation, when \nthe flux density does not exceed 1.9–2.0 Tesla [14]. \nWhen using the non-hysteresis version of the model, \nthe single-valued B-H curve of the steel employed is con-\nverted into the flux-current curves of the core sections \nusing the well-known relationships SNB ⋅⋅=λ  and \nNHli /⋅= , where S and l are cross section and length of \nthe section, and N is the common number of turns at \nwhich the model is referred to (here N = N2). \nThe users of ATP can employ DHM-inductors, in \nwhich the chosen steel, as well as N, S, and l are set in the \ninductor window. It should be remembered that the hys-\nteretic (DHM-based) transformer model retains the rema-\nnent flux densities in the core sections and is more accu-\nrate in predicting current peaks during subsequent trans-\nformer energizations. It can be also fitted so as to repro-\nduce the measured no-load transformer losses in a wide \nrange of terminal voltages [15]. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThis paper has proposed a method of obtaining a re-\nversible topological model of five-limb, three winding \ntransformer. A distinguishing feature of the method is its \nability to determine the model parameters without fitting \nto experimental data obtained in conditions with highly \nsaturated core. The validity of the obtained model was \nverified by simulating transformer behavior under GIC \nconditions. To do this, we have used parameters and field \ntest results from two 400 MVA transformers at 75- and \n200-A dc currents entering their neutrals. \nWe have observed that both hysteretic and non-\nhysteretic transformer models are equally suitable to re-\nproduce the behavior of the five-limb transformer in the \npresence of GIC. \nIn the general-purpose modeling of five-limb trans-\nformers, the users of ATP may also employ the hysteretic \nversion of the model. In this case, the dynamic hysteresis \nmodel (DHM) included in the current version of ATP [13] \ncan be used.  \nIn general, the model proposed does not require de-\ntailed information on the core, and the preliminary model-\ning was carried out using the core geometry different \nfrom the real one [1]. If the air core inductances of the \nwindings are unknown and it is impossible to ensure the \nmodel reversibility, the linear inductances L\n03 and L03B in \nthe model of fig. 2 may be set equal to 2-3 pu, as seen in \nTable 1, or 10 − 15 times the short-circuit transformer \ninductance. \nThe hysteresis and non-hysteresis transformer mod-\nels were also compared against each other in simulating \ninrush currents when model reversibility was verified by \ncomparing current peaks on the HV and MV sides with \naccurate analytical predictions. \nREFERENCE \n[1] Zirka, S., Moroz, Y., Arturi, C., & Bonnman, D. \n(2018).
