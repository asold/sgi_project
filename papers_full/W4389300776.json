These smart \nglasses come with several improvements, including enhanced \naudio and cameras, over and a lighter design. The glasses are \nequipped with an ultra-wide 12 megapixel camera and immersive \naudio recording capabilities, allowing users to capture moments \nwith a high level of detail and depth (Fig. 1 ) [ 1 , 2 ]. These smart \nglasses are part of Meta’s efforts to develop AR and VR \ntechnologies. In addition, the glasses are equipped with AI- \npowered assistants like Meta AI [ 1 ].\nRay-Ban Meta smart glasses also represent a promising \ndevelopment in assistive technology for individuals with visual \nimpairments and have the potential to significantly enhance their \nquality of life. The field of assistive technology has been \nadvancing rapidly in recent years, particularly due to significant \nadvances in artificial intelligence [ 3 ] and augmented reality [ 4 ]. \nEnvision is currently one of the leading smart glasses developers, \nand their technology allows visual information to be articulated \ninto speech for individuals with vision impairments. A recent \nupdate included GPT integration, allowing users to ask the glasses \nspecific questions, like to summarize text, or only reading vegan \nitems from a menu. GPT-4 [ 5 ]. Future updates will further increase \nthe usefulness of this integration [ 6 ].\nThe Envision smart glasses are built on the Google Glass \nEnterprise Edition 2 (now discontinued), and the high price of \nthe Google smart glasses likely posed as a barrier of the \nadoption to this helpful technology in vision impaired indivi -\nduals. Lowering the cost of assistive technologies is essential, \nas previous research in the UK found a staggeringly low \nemployment rate of 26% for blind and partially sighted working \nage individuals [ 7 ].\nBy Meta attempting to make smart glasses a mainstream \ntechnology, the cost of smart glasses will continue to decrease in \nthe coming years. The incorporated advanced camera technology \ncan provide real-time image processing, while the built in AI can \nrecognize objects and convert this visual information into speech [ 1 ]. \nAn update planned within the next year is expected to allow users to \nask Meta AI questions about what they are looking at. Users can \npotentially interact with these assistants to receive auditory \ninformation about their environment, read text aloud, recognize \nfaces, or get directions, which can be invaluable for individuals with \nvisual impairments (Fig. 2 ). Future incorporation of GPS navigation \naccompanied with audio cues facilitates self-navigating for indivi -\nduals with visual impairments in new environments. Previous \nresearch in the U.K. showed that nearly 40% of blind and partially \nsighted individuals are not currently able to complete all of the \njourney that they need or wish to make [ 7 ]. Better accessibility \nthrough the usage of smart glasses can lead to greater independence \nfor individuals with vision impairments.\nMeta hopes to incorporate augmented reality in future versions \nof smart glasses, and describes the current stage as a stepping \nstone to true augmented reality. Users with vision impairments \nwould benefit highly from true augmented reality glasses, with \npotential features like magnification, contrast enhancement, and \ncolor correction, enhancing their ability to see and navigate their \nsurroundings more effectively. Meta’s future augmented reality \nwork will be compared to the Apple Vision Pro, which is also \nlooking to make mixed reality devices mainstream [ 8 , 9 ]. Further \nresearch will also be required to minimize the variability between \nvarious different VR/AR devices prior to clinical use [ 10 ]. We look \nforward to continued advances in augmented reality with AI \nintegration, and believe this technology can revolutionize how \nindividuals with vision impairments interact with the world.\n1\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. \n2\nDepartment of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center, Ann \nArbor, MI, USA. \n3\nUniversity College Dublin School of Medicine, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland. \n4\nHuman-Machine Perception Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and \nEngineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, NV, USA. \n5\nCenter for Space Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. \n6\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, Blanton Eye \nInstitute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA. \n7\nThe Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA. \n8\nDepartments of \nOphthalmology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. \n9\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, \nUSA. \n10\nUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. \n11\nTexas A&M College of Medicine, Bryan, TX, USA. \n12\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, The University of \nIowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA. \n✉\nemail: ew690@cam.ac.uk\nReceived: 17 October 2023 Revised: 1 November 2023 Accepted: 10 November 2023 \nPublished online: 4 December 2023\n1234567 890();,:\nFig. 1 Technology components of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.
