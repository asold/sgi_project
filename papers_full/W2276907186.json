Smart\ntransformer (ST) based on power electronics, control, and com-\nmunication has been proposed for improving the performance of\npower system. However, operational capabilities and applications\nof ST with RES and energy storage in distribution system are\nstill not explored in detail. In this paper, a new prospective of\nST application, dual microgrid (DMG) operation, is proposed.\nIn normal medium voltage (MV) grid operation, the ST supplies\npower to loads connected to its low voltage side and injects\ninto the MV grid depending upon the available RES and load\ndemand. During the voltage disturbances, the ST feeds power\nto the sensitive loads connected to the other feeders equipped\nwith the conventional power transformers. In this case, the\ndistribution loads are isolated from the MV utility grid. This\nability of the smart transformer to isolate from the utility grid\nand provide continuous power to the sensitive loads of other\nfeeders has potential to signiﬁcantly improve the performance\nof power system as well as ST. With simulation results based\non PSCAD/EMTDC software, this paper introduces for the ﬁrst\ntime an unexplored feature of the smart transformer.\nIndex Terms—Smart transformer (ST), dual microgrid (DMG),\npower distribution system.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe structure of modern power distribution system has been\nchanging tremendously with ever increasing connection of\npower electronics devices and distribution generators such as\nphotovoltaic system, wind system, storage, etc. One of the\nmost enabling technology which is expected to be integrated\ninto the future distribution system is smart transformer (ST),\nwhich is a solid state transformer (SST) equipped with effec-\ntive control and communication, at the place of conventional\npower transformer (CPT) [1]–[4].\nA three-stage ST connects medium voltage (MV) power\nsystem to low voltage (LV) distribution system with interme-\ndiate dc links. In addition to providing features like voltage\ntransformation and isolation between the MV and LV sides\nsimilar to CPTs, the ST has ability to provide additional\nfeatures such as balanced sinusoidal voltage in LV distribution\nsystem, balanced sinusoidal unity power factor current in the\nMV grid side, no effect of MV side disturbances like sag,\nswell, transients etc., on the loads, availability of LV dc link for\nintegration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and storage,\netc. [4]–[8].\nIn ST applications, integration of distributed generation\nand storage to the low voltage dc link is one of the key\nSmart Transformer\nMV DC\nAC/DC DC/DC DC/AC\nLV DC\nLV \nAC\nPV\nWind\nDiesel\nStorage\nLoads\nMV \nAC\nFig. 1. A schematic of ST in distribution system for microgrid operation.\nrequirements [9]–[13]. In this scenario, a microgrid operation\nof the ST has been reported. A typical microgrid operation of\nST is shown in Fig. 1. In this operation, the ST is connected to\nthe MV system during normal operation and supplies power\nto the loads connected to its low voltage side or inject into\nthe MV grid depending upon the available RES and load\ndemand. During the voltage disturbances due to either fault\nin the MV network or intentional disconnection from the MV\ngrid for maintenance purpose, the ST is disconnected from the\nMV supply and it feeds power to the loads connected to the\nlow voltage side. Moreover, proper communication network\nnecessarily be integrated into the ST application for stable and\noptimal operation of the power distribution system for normal\nand microgrid operation.\nBased on different available features of ST like i) bi-\ndirection power transfer capability, ii) integration of RES\nand storage at the LV and MV dc links, iii) intelligent\ncommunication network availability, this paper proposes a new\nprospective of ST application, called dual microgrid (DMG)\noperation. In a power distribution system, several feeders are\nconnected to the common MV network through the individual\nCPTs. One of the CPTs in the power system is replaced by\nthe ST. In the proposed DMG operation, the ST operates\nin voltage control mode to maintain a constant balanced\nsinusoidal voltage at the MV terminal and provides power\nto the loads of other feeders connected through the CPT\nduring the islanding operation. This operation of ST provides\ncontinuous power to the sensitive loads connected to other\ndistribution feeders, enhances the utilization of the ST, and\nmanages the RES and storage in a more effective way. The\nperformance of the proposed operation of ST is veriﬁed using\nvs\nRs\nLs\nSmart \nTransformer\n11 kV distribution \nfeeder\nFeeder 1Feeder 2Feeder 3\nPCC\nLoad\nLoad\nLoad\nLoad\nLoad\nLoad\nLoad\nLoad\nLoad\nDG\nDG\nLoad Load Load\n11/0.4 kV 11/0.4 kV 11/0.4 kV\n132/11 kV\nSTS\nFig. 2. Proposed power distribution system consisting of ST in dual microgrid (DMG) operation.\nPSCAD simulation software in Section IV .\nII. D ESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\nFig. 2 shows a single line representation of the ST based\nDMG system used for the investigation in this paper. The\nutility network is simpliﬁed to the Thevenin’s equivalent\nof voltage vs and grid impedance Rs + jXs. The system\nconsists of 11 kV , three feeder distribution subsystem and it\nis connected to the 132 kV utility grid. One of the CPT in\nthe system has been replaced by the ST, whereas loads at the\ntwo of the feeders are supplied through the CPTs. Different\nkinds of loads such as nonlinear load, unbalanced loads, single\nphase loads, etc., are connected to the all three feeders. Few\nof the loads in all three feeders are critical loads that require\ncontinuous power supply for satisfactory operation.\nWith the ability to have integration of renewable energy\nresources, different sources such as PV , wind generation, diesel\ngenerator, different storage, etc., are assumed to be connected\nto the dc link of the ST. Under normal operating conditions,\nthe DMG based ST is connected to the HV utility network\nthrough a static transfer switch (STS) as shown in the Fig. 2.\nThe loads connected to the LV side of feeder 1 are connected\nto the ST. Therefore, these loads will be supplied by the ST\nby taking power either through the RES or utility. Moreover,\nthe loads connected to the feeder 2 and feeder 3 are supplied\nby the utility or RES available at ST.\nDuring faults in the MV network or due to intentional\ndisconnection from the MV grid for maintenance purpose,\nthe STS operates and disconnects the PCC from the utility\nmains. In this situation, the distributed generation and storage\nintegrated at the ST is the only source of power available to\nfeed the critical loads. In this work, the mode of operation\nof MV rectiﬁer is transferred from current control mode\n(CCM) to voltage control mode (VCM). The MV rectiﬁer\nregulates the PCC voltage at the constant value of 11 kV and\nsupplies uninterrupted power to the critical loads connected\nto the feeders 2 and 3 within the considered DMG operation.\nHowever, once the fault is cleared, the STS needs to be closed\nand the system needs to be re-synchronized to the utility mains\nto restore the normal operation of the system. Moreover, the\nsynchronization is possible only when the utility voltages and\nfrequencies are within the permissible range for a reasonable\namount of time.\nIII. C ONTROL AND OPERATION OF THE ST BASED DMG\nIn this work, a three stage smart transformer with two\nintermediate dc links has been used. The single phase equiv-\nalent circuit is given in Fig. 3. The operating principle of\nthe dc-ac converter will be same throughout the operations.\nThe dc-dc converter also continues to operate similarly with\nthe possibility of reversal in power ﬂow during transients.\nHowever, the operation of the MV ac-dc rectiﬁer changes from\nCCM to VCM and vice-versa during the mode changeovers\nfor the operation of DMG system. This section gives a brief\nidea of operation of dc-dc converter and LV ac-dc converter,\nalong with a detailed operation of MV ac-dc rectiﬁer.\nA. Normal Operation of the ST\n1) Operation of the Rectiﬁer: In normal operating condi-\ntions when the MV utility voltage lies between the 0.9 to 1.1\np.u., the ST works in grid connected mode. In this mode of\noperation, the ST provides power to loads connected to its low\nvoltage side and injects remaining power into the MV grid\ndepending upon the available RES and load demand. Also,\nthe ST provides load compensation features to compensate\nreactive and harmonic components of currents of other feeders.\nTo compute the reference MV grid currents that must be sup-\nplied/absorbed by the MV rectiﬁer, instantaneous symmetrical\ncomponent theory based reference generation scheme is used\nvs\nRs Ls\nDC-DC \nConverter\nEquivalent of Feeders 2 \nand 3\nFeeder 1\nis\nif\nil\nvt\nPCC\nn\nVdc1\nVdc2\nRf Lf\nVdc1\nVdc2\nRf Lf\nDifferent loads\nCsh\nDifferent loads\nMV side LV side\nCsh\nFig. 3. Single phase ST in the proposed scheme.\n[14]. The reference rectiﬁer currents which take care of real\npower exchange between the ST and MV grid are computed\nas follows:\ni∗\nrga = v+\nta1\n(v+\nta1)2 + (v+\ntb1)2 + (v+\ntc1)2 (Pload1 −Pres)\ni∗\nrgb = v+\ntb1\n(v+\nta1)2 + (v+\ntb1)2 + (v+\ntc1)2 (Pload1 −Pres)\ni∗\nrgc = v+\ntc1\n(v+\nta1)2 + (v+\ntb1)2 + (v+\ntc1)2 (Pload1 −Pres).\n(1)\nIn (1), the terms v+\nta1, v+\ntb1, and v+\ntc1 are fundamental positive\nsequence PCC voltages in three phases. The power Pload1 is\nthe average load power demand of feeder I, whereas Pres\nis power from renewable energy resources available at the\ndc bus of the ST. The power Pload1 is obtained through a\nlocal communication between the MV and LV sides. Here,\nthe fundamental positive sequence of phase- a PCC voltage is\nset as reference waveform. For determining the frequency and\nangle reference of the PCC voltage, a phase locked loop (PLL)\nas shown in Fig. 4 is used.\nFurther, the MV rectiﬁer is also used to compensate for\nthe unbalance and nonlinear current components of the loads\nconnected to the feeders 2 and 3. This makes the total grid\ncurrent at the MV side sinusoidal balanced and MV grid\nsees only a balanced resistive load at the PCC. The reference\ncurrents, which is called reference ﬁlter current here, that need\nto be supplied by the ST in the MV side to achieve these\nadvantages is as follows:\ni∗\nfga = il2a + il3a − v+\nta1\n(v+\nta1)2 + (v+\ntb1)2 + (v+\ntc1)2 (Pload2 + Pload3)\ni∗\nfgb = il2b + il3b − v+\ntb1\n(v+\nta1)2 + (v+\ntb1)2 + (v+\ntc1)2 (Pload2 + Pload3)\ni∗\nfgc = il2c + il3c − v+\ntc1\n(v+\nta1)2 + (v+\ntb1)2 + (v+\ntc1)2 (Pload2 + Pload3)\n(2)\nIn above equation, the currents i∗\nfgj , il2j, and il3j are reference\nﬁlter current, feeder 2 and feeder 3 current, respectively where\nj = a,b,c . Also, the powers Pload2 and Pload3 represent\naverage load powers in feeder 2 and 3 respectively.\nFrom above, it is clear that the rectiﬁer can provide load\ncompensation in the considered system with an effective\ncontrol in additional to supplying power to loads connected to\nfeeder 1. Therefore, the total reference currents of the rectiﬁer\ncircuit (i∗\nrec−a, i∗\nrec−b, and i∗\nrec−c) are given as\ni∗\nrec−a = −i∗\nrga + k1i∗\nfga\ni∗\nrec−a = −i∗\nrgb + k1i∗\nfgb\ni∗\nrec−a = −i∗\nrgc + k1i∗\nfgc\n(3)\nIn the above equation, the term k1 can have a value of\neither 1 or 0. The value 1 is selected when the control for load\ncompensation of other feeders is activated, otherwise it will be\nset to 0. Therefore, depending upon the operating conditions\nof the power distribution system, the reference currents for\nrectiﬁer circuit are selected.\n2) Operation of the dc-dc Converter: In this work, the\ndc-dc converter is operated in such a way that it maintains\nMV dc link voltage at the constant reference voltage and\nmaintains power ﬂow between the MV and LV dc links.\nMoreover, the LV dc link voltage is maintained constant by\nthe available renewable sources. Here, a closed loop control of\ndc-dc converter is achieved with an outer MV dc bus voltage\ncontrol loop and inner current control loop. The advantage\nof the scheme is that the control of MV dc link remains\nunaffected with the change in operational modes of the MV\nrectiﬁer. The output of this controller is phase shift angle φ\nand is shown in Fig. 5.\n3) Operation of the Inverter: The dc-ac inverter maintains\na balanced sinusoidal voltage with a constant frequency at\nthe LV distribution system throughout the operation. For\nsimplicity of the operation, the reference sinusoidal voltage is\ncomputed based on the PLL used for the MV rectiﬁer circuit.\nThe reference LV terminal voltage of the inverter is maintained\nat a constant value of 230 V rms per phase. Therefore, the\nreference inverter terminal voltages are given as follows:\nv∗\nlva = 230\n√\n2 ×sin(ωt)\nv∗\nlvb = 230\n√\n2 ×sin(ωt−1200)\nv∗\nlvc = 230\n√\n2 ×sin(ωt+ 1200).\n(4)\nB. Islanding Operation of the DMG System\n1) Operation of the Rectiﬁer: In a power system, the loads\nneed to be disconnected from the MV grid either in condition\nof grid fault or due to scheduled maintenance in transmission\nsystem. Once the islanding is detected due to the variations\nin the voltage outside the limit indicated in the grid code,\nthe part of the power distribution system that needs to be\nprotected by supplying the continuous power is disconnected\nfrom the supply mains using the STS and the DMG operation\nof ST is activated. Moreover, at the same time with the help\nof effective communication between the different feeders and\navailable RES and storage, the intelligent load shedding can\nbe done.\nDuring the islanding operation of proposed DMG system,\nthe operational mode of MV rectiﬁer must be changed from\nthe current control mode to voltage control mode. For the con-\ntinuous and reliable operation of the critical loads connected\nto the other feeder, it is essential to maintain a constant voltage\nat the MV point. In VCM operation of the MV rectiﬁer, the\nmagnitude of reference voltage at the MV terminal is set to\nvtabc abc\ndq0\nvd\nvq\nMAF PI 1/s\nθω ,\nFig. 4.

Therefore, the\nreference PCC voltages are\nv∗\nmva = 6350\n√\n2 ×sin(ωt)\nv∗\nmvb = 6350\n√\n2 ×sin(ωt−1200)\nv∗\nmvc = 6350\n√\n2 ×sin(ωt+ 1200).\n(5)\n2) Operation of the dc-dc Converter and the Inverter:\nDuring the islanding operation of the proposed ST based DMG\nsystem, the operation of dc-dc converter and dc-ac inverter is\nsimilar as that of the grid connected operation.\nIV. P ERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF ST BASED DMG\nSYSTEM\nFor evaluating the performance of the proposed ST based\nDMG system, the model shown in Fig. 1 is simulated in\nPSCAD software. The parameters of the system are given in\nTable I. The analysis is done under three operating conditions\nnamely grid connected mode, islanding mode of operation,\nand transition from grid connected mode to islanding mode\noperation. Also, for testing the features of the proposed\nscheme, it is considered that the sufﬁcient RES and storage\nis available at the dc link to support the total load demand\nduring the islanding operation of the DMG based ST.\nTABLE I\nSIMULATION PARAMETERS\nSystem quantities Values\nSource rms voltage 11 kV line-line, 50 Hz\nSource impedance Zs = 0.1 + j 3.14 Ω\nFeeder 1 loads Unbalanced nonlinear load\nFeeder 2 loads Unbalanced nonlinear load\nFeeder 3 Unbalanced nonlinear load\nNonlinear loads Diode bridge rectiﬁer loads\nLinear loads single and three phase RL loads\nRectiﬁer parameters Vdch = 15 kV , Lfh = 100 mH,\nCdch = 4000 µF, Rfh = 1 Ω\nCshh = 0.1 µF, Rshh = 5 Ω\nInverter parameters Vdcl = 600 V , Lfl = 5 mH,\nCdcl = 2000 µF, Rfl = 0.2 Ω\nCshl = 20 µF, Rshl = 5 Ω\n \n-10\n0\n10\n-40 \n0\n \n40 \n-80 \n0\n \n80 \n-40 \n-20 \n0\n \n40 \n0.66 0.68 0.7 0.72\n-400 \n0\n \n400 \n-400 \n0\n400 \nt (s)\nVoltage (kV)Current (A)Current (A)Voltage (V) Current (A)Current (A)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFig. 6.

Steady State Grid Connected Operation\nIn this case, it is shown that the ST based DMG supplies\navailable real power at the dc link into the MV grid, supplies\nloads connected at the LV side of the feeder 1, and additionally\ncompensates for the reactive and harmonic components of\ncurrents drawn by the feeders 2 and 3. The steady state\nperformance of the considered system is shown in the Fig. 6.\nThe ﬁgure shows three phase MV PCC voltages, MV side grid\ncurrents, rectiﬁer currents, total currents in feeders 1 and 2,\nand LV side voltages and currents of the feeder 1 containing\nST. It can be seen that the total grid currents are balanced\nand sinusoidal eventhough the currents in feeders 2 and 3 are\nunbalanced and distorted. The reason is that the ST supplies\nthe reactive and harmonic parts of currents drawn by other\nfeeders to achieve these advantages. Also, grid currents are\nin phase opposition to the PCC voltages as the ST supplies\n0.92\n-10\n0\n10\n-50 \n0\n \n50 \n-40 \n0\n \n40 \n-400 \n0\n \n400 \n-400 \n0\n \n400 \n-40 \n0\n \n40 \n0.94 0.96 0.98t (s)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n Voltage (kV)Current (A)Current (A)Voltage (V) Current (A)Current (A)\nFig. 7.

Islanding Operation of DMG\nIn this situation, both the rectiﬁer and the inverter of\nthe ST operates in voltage control mode and maintains a\nconstant balanced sinusoidal voltage at the MV and LV sides,\nrespectively. The corresponding waveforms for this mode of\noperation are given in Fig. 7. The rectiﬁer is operating in VCM\nand maintains a voltage of 11 kV line-line at PCC.

Also, the loads connected to the feeders 2\nand 3 remain operational even though those feeders does have\nnecessary mean to sustain. Moreover, the inverter operation\nremains unchanged from the case when the ST was operating\nin grid connected mode. It continues to maintain a constant\nsinusoidal voltage at the LV side and load draws the current\naccording to its requirements.\nC. Transition from Grid Connected to Islanding Mode of\nOperation\nThis case aims to demonstrate the performance of the ST\nbased DMG during transient operation and the corresponding\nwaveforms are shown in Fig. 8. Before the islanding operation,\nthe system is operating in grid connected mode and the\nperformance is the same as that of the Fig. 6. The ST\nsupplies real power available at the dc bus and provides load\ncompensation to feeders 2 and 3. At the time t = 0.9 s, a\ndisturbance is created in the MV supply voltage. The control\nscheme detects a disturbance and the switch STS is opened.\nSubsequently, the control of the MV rectiﬁer is changed\nfrom current control mode to voltage control mode operation.\nAfter the initial transients, a balanced sinusoidal voltage is\nmaintained at the MV terminals and the loads connected at\nthe feeders 2 and 3 are supplied by the ST. Again, the loads\nconnected at the LV side of the ST are continuously supplied.\nThe results indicate that the proposed ST based DMG can\nensure continuous operation of the loads connected to the other\nfeeders in addition to the loads connected to its own feeder.\nV. C ONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has proposed an ST based DMG operation in\na power distribution system. In normal operation, the ST\nsupplies available real power at the dc bus into the MV\ngrid. Additionally, it provides load compensation at the MV\nside. During the voltage disturbances, the ST maintains a\nbalanced sinusoidal voltage at the MV side and protects the\nsensitive loads connected to the other feeders, in addition\nto taking care of the loads connected to its own feeder.\nThese advantages of the proposed DMG operation signiﬁcantly\nimprove the utilization of the ST in a power distribution\nsystem. Simulation results presented using PSCAD software\nvalidate the advantages of the proposed concept.\nVI.
