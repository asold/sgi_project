Handler\nFemale to male sex reversal was achieved in an emerging agricultural insect pest, Drosophila suzukii, \nby creating a temperature-sensitive point mutation in the sex-determination gene, transformer-2 \n(tra-2), using CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) \nhomology-directed repair gene-editing. Ds-tra-2ts2 mutants developed as normal fertile XX and XY \nadults at permissive temperatures below 20 °C, but at higher restrictive temperatures (26 to 29 °C) \nchromosomal XX females developed as sterile intersexuals with a predominant male phenotype, while \nXY males developed with normal morphology, but were sterile. The temperature-dependent function \nof the Ds-TRA-2ts2 protein was also evident by the up- and down-regulation of female-specific Ds-Yolk \nprotein 1 (Ds-Yp1) gene expression by temperature shifts during adulthood. This study confirmed \nthe temperature-dependent function of a gene-edited mutation and provides a new method for \nthe more general creation of conditional mutations for functional genomic analysis in insects, and \nother organisms. Furthermore, it provides a temperature-dependent system for creating sterile \nmale populations useful for enhancing the efficacy of biologically-based programs, such as the sterile \ninsect technique (SIT), to control D. suzukii and other insect pest species of agricultural and medical \nimportance.\nThe role of the transformer-2 (tra-2) sex determination gene in Drosophila melanogaster, and the temporal spec-\nificity of the hierarchal sex-determination gene pathway was elucidated in part by the selection of two tra-2  \ntemperature-sensitive mutant alleles induced by chemical mutagenesis, which allowed its function and down-\nstream effects to be controlled by ambient temperature\n1,2. Two missense point mutations, resulting in Ala151Val \n(GCC > GTC) for tra-2ts1 and Pro181Ser (CCA > TCA) for tra-2ts2, apparently result in temperature-labile con-\nformational changes in the polypeptide at the elevated temperature of 29 °C that eliminate function, while normal \nfunction is maintained at 16 °C. The importance of these amino acids is also reflected in their conservation in tra-\n2 cognates found in other drosophilids, tephritids, a lepidopteran and two hymenopteran species3, that include \nthe Ala161 and Pro191 peptides in the spotted winged drosophila, D. suzukii4.\nNotably, the ability to manipulate TRA-2 protein function during development provided the initial insight \nthat its function, and thus, that of the sex-determination gene hierarchy, was required continuously for somatic \nfemale-specific differentiation, and in the transient absence of TRA-2, the default state of male differentia-\ntion would result\n1,2. The notion that this sex-specific control extended past metamorphosis, and was required \nthroughout adulthood after completion of morphological differentiation, was supported by experiments using \nfemale-specific yolk protein (Yp) gene expression as a sex-specific biochemical and molecular marker during \nadulthood. By subjecting XX; tra-2\nts flies to shifts in ambient temperature it was discovered that Yp gene expres-\nsion and protein synthesis could be diminished at 29 °C and re-initiated when shifted back to 16 °C. This showed \nthat tra-2 function acted continuously in adult females to maintain Yp synthesis, and thus, female-specific pro-\ncesses throughout adulthood5.\nIn addition to the fundamental knowledge of how sex-determination genes control sex-specific development \nand behavior, the tra-2ts2 studies, in particular, also presented an ideal strategy for generating a sterile male pop-\nulation that could be of use to the sterile insect technique (SIT) 6, a highly effective biologically-based means of \nUSDA/ARS, Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology, 1700 SW 23rd Drive, Gainesville, FL, 32608, \nUSA.

A cornerstone of SIT is the mass release of \nsterile males that, in sufficient numbers, outcompete wild males in the field for female mating thereby rendering \nthem non-reproductive. Limitations to these programs has generally been the need for sexing in early develop-\nment to eliminate the high cost of rearing females and the need to sterilize and release them with males in the \nabsence of sexing, and the debilitating somatic effects of irradiation used for sterilization\n10.\nThe tra-2ts2 mutation effectively addresses both of these limitations as demonstrated in D. melanogaster, where \nhomozygous male and female tra-2ts2 mutants reared at 16 °C develop normally and are fertile, but when reared at \n29 °C, chromosomal XX females develop as sterile phenotypic (or pseudo) males that exhibit courtship behavior \n(observed in XX; tra-2ts1/tra-2def)11. XY chromosomal males develop normally at the restrictive temperature, but \nare sterile due to requisite TRA-2 function in the germ-line 12,13. Thus, a tra-2ts2 mutant strain could provide a \nnormal breeding population at the permissive temperature, whose progeny reared at the restrictive temperature \nwould all develop as sterile males for release. Two important benefits of this strategy are that: i) no other treatment \nother than elevated temperature would be required for both sexing and male sterility in drosophilid pests, such \nas D. suzukii (though other non-drosophilid species may require an independent sterility system for XY; tra-2\nts2 \nmales), and ii) a smaller breeding population may be sufficient to generate the same number of phenotypic sterile \nmales required for release, substantially increasing efficiency and cost effectiveness.\nThe ability to incorporate this strategy into insect pest species having an orthologous tra-2 gene, however, has \nbeen hindered by the need to generate the same mutation for a mass reared strain in the absence of the genetic \ntools available for D. melanogaster, including visible selectable markers and balancer chromosomes. Germ-line \ntransformation could be used to introduce an in vitro  mutagenized tra-2\nts allele, though targeted mutagenesis \nwould be required to eliminate function of the native wild type alleles that would complement the mutant loss \nof function. These restrictions can be largely overcome by gene-editing techniques that allow a gene conversion \nor replacement of the native wild type tra-2 allele for a mutated tra-2\nts allele, in conjunction with incorporating \na dominant fluorescent protein visible marker for ease of selection and rearing14. To demonstrate the feasibility \nof this approach in an insect pest species, we have created the Ds-tra-2 ts2 mutation by CRISPR/Cas9 editing in \nthe spotted wing drosophila, D. suzukii. While this species is not an ideal subject for tra-2 ts-based sex-reversal, \nsince it is not highly viable at optimal restrictive temperatures 15, temperature-dependent phenotypes of mor -\nphological and biochemical sex reversal, and male and female sterility were demonstrated. Thus, this model for \ntemperature-dependent sex reversal and sterility provides proof of concept for further testing in other species \nsubject to control by SIT, and as a method for generating conditional alleles for functional genomic analysis in \nnon-model species.\nResults\nCreation of the Ds-tra-2ts2 mutation. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was performed using a homology-di-\nrected repair (HDR) strategy (Fig. 1a). Two sgRNAs were used as scissors, and a donor construct provided a tem-\nplate including the putative Ds-tra-2ts2 point mutation, the IE1hr5-DsRed marker gene, and two homologous arms \nupstream and downstream of the cutting site (~1 kb each). One sgRNA targeted Ds-tra-2 at a position 449 bp 5′ \nupstream of the mutation site and the other targeted the proximal downstream sequence to Ds-tra-2, predicted to \nFigure 1.

To bias edit-\ning towards HDR, the ligase 4 gene, a component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, was \nsuppressed using dsRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi). A mixture of sgRNAs, Cas9 protein, Ds-ligase-4  \ndsRNA and donor construct was injected into pre-blastoderm embryos of a D. suzukii wild strain, yielding 81 G0 \nadult flies (36 males and 45 females). Of these, 55 flies were fertile after individual backcrosses to wild type, with \nfour G0 lines yielding G1 progeny expressing whole body red fluorescence, resulting in a germ-line transmission \nrate of 7.3% (4/55) based on marker expression. From each G0 line, two to five red fluorescent G1 flies (Fig. 1c) \nwere selected to establish independent G1 lines. After being inbred to homozygosity, six lines were analyzed by \nPCR and sequencing showing that all lines had an insertion of the IE1hr5-DsRed marker gene, however, only \nthree lines (F26m1, F26f4 and M36f1, from two G0 lines) carried the correct Ds-tra-2\nts2 (CCT > TCT) mutation \nwhile the other three lines could not be confirmed, resulting in a minimum mutation rate of 3.6% (2/55).\nTemperature sensitivity of Ds-TRA-2 protein function based on adult morphology and fertility.  \nTo determine the effect of temperature on the mutated Ds-TRA-2 protein in terms of morphological sexual dif-\nferentiation in chromosomal females and males, the homozygous mutant line, M36f1, was first reared continu-\nously at the expected permissive temperature of 16 °C, in addition to 20 °C. This resulted in normal development \nand fertility in all XX females and XY males at both temperatures (Fig. 1b; Table 1). However, when rearing was \nperformed at the expected restrictive temperature of 29 °C, all mutants died during late pupation, as did wild \ntype control flies. Rearing at 27 °C and 28 °C also resulted in inviability for the mutant line and a low survival \nrate for wild type (1–2%), with low levels of survival (5–10%) for both wild type and mutant flies first observed \nat 26 °C. At this temperature 80 surviving chromosomal female XX; Ds-tra-2\nts2 homozygotes exhibited an inter-\nsexual, though predominantly male (or pseudo-male), phenotype (Fig.  2c and f), but male-specific wing spots \nwere not apparent (Fig. 2c). However, in a separate experiment where XX; Ds-tra-2ts2 individuals (n = 21), were \nreared at 22 °C and shifted to 29 °C as late pupae, wing spot pigmentation was observed at 3 days after eclosion \n(Fig. 2c inset; Supplementary Table S1). Compared to mature ovaries from WT females (Fig. 2i), XX; Ds-tra-2ts2 \npseudo-males had a single poorly differentiated gonadal lobe (Fig. 2j) and no internal male reproductive organs, \nsimilar to XX; Dm-tra-2ts2 flies reared at 29 °C1. At 26 °C pseudo-males were also sterile with fully differentiated \nmale-specific foreleg sex combs (Fig.  3c) and male-specific pigmentation on tergite 6 (Fig.  3f), while tergite 5 \nlacked male-specific pigmentation and female-specific tergite 7 was observed. The differing sexual identity of the \nabdominal tergites, as well as other sex-specific tissues and structures, can most simply be attributed to a vari-\nable sensitivity to Ds-TRA-2 function that was diminished in pseudo-males reared at a sub-optimal restrictive \ntemperature.\nA detailed examination of the external genitalia revealed that pseudo-males exhibited terminalia similar \nto WT males (Fig.  4), including the anterior paramere (clasper), posterior paramere, aedeagus and anal plates \n(Fig. 4c). However, the basal apodeme of the aedeagus was not apparent (Fig. 4a) and the female-specific sternite \n8 was observed, while the female-specific spermatheca was not observed. At 26 °C, XY; Ds-tra-2\nts2 chromosomal \nmales had normal external morphology, but were sterile consistent with poorly differentiated abnormal testes that \nhad a small number of immotile sperm (n  = 15, Fig. 2h, Supplementary Video S1), compared to the long spiral \ntestes containing motile sperm found in WT males (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Video S2).\nTo more precisely determine the temperature sensitivity of Ds-TRA-2 function in the mutant line, adult mor-\nphology and fertility were assessed in XY and XX; Ds-tra-2\nts2 adults that developed at rearing temperatures rang-\ning from 16 °C to 26 °C (Table 1). As noted, at the permissive temperatures of 16–20 °C both XX females and \nXY males were morphologically normal (Fig.  1b) and fertile, but at 22 °C XX females first exhibited male sex \ncombs and were sterile based on a failure to oviposit (n  = 61), while WT females oviposited ≥ 78 fertile eggs/\nfemale (n ≥ 39) when reared at 20–24 °C (Table 1). Increased levels of male morphology occurred with increasing \ntemperature, with nearly complete male morphology at 26 °C.

These results \nare consistent with Ds-TRA-2 function, or the quantity of functional protein, diminishing just above permissive \ntemperature, with an increasing loss of Ds-TRA-2 activity with rising temperature. The sex-specificity of somatic \ntissue and germ-line function appeared to be more highly sensitive to loss of Ds-TRA-2 activity in XX females \n(i.e., onset of sex comb differentiation and sterility) than the influence on testis morphology and germ-line func-\ntion (i.e., fertility) in XY males where the onset of defects were first detected at a higher temperature.\nComplete sterility in XY; Ds-tra-2\nts2 males could be achieved by rearing at 25.5 °C or above, but viability at \nthese temperatures was severely limited. Thus, XY; Ds-tra-2ts2 males were reared at 22 °C until pharate adulthood \nor adult eclosion resulting in viability of 80 to 90%, and shifted to 26 °C and/or 29 °C to determine if these late \nshifts to restrictive temperature would result in sterility (Supplementary Table S1). Sterility was achieved in 90 to \n100% of the males, with greater sterility in those that were shifted earlier and to the higher temperature, although \nthis resulted in lower viability.\nMating behavior of mutant intersexes and pseudo-males.  In D. melanogaster, temperature sensi-\ntive male courtship behavior and mating in XX individuals required a nearly null Dm-tra-2 genotype that used \nthe stronger Dm-tra-2\nts1 allele over a Dm-tra-2 deficiency 11. For XX; Ds-tra-2 ts2 pseudo-males, flies reared \nat 26 °C (n = 20), and shifted to 29 °C for 3d at eclosion from 26 °C (n = 15) or as late pupae (n  = 23) did not \nattempt courtship or mating with wild type virgin females, while XY; Ds-tra-2 ts2 males reared at 26 °C (n = 22) \ndid mate, but were sterile. At 22 °C, XX; Ds-tra-2 ts2 females developed female genital terminalia and did not \nattempt courtship with WT virgin females (n  = 29), but were courted by WT and XY; Ds-tra-2 ts2 males who \nwere rejected (n = 20).\nTemperature sensitivity of Ds-TRA-2 function based on terminal sex-specific Yp1 expression \nduring adulthood.

For D. suzukii in particular, the ability of adults to survive at 29 °C, after \nrearing at 26 °C or below, also allowed a more definitive test of the optimal restrictive temperature on Ds-TRA-2ts2  \nprotein function. This was achieved by assessing the effect of temperature and temperature shifts on the sex \nspecific expression of the D. suzukii yolk protein 1 (Ds-Yp1) gene in Ds-tra-2\nts2 mutants that, in D. melanogaster, \nis normally expressed only in female adult fat body and the ovarian follicular epithelium beginning at adult \neclosion\n16,17.\nFigure 3.

For experimental tests, Ds-Yp1 transcripts were measured in XX; Ds-tra-2ts2 (M36f1) phenotypic females \nand WT females reared and then maintained at 16 °C until 3 d, 6 d, and 9 d after eclosion (Fig. 5a; Supplementary \nTable S2). Transcript levels were not significantly different between the mutant and WT females at these time \npoints, though transcript increased between days 3 and 6, and then decreased in both WT and XX; Ds-tra-2 ts2 \nfemales by day 9, though more so in M36f1 females (P  > 0.05, two-tailed, no significant difference at all time \npoints; Supplementary Table S2). In contrast, when mutant and WT females reared at 16 °C were shifted to 29 °C \nat eclosion, after 3 days WT females expressed > 27-fold higher levels of Ds-Yp1 transcript compared to XX; \nDs-tra-2ts2 females (Fig.  5b). Decreasing levels of transcript occurred in both groups at 6 d and 9 d, with neg-\nligible transcript detected in mutant females after 9 d at 29  °C. To determine whether the basal transcript level \nobserved in mutant females at 29 °C for 3 days could be reversed to a more normal female phenotype by turning \non Ds-TRA-2 function, sibling flies were shifted to 16 °C at 3 d and assayed at days 6 and 9 after eclosion (Fig. 5c). \nAt 6 d the Ds-Yp1 transcript level in WT females decreased ~40% (presumably due to a slowed metabolism), \nbut increased ~9-fold in XX; Ds-tra-2ts2 females, with similar levels maintained in both groups at 9 d (P  > 0.05, \ntwo-tailed). However, if females at 6 d at 16 °C were shifted to 29 °C until 9 d, transcript levels decreased by half \nin WT females, but were barely detectable in the XX; Ds-tra-2 ts2 females, decreasing by > 40-fold from day 6 \n(P < 0.05, two-tailed; Fig. 5d).\nThese results showed that adult XX; Ds-tra-2 ts2 phenotypic females reared at 16  °C exhibit normal female \nexpression of Ds-Yp1, but when sibling females were shifted from 16 °C to 29 °C, low diminished transcript levels \nresulted reaching non-detectable levels, normally expected in XY males, by day 9. Furthermore, Ds-Yp1 tran -\nscript levels increased and decreased according to shifts in temperature to permissive and restrictive conditions, \nrespectively, indicating that the dynamic, and reversible, expression of Ds-Yp1 during adulthood is continuously \nFigure 5.

Presumably this function is mediated by the more direct effect of Ds-TRA/\nDs-TRA-2 interactions on the female-specific expression of Ds-dsx (GenBank: XM_017077018.1) 4, as demon-\nstrated in D. melanogaster20.\nDiscussion\nHere we report the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in D. suzukii to create a conditional temperature sensitive \nallele of the tra-2 sex determination gene, Ds-tra-2\nts2, analogous to the chemically induced Dm-tra-2ts2 missense \npoint mutation in D. melanogaster1. This was achieved by comparing amino acid sequence identity for TRA-2 in \nboth species (Supplementary Fig. S3), and identifying the common peptides that are substituted in Dm -tra-2ts1 \nand Dm-tra-2ts2 1,18. Since Dm-tra-2ts2 was shown to exhibit better fertility than Dm-tra-2ts1 at permissive temper-\natures1,18, its mutation site was the initial choice for editing in D. suzukii for this study, though the tra-2ts1 allele \nmight also present advantages for application, or additional insights into function.\nSimilar to Dm-tra-2ts2, XX chromosomal females homozygous for Ds-tra-2ts2 reared at permissive tempera-\ntures of 16–20 °C resulted in development of normal fertile females, while rearing at a restrictive temperature of \n26 °C resulted in a sterile, though incomplete pseudo-male phenotype. The lack of full male phenotypic differ -\nentiation, unlike XX; Dm-tra-2ts2 pseudo-males reared at 29 °C, was most likely the result of rearing D. suzukii at \na lower sub-optimal restrictive temperature, since this species fails to complete pupal development when reared \nabove 26 °C. Thus, complete loss of Ds-TRA-2 function at 26 °C was unlikely, though distinct male morpholog-\nical differentiation was apparent based on complete foreleg sex comb development, posterior dorsal tergite 6 \npigmentation, and wing spot pigmentation when shifted to 29 °C in early adulthood. The genital apparatus struc-\ntures were intersexual, but predominantly male-like, and similar to XX; Dm-tra-2\nts2 pseudo-males, the gonads \nof XX; Ds-tra-2ts2 pseudo-males were dysmorphic, possibly intersexual, and did not produce motile sperm 1,19. \nConversely, XY; Ds-tra-2ts2 males reared at 26 °C exhibited normal male external morphology and mated, but were \nalso sterile with dysmorphic testes consistent with the tra-2 null phenotype in D. melanogaster that is known to \ninterfere with male germ-line development\n12,13. A notable difference between the tra-2ts2 lines in the two species \nis that Dm-tra-2ts2 XX females and XY males were highly sensitive to loss of Dm-TRA-2 activity, becoming sterile \nat 18 °C18, while Ds-tra-2ts2 XX and XY individuals exhibited less sensitivity, becoming sterile at 22 °C and 26 °C, \nrespectively.\nWhile D. suzukii could not develop past late pupation at 29 °C, surviving adults at 26 °C or below could be \nreared at 29 °C, allowing the sex-specificity of downstream transcriptional products in adults to be assessed in \nresponse to Ds-TRA-2ts2 function at the optimal restrictive temperature. This allowed a more accurate compar-\nison of TRA-2 function in D. suzukii  and D. melanogaster and its downstream regulation of sexual differenti-\nation. In D. melanogaster, functional TRA-2 acts in concert with the transformer  gene product to facilitate the \nfemale-mode of doublesex alternative intron-splicing, resulting in DSX-Female function throughout adulthood20. \nThe continuous need for control by the sex-determination gene pathway throughout female development was, \nindeed, first inferred by experiments with Dm-tra-2\nts2 that showed that female-specific Yp transcription and syn-\nthesis in adults could be up- and down-regulated by manipulating temperature-dependent Dm-TRA-2 function5. \nFor Ds-TRA-2ts2, we showed that Yp gene expression could be similarly regulated by temperature such that XX; \nDs-tra-2ts2 pseudo-males reared at 16 °C and shifted to 29 °C at adult eclosion exhibited basal Yp1 transcription \nlevels, that could be transiently up-regulated to levels comparable to WT females after a shift to 16 °C, and subse-\nquently down-regulated to basal levels by a shift to 29 °C. Together, these studies confirmed the expressivity and \ntemperature-dependent conditional function of the gene-edited Ds-tra-2ts2 mutation that also provided support \nfor the continuous, and reversible, requirement for Ds-TRA-2 in both females and males for adult sexual differ-\nentiation and fertility throughout development.\nBeyond providing a conditional system to better understand how sex-determination genes control sexual \ndifferentiation and behavior, the Drosophila tra-2ts studies also present a highly efficient strategy for generating \na sterile male population for SIT6. For this, a tra-2ts mutant strain reared at permissive temperature would result \nin a normal breeding population of fertile males and females, whose chromosomal male and female progeny all \ndevelop as sterile phenotypic males at the restrictive temperature. Thus, ideally, a tra-2\nts mutant strain could pro-\nvide a complete sterile male population in response to a shift in temperature, and provide the significant efficiency \nof all zygotes being used for release, requiring a considerably smaller breeding population.\nCurrent control of D. suzukii does not include SIT\n21, and the temperature-sensitive sexing system described \nis less than optimal for this species due to post-larval inviability at 29 °C required for complete XX female sex \nreversal. However, XY; Ds-tra-2ts2 males are sterile but sexually active at ambient temperatures above 25 °C, and \ncould be reared at lower temperatures for improved viability, yet sterilized when shifted to higher restrictive tem-\nperatures as pharate adults. These sterile males could directly compete with wild males in the field, though the \nability of their sibling XX; Ds-tra-2\nts2 pseudo-males to provide mating competition remains uncertain. Regardless \nof their ability to mate with females in the field, chromosomal females that develop as phenotypic males or inter-\nsexuals would still preclude the need to eliminate or sterilize these individuals before release, unlike normal \nfemales, since they would not require sterilization, nor compete with females in the field for mating with released \nsterile males, or cause oviposition damage to host plants. Thus, the programmatic and cost advantages of Ds-tra-\n2\nts2-based sexing and sterility might still provide a level of efficiency that would support its incorporation into \nprospective SIT programs for D. suzukii. Nevertheless, the fertility and mating behavior of both XX and XY \nmutant adults would require further testing to ensure the efficacy of this system in response to temperature fluc-\ntuations under actual field conditions.\nThis demonstration of temperature-dependent sex reversal established by gene-editing in D. suzukii also sup-\nports the notion that this could be accomplished in other insect species having conserved tra-2 cognate function \nand sequence identity. This is especially so for several tephritid fruit fly species, such as Ceratitis capitata (medfly), \nAnastrepha ludens (mexfly), and A. suspensa (caribfly), which have conserved sites for the TRA-2 Alanine and \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n8\nScientific  RepoRts  | 7: 12363  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-12405-4\nProline peptides substituted in the tra-2 ts1 and tra-2ts2 mutations, respectively 3,22. Importantly, sex reversal of \nchromosomal females by RNAi-based knock-down of the tra and tra-2 cognates, resulting in XX pseudo-males \nthat copulate with wild females, has already been demonstrated for medfly and caribfly 22,23. Given that these \ntropical insects thrive at ambient temperatures of 29 °C or above, it is likely that full male differentiation could \nbe achieved in XX; tra-2ts individuals with the potential for successful mating with females in the field. However, \nthe RNAi studies also showed that while tra-2 knock-down in XX caribflies resulted in sterile pseudo-males, XY \nmales remained fertile, and in medfly both XX pseudo-males and XY males remained fertile. Thus, for tephritid \nspecies tra-2\nts males reared at restrictive temperatures might remain fertile, requiring an independent conditional \nsystem for male sterility, such as the tetracycline-dependent embryonic lethality system described for medfly and \ncaribfly\n24,25.\nIn summary, proof of principle has been demonstrated in D. suzukii for the creation of a conditional \ntemperature-sensitive allele by gene-editing that most likely can be extended to other temperature-sensitive mis-\nsense mutations, and in a wide range of species known to have an orthologous gene\n26. That a very broad range \nof genes can be edited in this way in insects is supported by D. melanogaster mutational studies that showed that \ngreater than 10% of X-linked lethal and semi-lethal mutations are temperature-sensitive\n27. For the tra-2 gene in \nparticular, that is conserved among several orders of insects, synthetic creation of temperature-sensitive muta-\ntions has significant potential for detailed comparative functional analyses and, for pest species, enhancing the \nefficacy of programs to control their population size. While this and other possible applications remain prospec-\ntive, the ability to create conditional alleles in a large number of genes known to be important to many aspects \nof reproduction, development and behavior should have a highly significant impact on our understanding of \ngenome function and evolution.\nMethods\nAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article (and its Supplementary \nInformation files). All sequence files are available from the GenBank database (accession numbers MF142759, \nMF142760, MF142761 and MF142762) after publishing of this work.\nFly rearing, fertility and mating tests. A wild type strain of D. suzukii originally collected in Wimauma, \nFlorida, was reared under standard laboratory conditions as described 28. Gene-edited transgenic homozygous \nflies were reared at 16 °C ± 0.2 °C (EchoTherm™IN40 incubator, Torrey Pines Scientific, Inc.), and tested at indi-\ncated temperatures ( ± 0.2 °C) for temperature sensitivity after 24 h and 48 h of egg collection at 16 °C. Fertility \ntests were performed by mating each mutant male to five wild type virgin females (n  ≥ 15) and each mutant \nfemale to three WT males (n ≥ 20) followed by egg collections for 12–15 days. Progeny were reared to adulthood \nand screened for red fluorescence. Mating tests were performed by combining previously unmated 3 d adult flies \nfor observation of courtship behavior including body orientation, wing vibration, licking and copulation for 6 h \nat mid-day (1000–1600), and for 4 h beginning at dawn (approx. 0700) of the following day.\nMutation generation via CRISPR/Cas9.  The Ds-tra-2  gene was identified by a Blast search using \nDm-tra-2 mRNA (GenBank: NM_057416.3) as a query, and was identified in contig1010 from the D. suzukii  \ngenome (GenBank: XM_017071951)4. The putative Ds-tra-2ts2 mutation site was localized to nt 571 in the CDS \n(GenBank: MF142759) based on alignment with the Dm-tra-2 ts2 amino acid sequence 1,18, and confirmed with \nprimers AH1001/AH1002 by RT-PCR and sequencing. Oligonucleotide primers were designed with Geneious® \n8.0.5 (Biomatters Ltd.) software and listed in Supplementary Table S3 with annealing conditions. sgRNA targets \nwere identified by a manual search for NGG proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. Two targets were \nidentified having high GC content within the six PAM-proximal nucleotides (PAMPNs)29 and less similarity to \nother genomic sequences to improve efficiency and avoid off-target effects. sgRNAs were synthesized as previ-\nously described\n30 using primers AH992, AH1053 and AH1054 (Supplementary Table S3). Their specificities were \nconfirmed by embryonic injections and Surveyor tests (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nTo create the donor construct, a 3.6 kb fragment from D. suzukii genomic DNA was cloned using Q5 ® \nHigh-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with primers AH1020/AH1021, which included two \nhomologous arms of more than 1 kb upstream and downstream from the two sgRNA target sites. The Ds-tra-\n2\nts2 point mutation was introduced by primers AH1027/AH1028. To avoid cleavage of the donor construct and \nmutagenesis after integration by CRISPR/Cas9, two single-nucleotide synonymous substitutions (G > C for \nsgRNA1 site; G > A for sgRNA2 site) were introduced into the two sgRNA target site PAM sequences, respec-\ntively, since an intact PAM sequence is necessary for successful double strand breakage 31. Homologous arm 1 \n(HA1) was assembled using the GeneArt® Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from \nthree fragments, which were amplified with primer pairs AH1026/AH1027, AH1028/AH1029, and AH1030/\nAH1031. HA2 was assembled from two fragments amplified with primer pairs AH1032/AH1033 and AH1034/\nAH1035 with the Ds-tra-2\nts2 mutation and PAM substitutions confirmed by sequencing. Next, a fragment con-\ntaining the IE1hr5-DsRed/SV40 marker gene was amplified from the piggyBac  transformation vector plasmid, \npB{IE1hr5-DsRed/SV40} with primers AH1044/AH1045, and the complete HA1 and HA2 fragments were ampli-\nfied using primer pairs AH1026/AH1043 and AH1035/AH1046. The DsRed marker, HA1 and HA2 were then \nassembled with the GeneArt\n® Kit and confirmed by sequencing.\nThe D. suzukii Ds-ligase4 gene (GenBank: XM_017079597) 4 was identified by Blastn alignment similarity \nto Dm-ligase4 from D. melanogaster (GenBank: NM_132679.3; protein alignment of the conceptual transla-\ntion of these sequences shown in Supplementary Fig. S4). The online SnapDragon tool (http://www.flyrnai.org/\nsnapdragon) was used to design a 421 bp dsRNA fragment whose sequence was confirmed after PCR amplifi-\ncation with primers AH1003/AH1004 (GenBank: MF142760). The dsRNA was then synthesized as described \npreviously22,32.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n9\nScientific  RepoRts  | 7: 12363  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-12405-4\nEmbryo micro-injection. Pre-blastoderm embryos were injected with a mixture of 400 ng/µl Cas9 protein \n(PNA Bio Inc), 75 ng/µl sgRNA1, 75 ng/µl sgRNA2, 100 ng/µl donor plasmid and 350 ng/µl Ds-ligase4 dsRNA \nusing D. suzukii germ-line transformation injection methods 28. Putative G1 transformant adults were selected \nby DsRed epifluorescence (TxRed filter: ex: 560/40; em: 610 LP; Chroma) that were backcrossed to wild type \nwith G2 homozygous lines established by successive inbreeding, selection by marker fluorescence intensity, and \nverification by outcrosses to wild type. Genomic DNA of homozygous flies was extracted with ZR Genomic \nDNA\n™-Tissue MicroPrep (Zymo Research) with the edited regions amplified with primer pairs AH1093/AH986 \nand AH987/AH1094 and sequenced for molecular confirmation.\nCuticle preparation. Flies were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with forelegs, abdom-\ninal and terminal cuticles incubated in 10% NaOH at 80 °C for 30 minutes to remove soft tissue, rinsed with PBS \nand mounted in Acrytol Mounting Media (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for imaging.\nReal-time qPCR. Total RNA was isolated with the ZR Tissue & Insect RNA MicroPrep ™ kit (Zymo \nResearch), followed by cDNA synthesis from 1 μg RNA using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The \nDs-Yp1 (GenBank: XM_017081211) and Ds-His3 (GenBank: XM_017082962) genes were identified by a Blastn \nsearch of the D. suzukii genome\n4 with their D. melanogaster cognates (GenBank: NM_078548.3 for Yp1 and \nFlybase: CG33866-RA for His3 ). Primer pairs AH1133/AH1134 and AH1135/AH1136 were used to amplify \ntheir partial CDS (GenBank: MF142761 for Ds-Yp1, and MF142762 for Ds-His3) whose sequence identities were \nverified by Blastx and ClustalW\n33 alignments (Supplementary Figs S1 and S5). Primers AH1139/AH1140 and \nAH1137/AH1138 were designed to compare the expression levels of Ds-Yp1 to the internal control Ds-His3 gene, \nrespectively, using a CFX96 Touch\n™ Real-Time time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). 100 ng cDNA was added \ninto iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The 2 −∆∆Ct method was used with three biological replicates for \neach sample at each time point34, with all data normalized to the relative Yp1/His3 expression of sample M36f1 at \n3 d–29 °C (mean = 0.2), and the Student t-test was performed to compare differences.\nReferences\n 1.
