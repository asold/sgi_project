    "abstract": "Abstract The design of low dielectric-loss epoxy resin (EP) systems plays an important role in the insulation optimization of medium-frequency transformers (MFTs). Due to the diversity of EP and curing agents, the traditional design method inspired by dielectric-loss measurements cannot complete low dielectric-loss EP systems design in plentiful candidate EP systems. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) computation was introduced to drive the design of a low dielectric-loss EP system for MFTs. By analyzing the relationship between the dielectric loss and molecular motion of the EP systems, two MD results were selected as descriptors to indicate the dielectric loss of EP systems, including mean square displacement and α -transition temperature. Eventually, the low dielectric-loss EP system blending EP, methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, and dodecenyl succinic anhydride was effectively designed according to the descriptors. The rationality of the computationally driven design was verified by broadband dielectric spectroscopy measurement and the finite element method. Compared with previous EP systems, MFT insulated with the designed EP system had not only a 40% lower dielectric loss (9.79 W) but a higher overload capacity. This study provides an effective method for the design of low dielectric-loss EP systems.",
