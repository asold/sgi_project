Typically, transformers oils have a low ther-\nmal conductivity, and therefore they exhibit rather poor cooling behavior. To improve\nremoval of heat generated by the large power transformers, mineral oils with suspended\nmagnetic nanoparticles can be used [ 1]. The decrease of the saturation magnetization\nwith temperature and the presence of a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the transformer\ncause the ferroﬂuid close to the winding to be less attracted in comparison to the fer-\nroﬂuid in the cooler region of the transformer. This additional convective ﬂow of the\nferroﬂuid under the inﬂuence of an ac magnetic ﬁeld enhances the ﬂuid circulation\nwithin the transformer windings and thus reduces their temperature. This can increase\nthe transformer capacity to withstand lightning impulses, while minimizing the effect\nof moisture in typical insulating ﬂuids [ 2].\nIn order to optimize the parameters of the transformer-oil-based ferroﬂuids, it is\nnecessary to study their physical, magnetic, and rheological characteristics. One of the\nmost important properties of magnetic colloidal dispersions is the particle (or aggre-\ngate) size distribution (PSD) which may inﬂuence their magnetic, rheological, thermal,\nand elastic properties. Among the methods commonly used to measure the PSD func-\ntion and study its properties are ultrasonic techniques which are recognized as very\npromising from an industrial point of view [ 3]. The usefulness of ultrasonic methods\nlies in their relative simplicity and non-invasive nature. Basically, the application of\nthese methods to study colloidal suspensions involves measuring the velocity and the\nattenuation of ultrasound as a function of particles concentration, temperature, and\nfrequency of the wave. In practice, to evaluate ultrasonic data within a framework of\nthe chosen theoretical model, it is necessary to determine a number of thermophysical\nproperties of both the phases.\nIn this article, the velocity and the attenuation of ultrasound in a transformer oil-\nbased magnetic ﬂuid were measured within a temperature range of 10\n◦Ct o8 0 ◦Cf o r\neight samples with different concentrations of the dispersed phase. Additionally, the\ndensity and viscosity of the studied samples were determined. Assuming a log-normal\nparticle size distribution (PSD), the parameters of the PSD were determined by ﬁtting\nthe expressions for viscous and thermal losses derived by Vinogradov and Isakovich\n[4] to the ultrasonic attenuation data.\n2 Materials and Methods\nFerroﬂuids composed of transformer oil ITO 100 (inhibited transformer oil) and Fe 3O4\nparticles coated with oleic acid were prepared at the Institute of Experimental Physics,\nSlovak Academy of Sciences in Košice. Magnetic particles were obtained by chem-\nical precipitation of ferrous and ferric salts in an alkali medium. From the magneti-\nzation curve obtained using the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) method, the\nvolume concentration of magnetite particles, φ\nm,1 = 6.6 %, and their mean diam-\neter, ⟨d⟩= 10.27 nm, were determined [ 5]. Samples with eight different volume\nconcentrations of magnetite particles have been prepared. The initial ferroﬂuid FF\nwas further diluted with transformer oil in the following proportions: FF:2 ( φ\nm,2 =\n3.3 %), FF:4 ( φm,3 = 1.65 %), FF:8 ( φm,4 = 0.82 %), FF:16 ( φm,5 = 0.41 %), FF:32\n(φm,6 = 0.2 %), FF:64 ( φm,7 =0.1 %), and FF:128 ( φm,8 = 0.05 %). This method of\n123\nInt J Thermophys (2011) 32:795–806 797\npreparation of the samples should not affect the particle size as these kinds of ferroﬂ-\nuids have been shown to be stable for long periods. In other words, the measured PSD\nshould be independent of the volume concentration of the sample.\nThe ultrasonic measurements were carried out using the ResoScan (Germany) ultra-\nsonic device which measures the ultrasonic velocity, c, and attenuation, α/f 2,o ft h e\nsample, where f is the frequency of the ultrasonic wave. The ResoScan system is based\non the resonance method [ 6]. A sample cell with a path length of 7.0 mm constitutes\nthe ultrasonic resonator in which a standing wave is set up. During the initialization, a\nfrequency range of 7 MHz to 9 MHz is scanned. From the resonance peaks, the ultra-\nsonic velocity and attenuation are calculated. The temperature control of the sample\nis provided by a Peltier thermostat which operates in the 5\n◦Ct o8 0 ◦C tempera-\nture range with an uncertainty of 10 mK. The resolution of the ultrasonic velocity is\n0.001 m · s−1, and the repeatability of the absolute velocity after automatic reinitial-\nization is ±0.01 m · s−1. The relative error of the ultrasonic attenuation coefﬁcient is\ncalculated from the series of repeated measurements and is better than 5 %.\nThe shear viscosity coefﬁcient was measured using a cone-and-plate Brookﬁeld\nDV II+ viscometer within the 15 ◦Ct o5 0 ◦C temperature range with a temperature\ncontrol uncertainty of 0 .2 ◦C. The viscometer was operated at a rotational speed of\n100 rpm using cone number CP42, recommended for the viscosity range of 0 .3m P a· s\nto 6000 mPa · s. The viscosity measurement was repeated ten times, and the result is\nreported as an average with a standard deviation of 0 .02 mPa · s.\nThe density was measured using a DMA-38 oscillating U-tube density meter from\nAnton Paar that measures sample density values accurately to 1 kg · m−3 in the\ntemperature range of 15 ◦Ct o4 0 ◦C.\n3 Results and Discussion\nThe density of the ferroﬂuid samples and transformer oil were measured within the\n15 ◦Ct o4 0 ◦C temperature range, and the results of measurements are shown in\nFig. 1. The variation of density with temperature for all samples studied obeys a linear\nrelation,\nρ = a + bT , (1)\nwhere T is expressed in K and ρ in kg · m−3. The values of coefﬁcients a and b\nobtained by ﬁtting Eq. 1 to the density data are listed in Table 1.\nFigure 2 shows the ﬂow curve, and the temperature dependence of the viscosity is\npresented in the inset for the transformer oil (carrier liquid). The shear stress versus\nshear rate dependence is linear presenting a Newtonian-like ﬂuid behavior; thus, within\nthe temperature range of the measurements, the transformer oil viscosity dependence\non temperature can be described by the well-known Arrhenius formula,\nη = 0.00012 exp\n( 3343\nT\n)\n, (2)\n123\n798 Int J Thermophys (2011) 32:795–806\n15 20 25 30 35 40\n850\n900\n950\n1000\n1050\n1100\n1150\n1200\nρ, kg·m\n-3\nT, °C\n oil        0.05 %\n 0.1 %   0.2 %\n 0.4 %   0.8 %\n 1.6 %   3.2 %\nFig. 1 Temperature dependencies of density for FF samples and mineral oil ITO100\nTable 1 V alues of parameters\na,b obtained from ﬁtting Eq. 1\nto the temperature dependence\nof density for transformer\noil-based ferroﬂuid samples\nSample a (kg · m−3) b (kg · m−3 · K−1)\nMineral oil 1056 −0.689\nφm,1 =6.60 % 1831 −1.027\nφm,2 =3.30 % 1445 −0.857\nφm,3 =1.65 % 1237 −0.754\nφm,4 =0.82 % 1129 −0.689\nφm,5 =0.41 % 1100 −0.697\nφm,6 =0.20 % 1069 −0.670\nφm,7 =0.10 % 1062 −0.676\nφm,8 =0.05 % 1061 −0.689\nwhere η is the dynamic viscosity in mPa · s and T is the temperature in K.\nThe results of the ultrasonic velocity measurements are shown in Fig. 3.T h e\nobtained results are in qualitative agreement with simple macroscopic theories that\npredict a parabolic relationship between the ultrasonic velocity in a colloidal mixture\nand the volume concentration of the continuous phase [ 7].\nFigure 4 shows the experimental results of ultrasonic attenuation, αf\n−2, as a func-\ntion of magnetite particle concentration, φm, for temperatures in the range of 10 ◦C\nto 80 ◦C. For all temperatures the ultrasonic attenuation increases with increasing\nvolume concentration of the magnetite particles.\nTo calculate the PSD function from ultrasonic attenuation data, information about\nthe various physical parameters of the solid particles and liquid dispersion medium\nis required.

The thermophysical parameters characterizing the magnetite/surfac-\ntant aggregates and carrier liquid used in analyzing ultrasonic attenuation data are\nlisted in Tables 2 and 3.\nThe ultrasonic attenuation results were analyzed by ﬁtting the theoretical model\nproposed by Vinogradov and Isakovich [ 4] to the experimental data for the tempera-\nture range of 20 ◦Ct o8 0 ◦C, with the parameters of the PSD function treated as ﬁtting\nvariables. The interaction between the acoustic wave and the suspended particles of\nnanometer size leads to additional attenuation of the sound compared to that in the\ncarrier liquid ( α0). Three mechanisms of this interaction associated with differences in\ndensity, thermal properties, and compressibility between phases can be distinguished:\nvisco-inertial absorption ( αη), thermal absorption ( αT ), and scattering losses ( αS)[ 3].\nFor ultrasound frequencies below 100 MHz, the scattering effect becomes negligible\n123\n802 Int J Thermophys (2011) 32:795–806\nfor particles below 1 µm. Also for small kd, i.e., for wavelengths larger than the parti-\ncle size, viscous and thermal components of ultrasound absorption are additive. This\nallows us to consider these effects separately and to neglect their possible couplings.\nThus, the overall ultrasonic attenuation per frequency squared in the magnetic liquid\ncan be conveniently expressed as the sum of these three contributions,\nα\nf 2 = αη\nf 2 + αT\nf 2 + α0\nf 2 .

Here, m is the logarithmic mean, σ is the logarithmic standard devi-\nation, and R0 = 2 nm is the minimal radius of the magnetite particle. The mean m\nand standard deviation σ which give the best agreement between the measured and\npredicted ultrasonic attenuation can be found by a least-squares analysis.\nAccording to the model proposed by Vinogradov–Isakovich [ 4], the contributions\nto absorption of ultrasound due to visco-inertial and thermal processes are given by\nαη\nf 2 = K πφa\nc\nRmax∫\nRmin\nf (R)R2 × Q(R, f ) + S(R, f )q3τV f\nQ(R, f )2 + W (R, f ) dR + 2π2τV\nc , (14)\nwhere\nK = 4π(1 − φa)(ρa − ρf )2\n9ρηf\n, Q(R, f ) = 1 + R\n√\nq1 f,\nS (R, f ) = R\n√\nq1 f + 2\n9 q1 R2 f + q2 R2 f,\nW (R, f ) = q1 R2 f + 4\n9 R3\n√\n(q1 f )3 + 2q2 R3√\nq1 f ,\nq1 = πρf\nηf\n, q2 = 4π(1 − φa)ρaρf\n9ρηf\n,\nq3 = 4πρ2\na\n(1 − ϕa)(ρa − ρf )2 ,τ V = αf\nf 2\nρf c3\nf\n2π2ρc2 ,\nand\nαT\nf 2 =− φa\nf 2\nRmax∫\nRmin\nf (R)Im\n[\n− jλaλf [Za − tanh(Za)](Zf + 1)\nλa[Za − tanh(Za)]+ λf (Zf + 1)tanh(Za)\n]\ndR, (15)\n123\nInt J Thermophys (2011) 32:795–806 803\nwhere\nZ = 3ρTc\n2R2\n( γa\nρaCa\n− γf\nρf Cf\n) 2\n,\nZa = (1 + j)R\n√\nπ fρaCaλ−1a , j =\n√\n−1,\nZf = (1 + j)R\n√\nπ fρf Cf λ−1\nf .\nThe subscripts a and f refer to the properties of the magnetite/oleic acid aggregates\nand the transformer oil, respectively.\nThe results of the ultrasonic attenuation data analysis for all temperatures are shown\nin Fig. 5.

The error bars represent the deviations of experimental\ndata from the ﬁtted theoretical curves. A systematic decrease in the accuracy of the\nﬁts with increasing temperature can be observed. This can be due to worse estimation\nof parameters, especially heat capacities, for higher temperatures. In some cases their\nvalues had to be extrapolated outside the range of available experimental data points.\nThe PSD parameters for all temperatures are listed in Table 4. It is also seen from\nFig. 5 that the viscous losses dominate in ultrasonic attenuation for higher values of\nvolume concentrations of magnetite particles φ\nm. However, the role of thermal losses\nin ultrasound attenuation substantially increases for higher temperatures. This means\nthat a neglect of heat losses, especially at higher temperatures and in more concentrated\nsamples, can lead to improper values of the PSD parameters.\nFigure 6 shows the log-normal PSD obtained by the ultrasonic method for various\ntemperatures in the range of 20\n◦Ct o8 0 ◦C. It is seen from the ﬁgure that the amount\nof larger particles decreases with temperature. The effect of temperature on the PSD\ncan be due to: (1) thermal expansion of particles and (2) break down of the aggregates\ncomposed of two or more magnetite particles. The ﬁrst factor leads to an increase of\nthe amount of larger particles and is rather small. This is not the case in our measure-\nments. On the other hand, if the magnetic dipole–dipole attractive interaction exceeds\nthe thermal energy and steric repulsion, an aggregation of magnetic particles will take\nplace.

Inset shows comparisons of the PSDs obtained from VSM [ 5] and the ultrasound\nabsorption data\nness of a protective surfactant layer and δm is the thickness of the magnetically inactive\nlayer on the surface of the particles [ 11]. That is why magneto-granulometric analysis\nbased on VSM measurements, which permits us to ﬁnd only the size of the particle\nmagnetic core, usually leads to lower values of the mean particle radius R and to the\nPSD with a smaller amount of larger particles. This can be seen in Fig. 6 where the\nPSDs obtained from VSM and ultrasound experiments are compared. Some differ-\nences in PSDs obtained by different techniques are the result of the chosen method.\nIt means that the instruments based on different physical principles can yield slightly\ndifferent PSDs [ 3,12].\n4 Conclusions\nThis article presents the results of the temperature dependence of the PSD in a\ntransformer oil-based ferroﬂuid. To determine the PSD, the ultrasonic velocity and\n123\n806 Int J Thermophys (2011) 32:795–806\nattenuation were measured as a function of the volume fraction of the dispersed phase\nin the temperature range of 20 ◦Ct o8 0 ◦C. The samples of different volume concen-\ntrations of magnetite were obtained from the original ferroﬂuid through subsequent\ndilution with the preparation solvent. The PSD obtained from ultrasound attenua-\ntion data exhibits a dependence on temperature. With an increase of temperature, the\namount of larger structures decreases due to breaking down of aggregates consisting\nof two or more magnetite particles. The mean particle radius obtained from the ultra-\nsonic measurements is larger than that obtained from the magnetization curve. This is\nbecause the ultrasonic method leads to a hydrodynamic radius which is greater than\nthe size of the magnetic core by the surfactant and magnetically inactive layers.\nAcknowledgments The studies were supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education\nGrant N202 097 32/2406.
