  "abstract": "A detailed simulation of a large 33 metric ton wheel loader, carrying out the short loading cycle, has been performed. Two systems have been compared and examined side by side: The conventional system, having a mechanical transmission for driving the wheels and a conventional load sensing hydraulic circuit for the work and steering cylinders. A new hydraulic hybrid system for the wheel drive and the implements, applying new and efficient hydrau- lic pumps and motors.The core of the new system is the hydraulic transformers which convert and control all the hydraulic power flows inside the loader. The new system results in a reduction of the fuel consumption of about 50% in the analyzed cycle. The new transmission and hydraulic system also results in a strong reduction of the cooler demands.",
