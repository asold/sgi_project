Contrary to using a copper wire, the use of an MPW allows for a reduction of the winding\nloss component due to the proximity e ﬀect. In particular, we investigate the 1 MHz LLC resonant converter using an\nMPW. An 8.8% decrease in the power loss is achieved, giving 33 W at 1 MHz and 1 kW.\nKeywords: copper loss, LLC resonant converter, magnetoplated wire, power density\n1. Introduction\nStable DC power, in the kW range, is necessary for large\nPCs, such as servers, to allow for the simultaneous func-\ntioning of a CPU, an HDD, and a cooling fan drive. The\nswitched-mode power supply, which is used for servers,\nrequires high-eﬃciency and high-power density converters.\nHowever, the transformer performance is insuﬃcient for im-\nproving converter eﬃciency and power density.\nThe converter power density increases with the driving fre-\nquency\n(1)–(4). However, a high-frequency drive produces a\ngreat switching loss and power loss at the transformer, thus,\nreducing the eﬃciency of the converter.\nThe LLC resonant converter eﬀectively reduces the switch-\ning loss\n(5)–(8), enabling soft switching. In addition, the leakage\ninductance of the transformer can be used as an inductor for\nresonance. Consequently, reducing the number of circuit ele-\nments reduces the size of the converter. SiC and GaN also ef-\nfectively reduce the switching loss\n(3)–(5) (7)–(9) because the elec-\ntricity loss is extremely lower than in a device with the con-\nventional Si power semiconductor.\nThe transformer loss can be classiﬁed into iron and copper\nlosses. Reduction of the iron loss can be achieved using core\nmaterials with improved properties and by changing the core\nshape\n(10)–(14). Copper loss is reduced by changing the wire’s\nshape and winding form. The factors a ﬀecting the copper\nloss are the deﬂection of the current densities by the skin and\nproximity e ﬀects. Litz wire is used for transformer wind-\ning to reduce the AC resistance due to the skin e ﬀect. How-\never, the Litz wire causes an increase in the AC resistance\na) Correspondence to: Tatsuya Ya mamoto.

Therefore, we propose the use of\na magnetoplated wire (MPW) for the transformer coil to re-\nduce copper loss. MPW is composed of a magnetic thin ﬁlm\nthat is plated onto the circumference of a copper wire (COW).\nThe MPW decreases the AC resistance because of the prox-\nimity eﬀect; an alternating magnetic ﬂux ﬂows through the\nmagnetic thin ﬁlm with greater permeability and resistivity\ncompared to copper\n(15)–(17).\nIn the present study, the transformer resistances using a\nLitz wire with a copper wire (LCW) and Litz wire with an\nMPW (LMW) are measured. Additionally, the power loss\ncharacteristics of the transformers in the LLC resonant con-\nverters of the LCW and LMW are compared. We discuss the\nfollowing matters:\n1) Impedance characteristics of the transformer.\n2) Eﬃciency and power loss characteristics of the LLC res-\nonant converter.\n2. Structure of LLC Resonant Converter using\nMagnetoplated Wire\n2.1 Structure of Winding Wire Figure 1 shows the\nwinding wire structure for the transformer. The COW with\na diameter of 70 μm is plated with a 10- μm-thick insulating\nﬁlm. The LCW is composed of 300 COWs. The LCW sec-\ntional area is 1.15 mm\n2.\nThe MPW is a copper wire with a diameter of 70μm plated\non magnetic thin ﬁlms (Fe and Ni). The Fe and Ni thin ﬁlms\nare 1.15 μm and 0.065 μm thick, respectively. The Ni ﬁlm\nwas plated for ease of soldering. The LMW is composed of\n300 MPWs. The LMW sectional area is 1.15 mm\n2.\n2.2 Structure of Transformer Figure 2 shows the\nstructure of the transformer in the LLC resonant converter.\nThe core of the transformer is made of MC2 materials (JFE),\nand the shape of the core is EER42D. The core has a gap on\nthe primary side center leg to cause leakage inductance. The\ngaps of the core in the LCW and the LMW are 1.1 mm wide.\nFigure 3 shows the winding structure of the transformer\nc⃝2018 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. 43\nLLC Resonant Converter Using Magnetoplated WireʢTatsuya Yamamotoet al.ʣ\n(a) Litz wire with copper wires (LCW) (b) L itz wire with magnetoplated wires (LMW)\nFig. 1.

Winding structure of the transformer for the LLC\nresonant converter (unit: mm)\nin the LLC resonant converter. The primary coil has a gap\nto increase the leakage inductance, and it has 13 turns with\nthe gap. The secondary side of the transformer is the cen-\nter tap output. The secondary coil is composed of two coils:\nS1 (inside coil) and S2 (outside coil). An insulating tape is\nsandwiched between the two coils. There are six turns in the\ncoil.\n2.3 Circuitry of the LLC Resonant Converter\nFigure 4 shows the circuit structure of the LLC resonant\nconverter. The inverter part is composed of four FETs that\nare connected through a full bridge. The diodes between the\ndrain and the source of the FET are parasitism diodes. The\nFET of the inverter is GaN FET.\n44 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.7, No.1, 2018\nLLC Resonant Converter Using Magnetoplated WireʢTatsuya Yamamotoet al.ʣ\nFig. 4. Circuit structure of the LLC resonant converter\n(a) Primary coil (b) Secondary coil\nFig. 5. Resistance vs. frequency characteristics\nThe capacitor Cr is a resonance capacitor connected to the\nprimary side of the transformer. The inductance Lsh is the\nleakage inductance of transformer, and it is used for the res-\nonance inductor. Lm is the excitation inductance. Cr, Lsh,\nand Lm are connected in series. The secondary side of the\ntransformer is the center tap output, and it is connected with\nrectiﬁer diodes. The diode for the rectiﬁer is SiC diode.\n3. Impedance Characteristics of the Transformer\nfor the LLC Resonant Converter\n3.1 Resistance vs. Frequency Characteristics The\nimpedance characteristics of the transformer for the LLC res-\nonant converter were measured using an impedance analyzer\n(Agilent, 4294A).\nFigure 5 shows the resistance versus the frequency charac-\nteristics of the transformer. At frequency 1 MHz, the resis-\ntance of the primary coil using LCW was 1.16 Ω, and using\nLMW, it was 0.89 Ω. Thus, the LMW resistance was lower\nby 23.2% compared to that of the LCW. At the same fre-\nquency, the resistance of the secondary coil using LCW was\n0.75 Ω, whereas it was 0.46 Ωusing LMW. Therefore, the\nLMW resistance was decreased by 38.7% compared to the\nLCW resistance.\nThe skin depth of copper wire is 66 μm at frequency\n1 MHz. Since the diameter of the strand in the LCW and\nthe LMW is less than twice the skin depth, AC resistance due\nto the skin e ﬀect does not a ﬀect. The factor of reducing the\nresistance of the transformer was reduction of AC resistance\ndue to the proximity eﬀect by using LMW.\n3.2 Inductance vs. Frequency Characteristics\nFigure 6 shows the inductance versus the frequency char-\nacteristics of the transformer. At a frequency of 1 MHz, the\ninductance of the primary coil using LCW and LMW were\n45.5 μH. At a 1 MHz driving frequency, we produced the\ntransformer so that the inductance of the primary side was\nequaled. At 1 MHz, the inductance of the secondary coil\nusing LCW was 13.4 μH, and it was 13.9 μHu s i n gL M W .\nTherefore, the LMW inductance was increased by 3.7% com-\npared to the LCW inductance. This is because the magnetic\nenergy is stored in a magnetic thin ﬁlm.\n3.3 Short Circuit Inductance and the Coupling Coef-\nﬁcient Figure 7 shows the short circuit inductance versus\nthe frequency characteristics of the transformer. As a condi-\ntion of measurement, the secondary side of the transformer\nwas short circuited.\nAt 1 MHz, the short circuit inductance of the coil using\nLCW was 12.1 μH, and 13.5 μH using LMW. Thus, the short\ncircuit inductance of LMW was 11.6 % higher than that of\n45 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.7, No.1, 2018\nLLC Resonant Converter Using Magnetoplated WireʢTatsuya Yamamotoet al.ʣ\n(a) Primary coil (b) Secondary coil\nFig. 6.

This is because the magnetic energy is stored in a mag-\nnetic thin ﬁlm, and the interlinkage ﬂux of secondary coil de-\ncreases.\nFigure 8 shows the coupling coe ﬃcient versus the fre-\nquency characteristics of the transformer.

Eﬃciency and Power Loss of LLC Resonant\nConverter\n4.1 Eﬃciency and Power loss Characteristics The\nswitching frequency of the converter was 1 MHz. The input\npower P\ni and the output power Po were measured with an\nelectronic load (Keisokugiken, LN-1000C-G7) by changing\nthe load RL. The input power and the output power were\nmeasured with a power meter (Yokogawa, WT1800).\nFigure 9 shows the e ﬃciency ηversus the output current\nIo of the LLC resonant converter using the LCW and LMW\ntransformers. At the output current of 4 A, the eﬃciencies of\nLCW and LMW were 96.5% and 96.8%, respectively; thus,\nthe eﬃciency of the LMW was improved by 0.3%.\nFigure 10 shows the power loss P\nloss versus the output cur-\nrent Io of the LLC resonant converter using the LCW and\nLMW transformers. At the output current of 4 A, the power\nlosses of LCW and LMW were 36.2 W and 33 W, respec-\ntively; the power loss of LMW was decreased by 8.8% com-\npared to that of LCW. These reason is the reduction of the\nresistance due to the proximity eﬀect, when LMW is used.\n4.2 Temperature Increase in the Transformer\nFigure 11 shows the distribution of the surface tempera-\nture of the transformers winding using LCW and LMW. The\ntemperature inside the winding wire is di ﬃcult to measure;\ntherefore, we measured the surface temperature. The surface\ntemperatures of LCW and LMW at the output current of I\no\n=4 A were 114◦C and 85.9 ◦C, respectively; thus, the tem-\nperature of LMW was 28.1 ◦C less than that of LCW. This\nresult contributes to miniaturization of the cooling fan of the\nconverter and downsizing of the switching power supply.\nThis lower increase results from the greater ability of\nLMW to reduce AC resistance compared to LCW.\n4.3 Power Density of the LLC Resonant Converter\nThe volume of the LLC resonant converter is 338.7 cm 3,\nand the power density is 2.95 W/cm3 for an output power of\n1k W .\n5. Conclusions\nThe main contributions of this study are as follows.\n1) Impedance characteristics of the transformer.\nAt the frequency of 1 MHz, the resistance of the primary\ncoil was 1.16Ω,u s i n gL C W ,a n d0 . 8 9Ω, using LMW. There-\nfore, the resistance of the LMW was 23.2% lower by than that\nof LCW, and this is attributed to the restraint of the proximity\neﬀect.\n2) Eﬃciency and power loss characteristics of the LLC reso-\nnant converter.\nAt the output current of 4 A and output power of 1 kW, the\neﬃciencies of LCW and LMW were 96.5% and 96.8%, re-\nspectively; thus, the eﬃciency of LMW was higher by 0.3%.\nMoreover, the power losses of LCW and LMW were 36.2 W\nand 33 W, respectively; therefore, the power loss of LMW\nwas 8.8% lower. This is attributed to the reduction of the\nresistance due to the proximity eﬀect when LMW is used.\nBased on the present results, it is possible to reduce the re-\nsistance by using LMW in MHz drive converter. However,\nthe size of the transformer is still bigger than that of the other\ncircuit elements. We are currently examining further loss re-\nduction and downsizing of the transformer.\nReferences\n( 1 ) K. Matsuura, H. Yanagi, S. Tomioka , and T.
