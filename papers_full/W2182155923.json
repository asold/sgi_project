Journal, Vol.28,No.4,2010     On-Chip RF Transformer Performance \n        Improvement Technique \n677\nIntroduction \nOn-chip transformers contribute \nsubstantially in enhancing reliability, \nefficiency, and performance of \nsilicon-integrated radio-frequency \n(RF) circuits. Recently, much research \nhas focused on the design          \nand characterization of integrated \ntransformers. Transformers are \ntypically used for impedance \nmatching and conversion between \ndifferential and single-ended signals \n(balun operation), power combining, \nand tuning networks. Many \nresearchers have reported the \nintegration of on-chip transformers in \npower amplifiers (PAs), voltage-\ncontrolled oscillators (VCOs), and \nlow-noise amplifiers (LNAs) [1]. \n     By magnetically coupling two \ninductors, one can create a \ntransformer, in which, the magnetic \nfield created by the port-1 current I1 \nthrough the primary inductor L1 \ngenerates a voltage in the secondary \ninductor L2. At the same time, the \ncurrent through the secondary I2 will \nmagnetically induce a voltage in the \nprimary circuit. The port voltages of \nthe loosely coupled lossy transformer \nV1 and V2 in Figure 1(a) are related to \ntheir port currents through the \nfollowing equations [2]: \n\n\n\n⋅\n\n\n\n− −\n−+=\n\n\n\n2\n1\n22\n11\n2\n1\nI\nI\nL j R M j\nM j L j R\nV\nV\nww\nww\n….(1) \n2 1.L L k M=  ….(2) \n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\nV\nV\nI\nI\nL\nLn ≈ ≈ = ….(3) \nwhere M is the mutual inductance, k is \nthe coupling factor, and n is the turn \nratio between primary and secondary \ncoils. Figure 1(b) shows the \nequivalent model for the transformer \nin Figure 1(a), where the lossy \ninductors of the transformer are \nmodeled by the equivalent series \nresistors R1 and R2 and net \ninductances L1 and L2 for a single \nfrequency. The quality factors Q1 and \nQ2, of the primary and the secondary \ninductors can be calculated in terms of \nR1 and R2, respectively, i.e. [2], \n1\n1\n1\nQ\nLR w=  and \n2\n2\n2\nQ\nLR w= . …(4) \nTransformer Figure of Merit \nIn the case of a transformer, the main \nobjective is the transfer of power from \nprimary to secondary side. Thus the \ntransformer efficiency (\nηT)\n can be \ndefined as the ratio of the output \npower (delivered to the load) to \nthe input power. In view of the \ndependence of this ratio on the \ntermination impedances, a more \nuseful choice of figure of merit for RF \ntransformers is the minimum insertion \nloss (ILmin) [3], which is defined as the \ninverse of the maximum available \ngain (Gmax) and can be written as: \nmax\nmin\n1\nGIL = .  ….(5) \nThe maximum available gain is \ndefined by Ng et al.  [4] and it has \nbeen used as a metric to measure the \nperformance of transformers. Gmax can \nbe calculated using the following \nequations: \n)( 2 1\n2\nmaxmax x x xG + − + = =h  \n)( 2 1\n1\n2\nx x x+ + +\n=    …(6) \n2\nRe\n2\nIm\n2\nRe1\nk Q Q k\nkx\nS P+\n−=  ….

As \nshown in this figure, increasing the \nquality factors QP and QS or the \nmutual coupling factor k leads            \nto a smaller ILmin. Therefore, an \nimprovement of the minimum \ninsertion loss can be achieved by an \noptimization of the quality factors of \nthe transformer coils and the mutual \ncoupling between them. \n \nOn-Chip Transformer Performance \nImprovement Techniques \nAlthough on-chip transformers are \nmore complicated than inductors, \nhowever, many of the techniques that \nhave been applied to the optimization \nof inductors are also applicable         \nto transformers, especially those \nmethods used to improve the quality \nfactor Q of the metal windings. There \nare several ways to improve Q. Some \nimprovements can be made through \nthe fabrication process, such as using \nthick copper top layers or strapping \nmultiple levels of metal layers to \nreduce the ohmic losses; or using a \nthick oxide layer and/or high \nresistivity substrate (HRS) [5]; or \neven employing micromachining \ntechniques [6]. Other improvements \ncan be made through careful layout, \nsuch as using pattern ground shield \n(PGS) [7] to reduce the substrate loss \ninduced by electrical fields. \n     Transformers make use of the \nmagnetic coupling between the \nprimary and secondary windings. \nFigure 3 shows the coupling \ncoefficient k versus number of turns \nN, metal trace width W, and spacing s \nof the primary or secondary windings \nfor a 1:1 Frlan transformer (see  \nFigure 4). For the same width and \nspacing, there is a large improvement \nin k as N increases from 1 to 2, \nbecause of the coupling between \nadjacent lines. However, further \nincrease in N does not improve k \nconsiderably. For the same N, k \ndecreases when W and s increase. \nHowever, wider metal traces usually \nhave better Q. \n     For some applications, such as the \noutput transformers for PAs, the large \nPDF created with pdfFactory Pro trial version www.pdffactory.com\nEng. & Tech. Journal, Vol.28,No.4,2010                      On-Chip RF Transformer Performance \n                                                                                           Improvement Technique \n  \n \n 679\ndc current requires wide metal    \ntraces for reliability. As illustrated \npreviously,  in   Figure 2   and     \nequation (11), to obtain a minimum \ninsertion loss ILmin, the product of \nk2QpQs needs to be maximized. \nHence, there must be an optimum \nmetal width to balance k and Q for  \nthe maximum k2QpQs. \nThe Proposed Technique to \nImprove Transformer Performance \nWithout altering the fabrication \nprocess, the wide metal traces can be \nsplit into multiple parallel segments \nand interleaved, as shown in Figure 5, \nin order to improve coupling \ncoefficient, k. Another advantage is \nthat the proximity effect and currant \ncrowding are also mitigated. Because \nthe effective width of the primary or \nsecondary winding is enlarged, the \nself-inductances for the primary ( Lp) \nand secondary ( Ls) are reduced while \nthe resistance remains about the same. \nSo the quality factors for the primary \n(Qp) and secondary ( Qs) will be \nreduced at low frequencies. The \ncoupling capacitance between the \nprimary and secondary windings \nincreases. These contradictory effects \nneed to be balanced in order to \nachieve an optimum minimum \ninsertion loss (ILmin). \n \nSimulation Results \nTo verify the feasibility of the \nsegmentation idea in the transformer \nperformance improvement, a square \ntransformer with different \nsegmentations is simulated using \nEMSight simulator. EMSight \nsimulator is a 2.5-Dimension (2.5-D) \nelectro-magnetic (EM) solver \nprovided with Microwave Office \n(MWO) 2007 (version 7.5) \nRF/Microwave software tools from \nApplied Wave Research (AWR),    \nInc. [9]. It is based on an integral \nequation formulation of Maxwell ’s \nequations. It uses a volume mesh      \nof conductors to handle layered \ndielectrics and substrates. It correctly \naccounts for sidewall capacitance, via \nresistance and inductance, and current \ncrowding effects. EMSight simulator \nusually takes a long time, and a great \ndeal of memory to simulate even \nsimple structures. However, it can \ngive relatively accurate results in a \nfrequency range, as long as the \nsimulation parameters are chosen \ncorrectly. So, it is useful as a \nvalidation tool when the geometry of \nthe desired transformer is fixed. \nMoreover, given the high computation \ncost in EMSight simulation, it is not a \ngood tool for optimization in the \ndesign process. \n     A summary of the important \nparameters for the transformer \nsimulation process are listed in    \nTable 1. Figure 6 shows an example \nof an EMSight setup for a 1:1 square \ntransformer. Various transformer test \nstructures, using the segmentation \nscheme and their simulation results \nare summarized in Table 2. If the \nouter dimension ( Dout) is to be kept \nconstant, the inductance ( L) will \ndecrease as the metal traces are split \ninto more segments (T 1, T 2, T 3, and \nT4). Alternatively, Dout will need to \ngrow (T 5 and T 6) to achieve the    \nsame L of the basic transformer \nstructure (T1). \n     Figure 7   shows   that   for \ntransformers T1, T 2, T 3, and T 4 (with \nNseg equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4, \nrespectively), the quality factor ( Q) \ndecrease when Nseg increases. \nHowever, ILmin of transformer T 3 is \nabout 0.44 dB less than ILmin of T1 due \nto improvement in k. An ILmin as low \nas 1.12 dB can be achieved in \nPDF created with pdfFactory Pro trial version www.pdffactory.com\nEng. & Tech. Journal, Vol.28,No.4,2010                      On-Chip RF Transformer Performance \n                                                                                           Improvement Technique \n  \n \n 680\ntransformer T 3. For transformer T 4, \nalthough the segmentation scheme \nstill improves k, the decrease of Q \noffsets the benefit, and the resulting \nILmin is not effectively improved. \nFinally, Figure 7 shows a similar \nincrease in k and decrease in Qp, Qs, \nand ILmin due to Nseg for transformer \nstructures T5 and T 6 (where Nseg equal \nto 2 and 3, respectively). \nConclusions \nAn on-chip transformer design and \nlayout technique is proposed to \nachieve high magnetic coupling \ncoefficient and thereby low-insertion \nloss, by segmenting and interleaving \nwide metal traces. Results have \nverified the proposed technique. In \nview of some practical issues of balun \ntransformers, especially those used for \nRF PAs, it is deemed necessary to \ngive special attention to their design \nto overcome any drawbacks. Usually \na one-turn transformer is chosen for \nits better quality factor. Wide traces \nare used to meet the current density \nrules. Therefore, the magnetic \ncoupling coefficient k is relatively \nsmall (around 0.5). It anticipated the \ntransformers with traces segmented \nand interleaved, discussed in this \nwork, can be used to improve k.  \nReferences \n[1] El-Gharniti O., Kerherve E. and \nBegueret J.-B., “Modeling and \nCharacterization of On-Chip \nTransformers for Silicon  \nRFIC,” IEEE Transactions on \nMicrowave Theory and \nTechniques,    vol. 55,    no. 4, \npp. 607-615, April 2007.  \n[2] Aoki I., Kee S.
