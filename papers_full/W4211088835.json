Critical to all search engines is the problem of designing an effective\nretrieval model that can rank documents accurately for a given query. This has been a central research\nproblem in information retrieval for several decades. In the past ten years, a new generation of retrieval\nmodels, often referred to as statistical language models, has been successfully applied to solve many\ndifferent information retrieval problems. Compared with the traditional models such as the vector\nspace model, these new models have a more sound statistical foundation and can leverage statistical\nestimation to optimize retrieval parameters. They can also be more easily adapted to model non-\ntraditional and complex retrieval problems. Empirically, they tend to achieve comparable or better\nperformance than a traditional model with less effort on parameter tuning.\nThis book systematically reviews the large body of literature on applying statistical language\nmodels to information retrieval with an emphasis on the underlying principles, empirically effective\nlanguage models, and language models developed for non-traditional retrieval tasks. All the relevant\nliterature has been synthesized to make it easy for a reader to digest the research progress achieved\nso far and see the frontier of research in this area. The book also offers practitioners an informative\nintroduction to a set of practically useful language models that can effectively solve a variety of\nretrieval problems. No prior knowledge about information retrieval is required, but some basic\nknowledge about probability and statistics would be useful for fully digesting all the details.\nKEYWORDS\nInformation

As the most useful tools\nfor combating information overload, search engines are now becoming increasingly important and\nhave been successfully deployed in many different application domains. The rapid rise of the search\nengine industry has generated much interest in information retrieval (IR) research and education.\nThis book is designed to help meet the needs of researchers, students, and developers of search\nengine applications for learning about the frontier of information retrieval research, particularly\nrecent progress in developing new information retrieval models.\nCritical to all search engines is the problem of designing an effective retrieval model that can\nrank documents accurately for a given query. This has been a central research problem in information\nretrieval for several decades. In the past ten years, a new generation of retrieval models, often referred\nto as statistical language models, has been successfully applied to solve many different information\nretrieval problems. Compared with the traditional models such as the vector space model, these\nnew models have many advantages, such as a sound statistical foundation, possibilities of leveraging\navailable statistical estimation methods to optimize retrieval parameters, and easiness to adapt to\nnon-traditional and complex retrieval problems.\nThe main purpose of this book is to review and synthesize the large body of literature on\nstatistical language models for information retrieval so that a reader can easily digest the literature\nand see the frontier of research in this area. Emphasis has been put on covering the underlying\nprinciples of all the models, empirically effective language models, and language models developed\nfor non-traditional retrieval tasks. A secondary goal of the book is to introduce to practitioners a\nset of practically useful language models that can effectively solve a variety of retrieval application\nproblems.\nThe book is based on a series of tutorials on this topic that I have given at various information\nretrieval conferences, and is an expansion of a related survey that I wrote for the Foundations and\nT rends in Information Retrieval [17]. Compared with the survey, this book is more selfcontained and\ncovers all the basic models with much more detail.The survey was written mainly for researchers with\nsome previous knowledge about information retrieval, but the book is intended to be understandable\nto readers without prior background on information retrieval. T o achieve this goal, the book has\nincluded a concise introduction to the basic concepts in information retrieval and an entire chapter\nto provide a general survey of all information retrieval models. It has also much more detailed\nexplanation of the basic models, which should help readers with no background in information\nretrieval to digest the materials. Unfortunately, given the size of the book, it is hard to include all the\nnecessary background materials. Thus, in cases when some discussions are not easy to follow due to\nunfamiliarity with some concepts in information retrieval, the readers should refer to some textbooks\nxii PREFACE\non information retrieval (e.g., [18], [19], [20], and [21])). Although no prior knowledge about IR\nis assumed, most materials presented in the book rely on some basic knowledge of probability and\nstatistics such as multinomial distribution and maximum likelihood estimation. Readers with no\nsuch knowledge are recommended to ﬁrst read some textbook on probability and statistics (e.g.,\n[22]) before reading this book. However, readers with no knowledge about probability and statistics\nshould still be able to understand all the major ideas and follow most of the high-level discussions.\nThe organization of the book is as follows. The ﬁrst chapter provides some background on\ninformation retrieval and statistical language models for readers with no such background. Chapter 2\ncontains a broad overview of different retrieval models to give the readers a big picture about the\nentire space of retrieval models and where language models ﬁt in. Starting from Chapter 3, we then\nsystematically introduce various kinds of retrieval models based on language modeling. In Chapter 3,\nwe introduce the very ﬁrst generation of language models (called simple query likelihood retrieval\nmodels) which are computationally as efﬁcient as any existing retrieval model. Their good empirical\nperformance has motivated many follow-up studies and extensions of language models for retrieval.\nIn Chapter 4, we discuss a large body of work all aiming at extending and improving the basic\nlanguage modeling approach. These models (called complex query likelihood retrieval models) may\nachieve better performance, but also tend to be computationally much more expensive than the simple\nquery likelihood retrieval models. Feedback is an important component in an IR system, but it turns\nout that there is some difﬁculty in supporting feedback with the query likelihood retrieval models.\nIn Chapter 5, we present the Kullback-Leibler divergence retrieval model, which generalizes the\nquery likelihood retrieval model and also accommodates feedback (particularly pseudo feedback)\nthrough using feedback information to improve the estimate of a query language model. These\nfeedback models are among the most effective language models for retrieval. In Chapter 6, we\nfurther review a wide range of applications of language models to different special retrieval tasks\nwhere a standard language model is often extended or adapted to better ﬁt a speciﬁc application.\nIn Chapter 7, we introduce a family of language models that can be used to conduct latent topic\nanalysis and discuss their applications in information retrieval. Finally, we summarize and discuss\nfuture research directions in Chapter 8.\nThe book can be used as a supplementary textbook for a graduate or undergraduate course\non information retrieval or related topics (e.g., natural language processing, machine learning) to\nhelp students gain in-depth understanding of the basic language models for information retrieval.\nFor advanced models, however, the book only provides a high level discussion, thus readers will still\nneed to read the original papers to really understand them in detail. Chapters 2 and 7 are both\nrelatively selfcontained, so they can be used as standing alone introductions to retrieval models and\nprobabilistic topic models, respectively.\nMany people have directly or indirectly contributed to the completion of this book, and I\nwould like to thank all of them. First of all, I want to thank Graeme Hirst, editor of the Synthesis\nLectures on Human Language T echnologies series of the Synthesis Digital Library, and Michael\nMorgan, President of Morgan & Claypool Publishers, for offering me the opportunity to publish\nPREFACE xiii\nthis book. They have also provided very useful feedback about the content of the book. I am very\ngrateful to my Ph.D. advisor John Lafferty for his supervision of my dissertation on this topic;\nthe main conceptual framework and a substantial part of this book are based on my dissertation. I\nam also very grateful to Jamie Callan for encouraging me to give a tutorial on this topic at several\nconferences. The tutorial has formed the basis of this book. Without John’s technical advice and\nJamie’s encouragement, I would not have been able to write this book.\nI gratefully acknowledge the support of my own research on this topic by the Advanced\nResearch and Development Activity in Information T echnology (ARDA) under its Statistical Lan-\nguage Modeling for Information Retrieval Research Program, by the National Science Foundation\nunder a CAREER grant (IIS-0347933), by Google, Microsoft, and IBM through their research\nprograms, and by the Alfred P . Sloan Foundation through a research fellowship. Any opinions, ﬁnd-\nings, and conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this book are, of course, those of the author\nand do not necessarily reﬂect the views of the sponsors.\nI am greatly indebted to several people who have directly helped improving the quality of\nthis book. Wessel Kraaij and another anonymous reviewer have carefully reviewed a draft of this\nbook and offered extremely valuable comments which have helped to improve the quality of the\nbook signiﬁcantly. Donald Metzler and two other anonymous reviewers have provided many useful\ncomments for the survey paper mentioned earlier; those comments have also helped improving the\nquality of this book. Naturally, any errors that remain are solely my own responsibility.\nI also want to thank many researchers with whom I have had useful discussions on various\ntopics covered in this book, especially my students and co-authors. Although I cannot list all the\nnames here, I would like to mention W. Bruce Croft, Stephen Robertson, Victor Lavrenko, Rong\nJin, Tao Tao, David A. Evans, Qiaozhu Mei, and Wessel Kraaij; all of them have inﬂuenced my\nunderstanding of some major technical issues discussed in the book.\nSpecial thanks are due to C.L. T ondo and Sara Kreisman for their help with preparing the\nﬁnal version of the book.\nFinally, and above all, I must thank my wife Mei for her love and huge support throughout\nthe process of writing this book. I dedicate this book to her.\nChengXiang Zhai\nDepartment of Computer Science\nGraduate School of Library and Information Science\nDepartment of Statistics\nInstitute for Genomic Biology\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nJanuary 2009",
