ICOs have \nbecome widely popular for cryptocurrency fundraising, often \ngenerating millions of dollars,  and surpassing traditional \ncrowdfunding methods like Initial Public Offerings. \nHowever, ICO is a risky way of investing and raising capital \ndue to the lack of regulations and standardisation . In this \nresearch, we delve into the impact of social media and \nsentiment analysis on the success of ICOs, employing various \nmachine learning models and Large Language Models . Our \nanalysis is based on data from over 1,000 ICOs gathered from \ndiverse ICO information platforms, coupled with a corpus of \n910,478 tweets associated with these ICOs. We extend our \ninvestigation to include other social media platforms such as \nBitcoinTalk, Telegram, Facebook, and Medium. Our analysis \nrevealed that valuable insights regarding the success of ICOs \ncan be derived by examining text sentiment and investigating \nmetadata across these diverse social media channels. \n \nKeywords—token sales, web scraping , sentiment analysis , \nsocial media, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from \nTransformers (BERT) \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nRecently, it has become difficult to overlook the role of \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain in the wave of \nthe Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) [1]. Marwala  and \nXing [1] argues that the joint force of these two \ntechnologies could determine the depth and breadth of the \n4IR. Blockchain technology enables new ways of \norganizing economic activities, reduces costs and time \nassociated with intermediaries, and strengthens the trust in \nan ecosystem of actors [2]. Lately, people are becoming \naccustomed with the idea of digital money in the form of \ncryptocurrencies like bitcoin, where transactions are \nrecorded on a secure, distributed ledger (blockchain). \nAlong this comes a new concept: the blockchain -based \ntoken. A token is a digital representation of some shared \nvalue. A considerable number of startups have employed \nblockchain for fundraising, known as Initial Coin \nOfferings (ICOs). Ideally, technology startups generate \nand sell tokens via blockchain in exchange for well \nestablished cryptocurrencies, mostly bitcoin and \nEthereum. This token sale, as known as ICO,  entails a \nlimited period of online sale of a predefined number of \ntokens to the public. The token generation event is \ngenerally a one-time event at the beginning of a project’s \nlifetime. The creation and sale of tokens occur either on an \nexisting blockchain, such as Ethereum, which is most \ncommon for ICOs, or on a new blockchain specifically \ncreated for a given ICO. The ICO was initiated in 2013, \nand since then, its volume has increased rapidly. By 2017, \nits funds had reached $3.5  B surpassing traditional \ncrowdfundings. This can be primarily attributed to the \nsuccess of five prominent ICOs; Filecoin $257  M, Tezos \n$232 M, EOS $185  M, Paragon $183 M and Bancor \n$153 M [3]. These figures highlight the significant interest \nfrom both ventures and investors in participating in such \nprojects. Nevertheless, the level of success achieved by \nICOs varies significantly across various projects. While \ncertain ICOs manage to attract hundreds of millio ns of \ndollars in funding, many others struggle to raise any fund. \nMoreover, ICOs represent a risky method of investing and \nraising funds due to the lack of regulations, which \nincreases the chances of scams [3]. According to research \nconducted by Statis Group, an ICO advisory firm, \napproximately 11% of investments made in ICOs were \nvictimized by fraudulent projects “scams” [4]. Hence, it is \npertinent to explore the fundamental factors that contribute \nto the success of ICOs. \nIn this study, we are monitoring the social media \nsentiment of ICOs from the time an ICO is launched all the \nway to the day it closes. The success of an Initial Public \nOfferings (IPO) or ICO is typically assessed after the \nfundraising period has concluded.  However, by sensing \nthe community engagement, and opinion in the different \nsocial media platforms during the fundraising, the ICO \ninitiators may take several actions to improve participation \nand attract more interest in their project to avoid a potential \nfailure. This can involve, intensifying their marketing \nefforts to raise awareness about their ICO through targeted \nadvertising campaigns, social media promotions, and \n \nManuscript received June 21, 202 4; revised July 10 , 2024; accepted \nAugust 13, 2024; published January 9, 2025. \nJournal of Advances in Information Technology, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025\n12\ndoi: 10.12720/jait.16.1.12-20\noutreach to potential investors through various channels. \nMoreover, offering incentives and bonuses to early \ninvestors can encourage participation. These incentives \nmay include bonus tokens, discounted prices, or exclusive \nbenefits for early contributors. \nHowever, in the domain of entrepreneurship and early -\nstage financing, the notion of success lacks a precise \ndefinition. Thus, studies use diverse approaches to \nevaluate funding success. Czaja  and Röder [5] use the \ncollected fund during the ICO as the dependant variable. \nThis suggests that the more funds an ICO collects, the \nmore successful it is. However, this perspective is not \nentirely accurate. For instance, consider a startup with a \nfunding goal of $10,000,000 but manages to raise only \n$1,000,000. This represents only 10% of their target. On \nthe other hand, another smaller startup with a funding goal \nof $10,000 and successfully collects it, that is a success \nirrespective of the small amount, as it fulfills their asserted \nneed to start their venture. This  is the second approach of \ndefining success in relation to the funding goal, which will \nbe used in this research. Unfortunately, ICOs tend to \ndisclose either a “ soft cap” or a “ hard cap”. The soft cap \nrepresents a minimum threshold, and if this target is not \nreached during the ICO, it usually results in a complete \nrefund of all investments made. To avoid such a scenario, \nICO initiators often set the soft cap at a  relatively low \nlevel. On the other hand, the hard cap denotes the \nmaximum amount of investment permitted by the ICO’s \nsmart contract algorithm. Consequently, both the soft cap \nand hard cap are insufficient benchmarks for evaluating \nICO funding success [5].  A standard ICO usually begins \nwith the creation of a white paper  [6]. It typically \nelucidates the underlying products or services, introduces \nthe project team, and outlines a business plan. It also \nencompasses details related to the token sale, including the \nquantity of tokens, the duration of the sale, and how the \nraised funds will be utilized [7]. Soon after, the initiators \nof the ICO leverage social media platforms  to actively \npromote their project. The marketing efforts primarily \nrevolve around activities conducted exclusively on social \nmedia platforms. Moreover, most startups introduce their \nproject on ICO information platforms . Typically, the \nentirety of an ICO marketing endeavors  is confined to \nonline channels [5]. Furthermore, in a qualitative research \nstudy, researchers conducted semi-structured interviews to \nexamine signals affecting ICO success. The findings \nindicate the significance of social media discussions \nwithin the blockchain community, owing to the \ndecentralized nature of the community’s ideology. \nSurprisingly, some investors rely solely on sentiment as \ntheir decision -making criterion [8]. For this reason, we \nbelieve that by tapping into social media channels and \nconducting sentiment analysis, we can uncover valuable \ninsights regarding the potential success of ICOs. To that \nend, we have collected and analyzed data from Twitter, \nBitcoinTalk, Telegram, Facebook, and Medium, while \napplying sentiment analysis to predict ICO success. \nIn this paper, we propose a combined approach based \non classification models such as Support Vector Machines \n(SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest, along \nwith sentiment analysis using Large Language Models \n(LLM), to identify significant features to predict ICO’s \nsuccess. In the following we highlight our main \ncontributions: \n• We scraped and analyzed data of over 1,000 ICOs \ngathered from diverse ICO information platforms, \ncoupled with a corpus of 910,478 collected tweets \nassociated with these ICOs. \n• We enhanced our understanding of human \nopinions and sentiment analysis by fine -tuning \nBidirectional Encoder Representations from \nTransformers (BERT) [9], a groundbreaking LLM, \ndistinguishing our approach from previous studies \nin ICO literature. \n• We predicted ICO success using the extracted \nsentiments and other attributes from social media \nchannels. Various machine learning models were \nexplored and compared, including SVM, logistic \nregression, an ensemble learning method, and \nseveral boosting algor ithms. SVM outperformed \nall other models. \n• We used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) \nto explain the SVM model. We found that Twitter \nand Bitcointalk data exert the greatest influence on \nICO success compared to other social channels. \nThis finding is particularly noteworthy since, to \nour best know ledge, Bitcointalk, despite its \nprominence in the cryptocurrency domain, has not \nbeen previously explored in ICO literature. \n• We demonstrate a relative increase in accuracy of \n12.5% in our designed model compared to models \ndocumented in existing literature that use social \nchannels for ICO success prediction. \n• We found that the text analysis of Bitcointalk \nforums revealed trust as the predominant emotion, \nhighlighting the importance for ICO initiators to \ncultivate investor trust to enhance token sales. \nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses \nrelated work. Section III describes the proposed \nmethodology. Section IV  presents our results. Section V \nsummarizes our work. \nII. R\nELATED WORK \nThe aim of this literature review is to outline the primary \nresearch advancements in ICO, with a particular emphasis \non social factors. Dürr et al. [10] built a predictive model \nto identify ICO fraud, compiling data on ICOs in the form \nof white-papers and implementing both natural language \nprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms. In \nsimilar context, Cerchiello et al.  [11] employed logistic \nregression and classification tree to highlight the key \naspects of an ICO that are significantly related to \nfraudulent behaviors . For this, they have analyzed a \nsample of 120 ICOs, they concluded that the absence of a \nwebsite and of the Twitter account for an ICO is a driver \nof scam activity suspect. Meoli and Vismara [12] applied \nmachine learning models along text -analysis of white -\npapers to predict the success or failure of ICOs.  \nJin et al.  [3] used social media data in addition to the \nfinancial factors collected from ICOs information platform \nJournal of Advances in Information Technology, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025\n13\nto build their logistic model that predicts the total failure \nof ICOs (i.e., the start-up could not sell any of their issued \ntokens). They calculated correlation between the existence \nor not of a given startup social channel and the ICO result. \nTheir result indicates that the existence of Twitter account \nfor a given ICO has the highest influence on ICO success, \nwhen compared with other social channels (Facebook, \nYoutube, LinkedIn, telegram, blog, and others). For \nTwitter, they merely analyzed the metadata and \nsurprisingly they found a very week correlation between \nno. of followers and no. of tweets with ICO result, after \nreviewing 400 ICO startup Twitter channels. This result \ncontradicts with Albrecht et al.’s [13] results. Specifically, \nAlbrecht et al. [13] argue that the number of people \nfollowing a blockchain startup on Twitter (Nfollowers) is \nhighly significant and positively linked to ICOs’ success \nin terms of raised volume, we find their finding persuasive. \nMoreover, they stated that the total number of  tweets \n(NTweets) is statistically significant. In addition to using \nstartups Twitter’s metadata, they have analyzed the \nsentiment of the Twitter account of the company issuing \nthe cryptographic tokens, but not the public tweets \n(opinion) regarding a given ICO. Chursook et al. [14] \nstudied ICOs from Australia and Singapore, only 87 ICOs \nwere analyzed. They employed sentiment analysis on \ntweets using the “ lexicon” package in R, a dictionary -\nbased method where sentiment is assigned based on \npredefined words. This method, reported to be less \nefficient compared to a trained classifier that is able to \ncapture contextual nuances specially the negation. The \nhighest reported accuracy was 57.7% using logistic \nregression. Chursook et al. [15] extended their work and \nadded expert ratings to the sentiment analysis, however \ntheir results are questionable, as there is a mismatch \nbetween the reported confusion matrices and their \nperformance metrics. For example, they are claiming an \naccuracy of 91.2% for Naive Bayes wh ile the \ncorresponding confusion matrix shows true positive of 22, \ntrue negative of 13, false positive of 10, and false negative \nof 12, doing the math will lead to 61.40% accuracy, this \napplies for all the other confusion matrices of the different \nmodels. \nIII. T\nHE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY \nIn this section, we discuss our proposed method as \ndepicted in Fig. 1. We start by web scraping the ICO \ninformation platform, and Twitter to get the metadata of \nstartup accounts, and the public tweets regarding each ICO \nusing the hashtag and ICO name. The collected tweets will \nbe automatically annotated to distinguish between positive \nand negative sentiments using a sentiment analysis model \nbased on BERT. This model, capable of understanding \ncontext and complex sentences, is further enhanced \nthrough a thorough preprocessing stage. This is \nparticularly crucial for unstructured short text messages, \nsuch as those found on the Twitter  platform, which pose \nseveral challenges. Among these challenges are informal \nconversational elements (e.g., repeated letters, emoticons \nand emojis) and extraneous information like noise, links, \nand user mentions. In addition to that, we scraped the \nmetadata of four other social media platforms, namely,  \nBitcoinTalk, Facebook, Telegram, and Medium. All  \ncollected data will be fed to su pervised machine learning \nmodels to be trained accordingly. Finally, we assess and \ncompare the different models. We have selected those five \nsocial media channels, as they are the most used social \nchannels in our dataset as depicted in Fig. 2. \n \n \nFig. 1. Research methodology. \n  \nFig. 2. Top five social channels used by ICOs initiators; ordered from left \nto right (The values displayed at the top of each bar represent the \npercentage of ICOs initiators that use a given social channel according to \nour dataset). \nA. Data Collection and Analysis \nOur dataset was originated from the icoholder \nwebsite  [16], an online platform providing comprehensive \ninformation on ICOs, in the version of October 2022. We \nhave built a web scraper in python using \nBeautifulsoup  [17] and Selenium  [18] libraries. Initially \nthe dataset had 10,234 token sales, next we filtered ICO \npre-sales and private sales from our sample, as we are only \ninterested in ICO main sale.  Additionally, we have \nexcluded any ICOs that failed to provide information about \ntheir project’s funding goal.  As mentioned earlier, most \nICO initiators typically disclose the soft cap and/or hard \ncap, which is not relevant to this research. \nSome ICOs report the goal in ethereum or bitcoin \ninstead of USD, so for unification, we did the exchange to \nUSD according to the exchange rate at the time of the ICO \nevent. Additionally, if icoholder.com does not provide the \nactual amount of funds collecte d for a specific ICO, we \nstrive to obtain this information from other ICO \ninformation platforms. If we are unable to find this \nJournal of Advances in Information Technology, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025\n14\ninformation, we exclude the ICO from our study. Finally, \nwe ended up with 1462 ICOs, and the attributes are: ICO \nname, start date, end date, raised fund, goal, social media \nchannels, and review (number of ICO influencers who \nreviewed a given ICO). For social media channels, ther e \nare 21 alternatives (Twitter, Telegram, Bitcointalk, \nFacebook, Medium, Youtube, Reddit, etc.). We count for \neach ICO, how many social media channels it has. Fig. 2 \nshows the top five used social channels by ICO initiators \naccording to our dataset, ordered from left to right. Where \nthe most used social channel by the different ICO initiators \nis Twitter, namely 79.96% of ICOs in our dataset have \nTwitter accounts. Hence, those five social channels are \nutilized in predicting ICO success. Regarding the output  \nvariable “success”, it is Boolean. As mentioned earlier we \nuse the goal as the success determinant. If the ICO was \nreported as scam, it was terminated for some reason, or the \nraised fund is less than the goal then we consider it as \nfailure “0”. It will be “ 1” only if the collected fund is \ngreater than or equal to the reported goal (see instruction \n1). Our dataset is balanced, i.e., 49.6% of the ICOs are \nsuccess (1), and 50.4% are failure (0). Table I presents a \ncomprehensive overview of the features  utilized in our \nprediction model that will be explained next, sourced from \nvarious social media channels, sentiment analysis, and \nICO information platforms, alongside summary statistics \n(mean, Standard  Deviation (SD), minimum, and \nmaximum). \n success = raised\nfund >= goal ? 1 : 0  (1) \nTABLE I.

We \neliminated ICOs that either lacked Twitter \naccounts or had their accounts closed or \nsuspended, resulting in a final selection of 953 \nICOs. Subsequently, we performed web scraping \nto gather metadata from their respective Twitter \naccounts, including username, display name, \nnumber of followers, number of friends \n(following), and status count. Additiona lly, in \norder to evaluate the level of community \nengagement and opinions regarding each ICO, we \nconducted three search queries on public tweets, as \nillustrated in Fig. 3. These search queries involved \nutilizing the ICO Twitter’s username both with and \nwithout the “ #” symbol, as well  as with and \nwithout the “ICO” postfix. By specifying the start \nand end dates of each ICO based on our dataset, \nwe gathered tweets related to a given ICO while it \nis taking place. The resulting tweets were stored in \nseparate CSV file for each ICO, culminating in a \ntotal of 953 CSV files, and a c orpus of 910,478 \ncollected tweets. Those collected tweets lack \nannotation, the details of sentiment analysis are \nexplained in the next subsection. \n \n \nFig. 3. Search queries used to collect public tweets about a given ICO. \nJournal of Advances in Information Technology, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025\n15\n• BitcoinTalk: is one of the earliest and most well-\nknown online forums dedicated to discussions \nabout bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It was  \ncreated by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous \ncreator of bitcoin [20]. The BitcoinTalk forum has \nspecific sections where cryptocurrency projects \ncan announce and discuss their ICOs. When an \nICO announces its project on the BitcoinTalk \nforum, the corresponding announcement thread \nbecomes a central hub for providing information \nabout the project and engaging with the \ncommunity. We have extracted some useful data \nfrom each thread of our ICOs. Fig.  4 shows the \nthread of an ICO called 0xcert, we have \nhighlighted and numbered some of the collected \ndata. We have developed a Python web scraper \nutilizing the Beautifulsoup and Selenium libraries \nto parse through the forum and extract valuable \ninformation. The first attribute that we crawled is \nthe “ number of reads” which is the number of \ntimes a particular thread has been viewed by users. \nThis metric provides an indication of the level of \ninterest or engagement the ICO thread has \ngenerated within the BitcoinTalk community. The \nsecond attribute is “ total number of pages”. Each \npage typically contains a certain number of posts, \nand as the discussion progresses, more pages are \nadded to accommodate additional contributions \nfrom forum members. The number of pages can \nprovide insights into the level of ac tivity and \nengagement within the thread. We also have \ncreated two more variables that can as well reflect \nthe activity and engagement of Bitcointalk \ncommunity. Namely, “BTCTalk total_comments” \nwhich shows how many posts are there inside the \nthread. This was calculated by parsing through all \nthe pages and  counting in each page how many \ncomments/posts are there and summing them up \nall, the maximum number of pages we had in our \ndataset is 1993. And “ BTCTalk \ntotal_Admin_Comments”, specifically tallies the \nposts r elated to the thread creator/ICO initiator. \nThis metric is utilized to demonstrate the level of \ncommitment and engagement exhibited by ICO \ninitiators in the blog, including their efforts in \nsharing updates and addressing the concerns of the \ncommunity. The last two attributes related to the \nthread creator, i.e., ICO initiator in our case, are \n“Activity” and “ Merit”. Those numbers show  the \nuser ranking and reputation in Bitcointalk forum. \nNamely, “Activity” is a measure of a user’s overall \nparticipation and contribution to the forum. \n“Merit”, on the other hand, is a measure of the \nquality and usefulness of a user’s posts, as \nperceived by other community members. Apart \nfrom gathering and computing these attributes, we \nconducted textual analysis on certain ICO threads, \nwhich will be elucidated in the following section. \n• Telegram: an account in Telegram can be a Simple \nuser, a group, or a channel, which is a one -way \ncommunication where the creator broadcasts \nmessages to the audience. For ICO Telegram \naccounts that are channels, we crawled number of \nsubscribers, photos, videos, links, and files. In \ncases where a value was unavailable, we recorded \nzero as the corresponding value. If it is a group, we \ncan only scrape number of members. However, for \nprivate groups, this information is not publicly \naccessible, resulting in the inability to retrieve it. \nFinally, if the ICO account is simple user, there is \nnothing to be scraped. Unfortunately, almost half \n(46.18%) of the ICO telegram accounts in our \ndataset are either Private Group or Simple User.  \n• Facebook: the ICO Facebook accounts are either \npages or groups. For groups, we scraped number \nof members. While for pages, number of likes, \nnumber of followers, rating, and number of \nreviewers were gathered. \n• Medium: some ICOs use the Medium platform as \na means to share informative and engaging articles \nabout their projects. For medium, we scraped \nnumber of followers for the official Medium \naccounts of ICOs. However, it is noteworthy that \nover half of the ICOs in our dataset (64.84%) do \nnot possess Medium accounts. \n \n \nFig. 4. Example of Bitcointalk thread with some important collected \nattributes. \nB. Sentiment Analysis \nSentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a \nnatural language processing technique  aimed at  \ncomputationally determining the sentiment or emotion  \nconveyed within a text. In the literature sentiment analysis \nemploys two distinct approaches: \n• Dictionary-based approach: determining sentiment \ninvolves tallying the matches between a predefined \nlist of positive and negative words and the terms \nwithin a given text source (e.g., a tweet, a sentence, \nor a paragraph). \n• Classifier-based approach: a proper classifier is \ntrained on a sufficiently large dataset with pre -\nlabeled examples, enabling it to predict the \nsentiment class of new examples. Those classifiers \ncan leverage traditional machine learning models \nor more advanced deep learning models, among \nwhich are LLM, like BERT that was pre-trained on \nvast amounts of text data and can capture complex \nrelationships within human language. \n \nDictionary-based sentiment analysis is straightforward \nand easier to interpret but lacks contextual understanding, \nleading to less accurate sentiment prediction. On the other \nhand, classifier -based methods, especially those \nleveraging advanced language models such as  BERT, \nJournal of Advances in Information Technology, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025\n16\nprovide superior accuracy and contextual comprehension \nbut are computationally intensive and require annotated \ndatasets for training. We mainly leveraged BERT model to \nautomatically annotate all of the collected tweets of each \nICO, benefiting from its exceptional performance, \nespecially given the concise nature of tweets and the \navailability of annotated Twitter datasets online. However, \nwhen dealing with longer texts in BitcoinTalk forums that \nspan multiple pages, we opted for a dictionary- based \napproach. \n \n• Twitter Textual Analysis: We employed the BERT \nmodel to the collected tweets, as detailed in our \nprevious publication [21]. Where, given the \ninherent noise and peculiarities in Twitter data, we \nintroduced an enhanced pre-processing phase. This \nphase involved tasks such as data cleaning, \nremoval of user mentions, as well as handling \nemoticons and emojis. Additionally, we conducted \ncomprehensive training and comparison \nexperiments, encompassing both traditional \nmachine learning models and BERT. Among \nthese, the BERT models demonstrated outstanding \nperformance attaining an accuracy ranging from \n92.92% to 94%. Consequently, we preserved the \ntrained model and applied it in the current study. \nConcretely, we applied the recommended \npreprocessing techniques outlined in [21] to the \ngathered tweets. Additionally, in this study, we \nintroduced an additional step, utilizing the Google \nTranslate API to render non- English tweets into \nEnglish. Due to the presence of non -English \ntweets, and as our sentiment analysis model was  \ntrained on English data, translation was \nimperative. Following the completion of the pre -\nprocessing phase, we proceeded to employ the \npretrained BERT model for the automatic \nannotation of each collected tweet. This entire \nprocedure was iterated for every tweet across the \n953 CSV files. After annotation, we have acquired \nthree attributes from each file for each ICO. \nNamely, number of positive tweets, number of \nnegative tweets, and total number of collected \ntweets. Where, for “ number of positive tweets” \nattribute, we have counted in every CSV file how \nmany tweets were auto -annotated as positive “ 1”, \nsimilar task was done for “ number of negative \ntweets” but this time counting the negative tweets \n(label 0). Regarding “ total number of collected \ntweets” attribute is just the summation of the two \nattributes. \n• Bitcointalk Textual Analysis: To analyze the text \nof Bitcointalk forums using dictionary -based \nmodel, we employed three  vocabularies from the \nR package “tidytext” : AFINN [22], BING [23], \nand NRC Emotional Lexicon [24]. These three \nlexicons are based on unigrams (bag of words). \nWhere AFINN lexicon is a list of English words \neach assigned a numerical sentiment score ( −5 to \n5). Where negative scores impl y negative \nsentiment and vice  versa. The BING lexicon \ncategorizes words in a binary fashion into positive \nand negative. However, The NRC Emotional \nLexicon contains words annotated with their \nassociation to eight basic emotions (anger, \nanticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, \nand trust). \nC. Supervised Machine Learning Models \nTo identify the optimal model for predicting ICO \nsuccess, we have investigated various machine learning \nclassifiers. We started with exploring the Naive  Bayes \n(NB) model, a linear probabilistic model based on Bayes’ \ntheorem [25], as a baseline model. Subsequently, we \nexamined Decision Trees (DT) [26] and evaluated Logistic \nLR [27] as a generalized linear model. The optimization \nalgorithm used in LR is Lim ited-memory Broyden–\nFletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno “LBFGS” solver, to prevent \noverfitting, we have used L2 penalty as the regularization \ntechnique. Additionally, we explored SVM , a non -\nprobabilistic linear model capable of solving both linear \nand non-linear problems [28]. We employed a linear kernel \nfor SVM and set the regularization parameter (C) to “1” . \nWe also considered Random Forest (RF) [29], an ensemble \nlearning method that combines multiple decision trees and \nuses voting to determine the final prediction. The number \nof trees in the forest (n_estimators) is set to “100”. Lastly, \nwe evaluated two boosting algorithms [30], namely \nAdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC). \nBoosting algorithms combines multiple weak models to \ncreate a stronger model, by iteratively correcting the \nmistakes or misclassifications made by previous models. \nFor Adaboost, we set the maximum number of estimators \n(n_estimators) to “100” and the learning rate to “1”, using \nthe Stagewise Additive Modeling using a Multiclass \nExponential (SAMME) algorithm, which is a discrete \nboosting method. For GBC, we configured the \nhyperparameters as follows: the number of boosting stages \n(n_estimators) is set to “ 80”, the learning rate is “1” , and \nthe maximum tree depth (max_depth) is set to “1” . It is \nworth mentioning that we have explored some deep \nlearning models, namely Convolutional Neural Network  \n(NN), Radial Basis Function (RBF) NN, and Multilayer \nPerceptron (MLP) NN. However, their results were not \npromising, that is why they weren’t reported in the results \nsection. To assess the performance of the used models, we \nsplit the dataset into an 80% training set and a 20% testing \nset. Our finalized dataset has 953 ICOs. The used attributes \nare as mentioned previously, refer to Table I. Precisely, \nsocial media channels, review, ICO duration in days (this \nwas calculated using end date and start date). Twitter \nrelated data: No. of followers, No. of friends, status count, \nNo. of positive tweets, No. of negative tweets, and total \nnumber of collected tweets. Bitcointalk related data: \nnumber_pages, number_reads, author Merit, author \nActivity, total Admin Comments, and total comments. \nTelegram related data: No. of members, photos, videos, \nlinks, and files. Facebook data: No. of likes, followers, \nrating, and No. of reviewers. Finally, No. of followers of \nMedium. Any feature/column that has more than half \nmissing values, was dropped. We have also introduced \nfour dummy variables to signify the presence of the most \nJournal of Advances in Information Technology, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025\n17\nfrequently used social media channels in ICOs —\nFacebook, Telegram, Bitcointalk, and Medium. A dummy \nvariable for Twitter was omitted since all 953 ICOs in our \nfinalized dataset already have Twitter accounts. \nIV. R\nESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nAf\nter creating the features for the classification models \nand choosing the suitable machine learning models, we \ndetermine the performance metrics tailored to the specific \nproblem. Accuracy (expressed by Eq.  ( 2)), an oft -cited \nmetric for classification evaluation, reflects the percentage \nof correctly assigned class labels. Precision, recall, and F1-\nScore are other commonly used metrics [31]. Where \nprecision (expressed by Eq.  (3)) focuses on the accuracy \nof positive predictions, indicating the proportion of \ncorrectly predicted positive instances out of all instances \npredicted as positive. In contrast, recall (Eq. (4)) also \nknown as sensitivity emphasizes the model’s ability to \ncapture all positive instances, indicating the proportion of \ncorrectly predicted positive instances out of all actual \npositive instances. Precision  evaluates the accuracy of \npositive predictions, while recall evaluates the \ncomprehensiveness of positive predictions. F1 -Score \n(Eq.  ( 5)), a harmonic means  of precision and recall, \nbalances both metrics and is beneficial for evaluating \noverall model performance, particularly in imbalanced \ndatasets. In Eq. (2)– Eq. (5) [31], TP, TN, FP, and FN \nrepresent “True Positive”, “True Negative”, “False \nPositive”, and “False Negative”, respectively. We let  \n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 =  𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 +  𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 +  𝐹𝐹\n𝑇𝑇 +  𝐹𝐹𝑇𝑇. \n accuracy =  \n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 +𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇\n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 (2) \n precision =  \n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇\n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 +𝐹𝐹𝑇𝑇\n (3) \n recall =  \n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇\n𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 +𝐹𝐹𝑇𝑇\n (4) \n F1 −Score =  \n2×Precision×Recall\nPrecision+Recall\n (5) \nTABLE II. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED MACHINE \nLEARNING MODELS ON THE TEST DATASET \nModel Accuracy Precision Recall F1-Score \nNB 54.45% 68.00% 32.38% 43.87% \nDT 55.50% 60.00% 57.14% 58.54% \nLR 63.35% 68.42% 61.90% 65.00% \nSVM 64.92% 64.84% 79.05% 71.24% \nRF 62.83% 67.35% 62.86% 65.02% \nAdaBoost 59.69% 66.28% 54.29% 59.69% \nGBC 59.69% 63.92% 59.05% 61.39% \n \nThe results are presented in Table II, which compares \nthe performance of the seven ML models on the test \ndataset. The model with the lowest performance was the \nbaseline model (NB), with an F1-Score of 43.87%. On the \nother hand, the SVM model had the best performance, with \nan F1-Score of 71.24%. Following SVM, LR and RF as an \nensemble learning method, both exhibited relatively good \nperformance with F1 -Scores of 65%. The obtained \naccuracy of SVM is sufficient for a preliminary \nassessment, especially when compared with [14] , where \nour designed model demonstrates a relative increase in \naccuracy of 12.5%. However, we suggest that further \nresearch is needed with other factors like team members, \nwhite-papers, and others to determine if t he accuracy will \nimprove by customising the training model of the machine \nlearning platforms. Inevitably though, insights regarding \nthe success of ICOs can be derived by examining text \nanalysis and other social factors as will be shown next. \nA. Model Interpretation \nThe decision function of an SVM involves complex \ncalculations in high- dimensional spaces, making it  less \nintuitive to interpret and find the feature importance within \nthe model. Thus, we have employed SHAP, a state-of-the-\nart tool capable of reliably computing and visualizing the \nimpact of features on the output of a machine learning \nmodel based on game theory [32]. It aims to provide \ninsights into the contribution of each input feature to the \nmodels’ predictions, helping to shed light on the black-box \nmodel’s behavior. To get an oversight of the most \nimportant features for our model, we depict the SHAP \nvalues of the most influential features in our dataset in \nFig.  5.  \n \n \nFig. 5. SHAP bar plot shows the magnitude of top 10 features’ effect, \nsorted by feature importance. \nUsing SHAP bar plot (Fig. 5), “ BTCTalk \nnumber_reads” was identified as the most important \npredictor of ICO success,  reflecting the ICO initiators’ \nability to attract a substantial audience to read or engage in \nthe forum. This finding is in concordance  with the results \nof [13], where they showed that the number of people \nfollowing a blockchain startup on Twitter (Nfollowers) is \nhighly significant and positively linked to ICOs’ success. \nThe two attributes “ BTCTalk number_reads”, and \nNfollowers reflect the ove rall effectiveness of a \ncompany’s social media marketing strategy. No. of pages, \nand total comments of Bitcointalk, along with the No. of \npositive tweets stand out as key features among the top \nfive. These attributes signify societal engagement and \npositive feedback concerning ICO initiators. In essence, a \nhigher level of community engagement with extensive \ncomments and positive tweets correlates with an increased \nlikelihood of ICO success. It is worth highlighting that \nwithin the top ten important features , only data associated \nwith Twitter and Bitcointalk is present, underscoring the \nsignificance of these social channels in comparison to \nJournal of Advances in Information Technology, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2025\n18\nFacebook, Telegram, and Medium. This observation is \nfurther validated by the dummy variables, with only the \npresence of Bitcointalk proving significant. As mentioned \nearlier, no dummy variable was employed for Twitter as \nall ICOs in our finalized dataset have Twitter accounts. \nThis finding is especially significant because, to our best \ninformation, Bitcointalk, despite its significance in the \ncryptocurrency domain, has not been previously examined \nin ICO literature. This is a call for researchers i n ICO \nliterature to conduct further analysis of the Bitcointalk \nforum. \nB. Bitcointalk Textual Analysis \nFurther analysis has been conducted on the textual part \nof Bitcointalk forum as detailed in Section III-B. For the \nsake of simplicity and readability we report an example of \nICO for each category: Aeternum as an illustration of a \nsuccessful ICO, and Shamrock as an illustration of failure. \nFigs. 6 and 7 compare the most frequent positive and \nnegative words in the success and failed ICOs respectively. \nIt is notable that the proportion of positive words (refer to \nthe percentage) is more than the negative ones in the \nsuccess ICO, the opposite is true in the failed one. \nMoreover, we have calculated the average sentiment score \nbased on AFINN vocabularies, 1.08 and 0.4 were the \nscores for success and failed ICOs, respectively. It appears \nevident that the successful ICO has a higher score than the \nfailed one. The most three  dominant emotions for the \nsuccess ICO according to NRC Emotional Lexicon, were \ntrust, anticipation and joy. For the failed ICO, trust, fear, \nand sadness were the  most appearing ones. This is \nenlightening for the ICO initiators where they should gain \nthe trust of the investors in order to sell more tokens. \nMoreover, it is observable that negative feelings were tied \nwith failed ICO, and happy emotions in the successful \nICO. \n \n \nFig. 6. Success ICO (Aeternum), most frequent positive and negative \nwords. \n \nFig. 7. Failed ICO (Shamrock), most frequent positive and negative \nwords. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we address the issue of discovering the \nsocial success drivers of an ICO. For this purpose, we have \nscraped and mined financial and ICOs’ social media data, \nnamely, Twitter, BitcoinTalk, Telegram, Facebook, and \nMedium. We proposed a combined  approach based on \nclassification models and textual analysis to highlight \nsignificant attributes in distinguishing success from failure \nICOs. Precisely, we leveraged BERT, an advanced \nlanguage model, to enhance sentiment analysis of \ncollected public tweet s to grasp people opinion toward \neach ICO, along other attributes collected from different \nsocial media were fed to different machine learning \nmodels. SVM has outperformed other models. To interpret \nand elucidate the work of SVM model, we employed the \nSHAP tool for conducting feature importance analysis. We \nfound that the primary social channels associated with the \nsuccess of ICOs are Twitter and Bitcoinalk. Further \nanalysis has been conducted on the textual part of \nBitcointalk forum, where we have illustrated that more \nnegative words appear with high frequency in failed ICO \ncompared to a successful one. This trend is is further \nconfirmed by a sentiment score calculated using AFFIN \nvocabulary. Moreover, we studied the emotions in \nBitcointalk, the most three dominating emotions found in \nthe success ICO were trust, anticipation, and joy. For the \nfailed ICO, trust, fear, and sadness were the most \nappearing ones. \nC\nONFLICT OF INTEREST \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \nKhouloud Safi ElJil formulated the research question, \ndesigned the methodology, collected and analyzed the \ndata, conducted experiments, and interpreted the results. \nShe also performed a thorough literature review and took \nthe lead in drafting the manuscript, incorporating feedback \nfrom the advisors (Dr. Essia Hamouda, and Prof. Farid \nNait-Abdessalam) and addressing reviewer comments. \nThe advisors provided guidance, intellectual input, \nsupervision, and critical feedback, helping refine the \nresearch objectives, edit the manuscript, and secure \nnecessary resources.
