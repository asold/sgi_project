INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, the wireless power transfer (WPT)\ntechnologies have been the growing hot t opics for\nresearchers. WPT applications can be found in a wide range\nfrom implanted biomedical devices, consumer electronics '\nchargers and vehicle battery charges [1] –[3]. Among WPT\ntechnologies, the magnetic resonance coupling method has a\nbetter promise because of its long transfer distance and high\nefficiency [1], [4]. MIT groups experimentally demonstrated\nthis power transfer method over distances up to 8 times the\nradius of the coils. A 60 watts bulb was lighted over distances\nof more than two meters [5], [6].\nFor magnetic resonance coupling WPT systems, when\nmoving the two coils to be close step by step and when they\nare close enough, the power transferred to load drop sharply.\nThis is because the resonant frequency has been changed\nwhen the coupling o f coils becomes strong er. This\nphenomenon is called frequency splitting which is defined\nand explained in [ 7], [8]. When the coupling between the\nManuscript received April 10, 2013; accepted September 25, 2013.\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Fund of China\n(51277120) and ITER Special Project (2011GB113005). This work is also\nsupported by State Energy Smart Grid R&D Center (China, Shanghai).\ntransmitter coil and receiver coil increases and is greater than\na critical frequency, the resonance frequency will split into\ntwo resonant frequencies, the odd frequency and the even\nfrequency; thus, the load voltage will change from a\nsingle-peak curve to a double-peak curve. Frequency splitting\nis an important issue, related to the power transfer efficiency\nand capability of WPT systems. Works about frequencies\nsplitting were reported widely based on coupling mode theory\n(CMT) and circuit theory [ 9]–[15]. In [ 7], the directional\ncoupler-based method was suggested to track the splitting\nfrequency in a magnetic re sonance system. Reference [1 6]\napplied a root locus method to explain the double\nvoltage-peak of frequency splitting of WPT systems. In [17],\nan asymptotic coupled mode theory method has been used to\nanalyse the frequency splitting phenomena in contactless\npower transfer systems. The critical coupling coefficient has\nbeen derived based on the energy equations. In [18], an exact\nanalysis about frequency splitting of the symmetrical and\nunsymmetrical contactless power transfer systems is shown in\ndetail. However, related reports based on CMT [ 5], [6], [17]\npresented by physicist s cannot be underst ood well by\nresearchers of electrical engineering. On the other hand, lots\nof research just shows the phenomena of frequency splitting\nwith double-peak characteristic of output power curve\n[9]–[14]; the studies seldom give detailed analysison how the\nsplitting frequency change s, what the even and odd\nfrequencies are a nd what the relationship of the splitting\nfrequency to main circuit parameters is.\nIn this work, first , a simple T -type transformer model is\nintroduced to analyse the magnetic coupling WPT system.\nThen, the odd frequency and even frequency are determined\nusing simple equations by the impedance analysis of T -type\ntransformer model. Then, a n analysis about f requency\nsplitting based on simulation is also presented.At last, a WPT\nprototype is constructed. The driver of a WPT system is\nimportant concerning the efficiency of a WPT system . Here,\nwe used the half-bridge inverter to drive the source coil. The\nzero voltage switching condition is discussed as well. Then,\nthe experimental results validate the theoretical analysis.This\npaper is organized as following. In Section II the methods are\npresented. In Section III, the analysis based on the\nexperimental result s is given . Finally, the discussion and\nconclusions are given in the Section IV.\nFrequency Splitting Analysis of Wireless Power\nTransfer System Based on T-type Transformer\nModel\nLan Jianyu1, Tang Houjun1, Gen Xin1\n1Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University,\nDongchuan Rd.

ANALYSIS\nThe schematic diagram of the experimental WPT system is\nshown in Fig. 4 .

WPT system based on half-bridge inverter.\nIn Fig. 4, the MOSFET switches S1 and S2 are driven\nalternatively with 50 % duty cycle, an d the square wave\nvoltage is produced at the mid-node (point N in the Fig. 4.) of\nthe half-bridge inverter. The capacitor C1, C2 and the two coils\nform a resonant tank are shown within the dash line. In the\nresonant tank, only sinusoidal current is allowed to flow\nthrough because the network filters harmonic currents. The\ncurrents in source coil and device coil are with the same\nfrequency. So the two coils resonate with each other. Thus,\nthe energy transfer s from source coil to device coil. In\naddition, t his experimental setup uses two identical coils\nshown in Fig. 5. The litz wire is used to manufacture the coils\nbecause of its low series resistor under high frequency\noperation. The key parameter values are listed in Table II.\nFig. 5.

Zero Voltage Switching\nTo acquire the maximum transfer power, the WPT system\nshould operate in high frequency, normally more than 1 MHz.\nBut, when improving operational frequency, the efficiency\nwill drop. Therefore the zero voltage switching (ZVS) in a\nWPT system must be ensured . The system work ing under\ninductive region can realize the ZVS of MOSFETs in\nvoltage-source half-bridge inverter. However, the assumption\nof working under inductive region is just a necessary\ncondition for ZVS but not sufficient. This is because the\nparasitic capacitance of the MOSFETs needs energy to be\ncharged and discharged during one switching peri od. To\nallow ZVS, a dead timeTdead is inserted between theend of the\nON-time of a switch and beginning of the ON-time of another\none. To ensure discharging the energy of parasitic capacitance\ncompletely, the dead time Tdead should be large r than the\ndischarging time Tdis\ndead dis .T T  (20)\nThe discharging time Tdis can be expressed by (21)\n1\n(2 ) .

When current passes through diodes, the voltage\nof MOSFETs is clamped to zero. If parasitic capacitance has\nbeen discharged completely during the dead time zone, the\nZVS can achieve what is shown in Fig. 7(b).\nB. Frequency Splitting\nThe load voltage is measured to demonstrate the frequency\nsplitting phenomena. We slowly move the device coil to be\nclose to the source coil step by step, and in each step the\noperation frequency sweeps from 500 kHz to 2 MHz. Then,\nthe voltage gain of load is recorded at each step.

When coupling increases,\nfrequency splitting phenomena appear. The critical splitting\ncoupling is around k = 0.015. The load voltage shows a\nsingle-peak curve in the region k < 0.015; when k increases\nand is greater thank < 0.015, the load voltage curve splits into\ntwo curves, and the greater the coupling k, the greater the gap\nbetween the odd frequency andthe even frequency. As shown\nin Fig. 6, the experimental results consist with the theoretical\nvalues with slight differences.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe frequency bifurcation is discussed frequently in\ninductively coupled power transfer (ICPT) system which has\nsome same characteristics, but they are different. Frequency\nbifurcation phenomena are the input characteristics of an\nICPT system, while frequency splitting phenomena concerns\nthe output characteristics of WPT systems, although they\noften appear at the same time.To let the imaginary part of the\ninput impedance to be zero is to define the frequency\nbifurcation. Bifurcation phenomena are related to the study of\n112\nELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA, ISSN 1392-1215, VOL. 19, NO. 10, 2013\nthe system stability of a WPT system. There are some stability\nregions and instability region s in a WPT system with\nbifurcation. Every operating region has different transfer\ncharacteristics.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nFrequency splitting phenomena in WPT systems are\nstudied by an electric circuit model method. A simple T-type\ntransformer model is introduced. With impedance analysis,\nthe even and odd splitting frequencies have been derived. In\naddition, the simulation by the aid of computer shows the\noutput characteristic of frequency splitting. Furthermore, the\nhalf-bridge inverter is cons tructed to drive the WPT system.\nThe ZVS conditions are discussed as well. Finally, the\ntheoretical results are validated by the experimental results.\nThe control method is proposed as well.\nREFERENCES\n[1] K. Wu, D. Choudhury, H.
