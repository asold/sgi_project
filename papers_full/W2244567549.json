They are vital assets as part of the \nelectric power generating facilities worldwide. \nThe demand for electricity is continuously growing, thus \nresulting in a significant number of power transformers in \nservice and being installed. Properly designed power \ntransformers have an average service life of 25 to 35 years \ndepending on loading, temperatures and maintenance. There \nare cases where power transformers with adequate \nmaintenance can reach a lifespan of around 60 years [1]. \nHowever, several large power transformers built during the \n60’s and 70’s are considered to be close to the end of their \ndesign life.  From this perspective, it is necessary to develop \naccurate and reliable tools to assess and predict the evolution \nand remaining lifespan of power transformers and to avoid \nfailures of old units with the resulting consequences. \nThese days, even with the continuous advance in power \ntransformer control, automation and design, the general \nconfiguration of large power transformers, including their \ncomponents and materials, remains almost unaltered from the \nfirst commercial versions. With respect to the transformer \ninsulation system, inexpensive paper, pressboard and oil \ncontinue to be used as the elements that make up that part of \nthe transformer. Oil impregnated paper has good electrical and \nmechanical properties which favor its use as insulating \nmaterial. Its good dielectric strength is not affected even when \nthe paper loses some of its mechanical performance [2]. \nManuscript received on 6 May 2015, in final form 4 August 2015, \naccepted 13 August 2015. \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 22, No. 6; December 2015\n3625\nDOI: 10.1109/TDEI.2015.005386\n \nMultiple factors influence the lifespan of power \ntransformers (electrical, mechanical and thermal stresses). \nThese factors interact with the components of the insulation \nsystem, accelerating the normal aging of the oil and paper. \nFortunately, the oil can be reclaimed or eventually changed \nwhen necessary without stopping the operation of the \ntransformer.  \nHowever, the solid part of the insulation system (paper and \npressboard) cannot be monitored or changed once the \ntransformer is built. For this reason, paper composed mainly of \npure cellulose is one of the most critical constraints for \npredicting and assessing the power transformer’s remaining \nservice life. Therefore, the lifespan of the solid insulation is \nparticularly related to the overall effectiveness of the actual \ntransformer.   \nPaper is basically a mat of cellulose fibers composed of \nbundles of cellulose molecules joined by hydrogen bonds that \nconnect hydroxyl (-OH) groups among adjacent cellulose \nmolecules. The cellulose molecule consists of a linear chain of \nglucose molecules joined by glycosidic bonds [3]. \nPaper is an anisotropic fibrous structure that has different \nregions (amorphous and crystalline) with different \nmorphologies. This diversity produces variations during the \nmeasurement of mechanical properties. The mechanical \nstrength of cellulose paper is a combination of different \nfactors:  the strength of the fibers (cellulose fibers and fibrils) \nand the strength of the fiber-to-fiber bonds. These interfiber \nbonds are arranged by the remaining lignin and hemicellulose \nthat compose the paper. Based on these factors, the failure \nmechanics of paper develop through the following two tracks: \nthe interfiber bonds fail in a weak bonded paper or individual \nfibers fail in a strongly bonded paper [4].  \nThe pulp and paper industry is focused on bringing a \nfinal paper product with the most homogeneous \ncharacteristics, even if the paper is a porous, anisotropic \nmaterial with an inhomogeneous structure. Nevertheless, at \nthe macroscopic level, paper appears to be a continuous and \nordered material.  \nAt the molecular level, paper consists of an intricate and \ncomplex group of cellulosic fibers bound together by \nhydrogen bonds. During the manufacture of paper, local \nvariations in the grammage (paper density), fiber \norientation distribution, pore distribution and interfiber \nstrength (bonded area among individual cellulose fibers) \nproduce zones denoted as mesostructures. The \nmesostructures are niches where the paper will start to fail \nunder mechanical stress [4].  \nThis local effect needs to be added to the normal \ndeterioration suffered by the cellulose fibers and interfibre \nbonding due to typical aging that affects the paper. In \nsummary, the values obtained from the measurement of paper \nstrength are averages.  In contrast, the rupture of the paper is \nnot controlled by the average values but by lower values \ndetected in a specific region due to the local variations \nmentioned above [4].   \nMany studies have been reported that explore the \nprogression of normal aging of the oil-paper insulation system. \nAlthough the aging of paper in oil is not yet fully understood, \nsome of the mechanisms involved in the aging process have \nbeen described in the literature. Oxidation, thermal degradation \nand acid hydrolysis degrade or depolymerize cellulose \nsimultaneously during the entire aging event. Among them, \nacid hydrolysis is considered to be the main mechanism \nresponsible for cellulose aging [5].  \n Among the tools used to assess the condition of paper is the \nmeasurement of the degree of polymerization (DP\nv, average \nnumber of glucose units per cellulose chain). This technique is \naccurate in evaluating the condition of paper. The mechanical \nstrength of paper is related to the average DPv. For new Kraft \npaper, DP v ranging from 1300-1000 is measured; the \nmechanical strength is considered constant between 1000 and \n500. After the DPv drops to 500, the strength and DPv decrease \nto show a linear relationship [2]. When the DP v values are \nbetween 200 and 150, the paper cannot withstand additional \nmechanical stress (e.g vibration inside the transformer), even \nwhen its dielectric strength has not degraded. At this point the \npaper and the transformer itself are at high risk of experiencing \na total failure.  \nUnfortunately, the main limitation of this technique is \nobtaining paper samples from an operating transformer. As a \nresult of this situation, there are other indirect methods for \nmonitoring the condition of paper. Dissolved gas analysis \n(DGA) is used to measure the concentration of carbon oxides \ngenerated by cellulose degradation. However, the generation of \ncarbon oxides is not specific to cellulose since the long-term \noxidation of oil also produces them [6]. Another current \ntechnique is the analysis of furanic composites. After a \ncomplex process, the glucose molecule, which is not soluble in \noil, degrades into different types of furan derivatives. Some of \nthese are available to be used as chemical markers based on \ntheir polarity and solubility in oil. 2-furaldehyde (2-FAL) is a \nspecific furan chemical marker of cellulose degradation. A \nhigh concentration of 2-FAL indicates a high level of \ndegradation in paper. However, some disadvantages of 2-FAL \nare its low sensitivity in the aging of thermally upgraded (TU) \npaper (more often used by new transformers), along with its \nexponential behavior. The 2-FAL concentration in oil shows a \nnoticeable increase only with the extreme aging of paper (DPv \n≤ 400) [13]. \nIn an effort to overcome these drawbacks, other chemical \nmarkers are being investigated. Methanol, which is found in \noil, is an excellent aging marker for standard Kraft and TU \npapers. The generation of methanol is proportional to the \nscissions of the glycosidic bonds in the cellulose chain. Based \non methanol levels, the condition of the paper can be tracked at \nevery stage, from the initial state of aging to the end. Also, a \nrelationship between the concentration of methanol in oil and \nthe DP\nv of aged paper within the transformer has recently been \nreported [7]. In the case of ethanol, its generation is related to a \nspecific fault in the paper, such as a hot spot. However, even \nthough DPv is an excellent tool for assessing the condition of \ncellulose fibers in paper at the molecular level, no relationship \nhas been found between the analysis of chemical markers and \nthe ultimate mechanical properties of the paper; i.e. no macro \nscale analysis has been performed. \n3626\nO. H. Arroyo et al.: Relationships between Methanol Marker and Mechanical Performance of Electrical Insulation Paper\n \nIn the present work, two different types of papers, standard \nKraft and TU Kraft paper, were studied under an accelerated \naging protocol. In both cases, the levelling-off degree of \npolymerization (LODP), which corresponds to the length of \nthe crystalline region (crystallite), was reached in order to \nobtain a full picture of paper aging. The relationship between \nthe alcohol markers, DP\nv and the mechanical properties of the \noil-impregnated paper sample are presented.  \n2  AGING CELL SETUP \n2.1 MATERIALS \nIn this study, the following materials were used to prepare \nthe aging cells: \nInhibited iso-paraffin synthesized insulating fluid Luminol \nTR/TR-I (Luminol), by Petro-Canada, with an initial acidity of \n0.001 mg KOH/g, was used to impregnate the paper samples. \nDue to a specific refining process, Luminol has a higher \noxidation stability that produces less acidity than other mineral \noils [8]. In addition, Luminol meets the Type I to IV \nperformance requirements as required by the norm CSA C50-\n08 for oxidation stability. \nThe characteristics of the Munksjö (standard Kraft) and \nRotherm (TUK) papers that were studied are presented in \nTable 1. \nTable 1. Physical properties of the studied papers. \nName Munksjö EG Rotherm CE \nManufacturer Munksjö AB Tullis Russel  \nType Kraft (5A2-1H1) Kraft TUK(Insuldur) \nGrammage (g/m2) 40 62 \nThickness (μm) 50 75 \nN2 (%) 0.04 1.15 \nH2O (%)  1.25 0.96 \nDPv,o (Initial DPv) 1222 1048 \nLODP  159 179 \n \nThe paper samples were cut into 25.4 mm x 130 mm strips \nusing a twin-blade cutter (TMI brand).  \nHomemade paper holders were used to keep the paper \nsamples free of folds during the aging process. They were \nmade using magnetic copper wire (type HF, AWG 14) to form \ncoils and copper tubing (3.17 mm OD, 2.41 mm ID) to create \nthe rest of the holder. Paper samples (13 per holder) were \nplaced between the coil turns to allow oil to flow freely among \nthe samples (Figure 1).    \n \nFigure 1.  Aging cell and copper holder with paper samples. \nThe aging cells were created using assembly nipple spools, \nused for ultra-high vacuum applications (304L stainless steel \ncylindrical tube (diam. of 47 mm x 163 mm) from Kurt J. \nLesker). In addition, the cells were made of two stainless steel \nvacuum flanges, two copper gaskets with a set of bolt and nuts \n(closed manually and then with a torque wrench) to close both \nsides. This setup (Figure 1) ensures hermeticity at high \ntemperatures and prevents gas leakage from the aging cells [9].  \nThe mass distribution of the materials inside the aging cells is \npresented in Table 2. \n \nTable 2. Mass distribution of materials in aging cells \nName Munksjö EG Rotherm CE \nPaper (g) 1.85 2.70  \nOil (g) 225 225 \nCopper (g) 55 55 \nRatio Oil/Paper 121.6 83.3 \n \n2.2 SAMPLES CONDITIONING AND AGING \nCONDITIONS  \nBoth the paper and the oil were conditioned to equilibrium \nwith dry air at 0.9% relative humidity (RH) inside a double \nglove box (Vacuum Atmosphere Company, model VTB \n15x24) at 20.8°C before being introduced into the aging cells. \nThe holders with the paper strips were placed in the \nantechamber of a double glove box under vacuum atmosphere \nand at 40°C for 48 hours. This first step of the drying process \nreduces the original relative humidity (RH) of the paper from \nmore than 1% RH to less than 0.5% RH. The paper samples \nwere then moved from the antechamber to the glove box itself. \nThere, the paper specimens were conditioned to reach the \nnominal 0.9% RH for at least one week. However, the absolute \nwater content (%) was measured at the start of the aging \nexperiments (see Table 1) according to ASTM D3277. \nA glass bottle containing Luminol was also conditioned \nunder constant agitation (via a magnetic stirrer) at atmospheric \npressure in the glove box for at least 24 hours. When the oil \nand paper reached the required equilibrium, the stainless steel \naging cells were introduced into the glove box. The holder \nwith the paper specimens and 270 mL of oil (using a pipette) \nwere added to each cell. An air blanket was left in the cell to \ncompensate for the thermal expansion of the oil. The aging \ncells at air atmosphere were closed inside the glove box to \navoid introducing external sources of humidity. \nThe stainless steel aging cells were placed inside an air-\nforced oven (Salvis lab, type tc-100s), and the temperature \nwas maintained at 170 °C during aging. The cells were \nremoved at different times for analysis. They were then \ncooled and maintained at 17 °C for 24 hours before \nextracting the oil aliquots for analysis. Once opened, the \ncells were not returned to the oven. The temperature of \n170°C was selected because quick degradation would be \nnoticed in paper. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the \ndegradation is governed by a single reaction pattern, and the \nsame mechanism and behavior of degradation of laboratory \naging from 70 to 210 °C [10]. Therefore the use of \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 22, No. 6; December 2015\n3627\n \naccelerated aging test at a hi gh temperature, 170 °C, is \neffective for estimating the insulation condition of normal \noperating transformers. An advantage of this new aging cell \nconsists in an improvement in hermeticity tested at high \ntemperatures. This closure,  which prevents air from \nentering and the loss of volatile compounds, was an issue \nwhen glass aging cells were used in a preliminary aging \nstudy [9]. \n2.3 ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES \nThe following analysis and measurements were performed: \n2.3.1 CHEMICAL MARKERS \nAlcohol markers (methanol and ethanol) were analyzed \nusing headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometry \ndetection A comprehensive description of the method is \navailable at Jalbert et al. 2012 [11]. Oil aliquots (10 mL) were \ntaken immediately after opening the aging cells to avoid the \nloss of volatile compounds. \n2.3.2 OIL ACIDITY AND WATER CONTENT \nOil samples were analyzed to measure the neutralization \nnumber by titration according to ASTM D974 and to measure \nthe water content in oil by coulometric Karl Fischer titration \naccording to ASTM D1533. \n2.3.3 TENSILE INDEX OF THE PAPER \nThe pulp and paper industries have adopted the concept of \nstandard tensile strength for measuring the inherent strength of \npaper in order to evaluate end products for different \napplications. The tensile index (Tidx) is one of the standards \nused to measure the inherent mechanical properties of paper. \nThe Tidx measures the force at break per unit of the width of \npaper divided by the specimen grammage. The grammage of \npaper (in g/m\n2) is its density, i.e., its mass divided by a square \nmeter of paper.  \nThe tensile strength test was performed using ASTM D828 \ndesigned to assess the tensile strength of paper and pressboard \nat a constant elongation rate. The specific parameters needed to \nperform the test are listed in ASTM D828. The values used \nwere for a specimen with a width of 25.4 mm and effective \nspecimen length (grip separation at start of test) of 50 mm. A \nvalue of 50 mm was chosen instead of 100 mm to avoid an \nedge effect. The paper sample has two holes at each extremity \nfor the copper holders. The nominal specimen length was 130 \nmm while the rate of grip separation during test was set to 7 \nmm/min. \nThirteen paper samples per aging point were measured; at \nleast eight validated quantities were used to obtain an average \nvalue. The other values were rejected due to local failure and \nconditions from ASTM D828.  \nThe tensile index of the specimen was measured using a \ntension tester machine (Testing Machine Inc Series 84-76). \nBefore testing, the papers were de-oiled using a bath of \ndistillated hexane, after which the papers were conditioned \nunder air at room temperature (21 °C) inside a laboratory hood \nfor at least 48 hours.   \n2.3.4 VISCOSIMETRIC DEGREE OF \nPOLYMERIZATION \nAfter the measurement of the tensile index, the remaining \npaper samples were collected and shredded to measure their \ndegree of polymerization. The average viscometric degree of \npolymerization is based on ASTM D4243. Two measurements \nper analyzed point were performed to obtain an average value.    \n3  RESULTS  AND DISCUSSIONS \nVisual observation of the samples showed a change in color \nfrom an original light brown typical of Kraft papers to a dark \nbrown color at the end of the aging. The software package \n\"Curve Expert Professional v. 1.6.8\" was used for curve fitting.  \nFigure 2 shows the evolution of the degree of \npolymerization and methanol concentration with the aging \ntime for both types of paper. The aging duration for the \nstandard Kraft and TUK papers was 784 and 1288 hours \nrespectively for reaching their LODP values.   \nThe DPv of the TUK paper decreased slower than for the \nstandard Kraft paper due to the presence of the nitrogen \ncontaining thermally upgrading agent that slows down the \naging mechanism. However, at a longer aging time, both \npapers reached a similar level of DP\nv values.  \nThe absolute values of the methanol concentration in the oil \nof cells containing TUK paper were higher than the values for \nthe standard Kraft paper. This large difference occurred \nbecause the generation of methanol is directly proportional to \nthe number of scissions in the cellulose chains. In the case of \nthe TUK paper, its grammage or density is 50% greater than \nthe standard Kraft paper; thus, more cellulose chains were \naccessible to be broken and to produce methanol molecules. \nTo overcome this disparity, the methanol concentration values \nwere normalized by their respective paper grammage, as \nshown in the figure. In addition, the differences in methanol \nconcentrations can be explained by the partition effect [12]. A \nhigher migration rate of methanol in oil was observed when \nTUK paper was used in comparison with standard Kraft paper. \nThis phenomenon is probably due to the presence of nitrogen \ncompounds in TUK papers that modify the partitioning of \nmethanol between two phases [13], whereby differences in \npaper composition, humidity, etc. can also modify the \nmigration behavior of methanol molecules from the paper to \nthe oil.   \nIn the very first part of the curves for methanol presented in \nFigure 2, a linear progression of methanol was assessed.  This \nrelationship agrees with the methanol generation model [13] \nthat showed a direct relationship between the number of \nscissions of glycosidic bonds in the cellulose chains and the \ngeneration of methanol over time. At a certain point, the \nmethanol production reached a plateau and stabilized. At that \npoint, the degradation of the paper has reached more stable \ncrystalline regions and the plateau in methanol behavior is \nexpected because of the availability of the bonds. This \nbehavior has been observed in previous studies [10], [13] \nand it could also be attributed to a modification of the \nmethanol paper/oil partitioning due to a build-up of oil \noxidative products in the liquid phase. However, this \nbehavior has only been observed when the paper insulation \n3628\nO. H. Arroyo et al.: Relationships between Methanol Marker and Mechanical Performance of Electrical Insulation Paper\n \nhas reached its end of life for an application in \ntransformers. \nBecause the LODP was reached, this figure gives a \ncomplete representation of how methanol is generated, due \nmainly to the aging mechanics of acid hydrolysis. \nThe concentration of methanol allows the different aging \nsteps to be tracked, from the initial rapid rate of degradation \nfollowed by the slow progression to a steady rate, in both \nstandard Kraft paper and thermally upgraded Kraft papers. For \nthe curve fitting of TUK of Figure 2b, three unusual and \nunknown high values of MeOH were not taken into account.  \nThe generation of ethanol during aging was also measured but \nis not being presented here. Concentrations between 150 and \n200 ppb were registered for both types of papers. These low \nvalues could be related to the absence of an abnormal aging \nevent, such as a hot spot, during the experiment’s duration \n[14]. The generation of ethanol was not affected by a higher \ngrammage of the TUK paper or the additional nitrogen present \nin this paper.  \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400DPv\nKraft\nTUK\n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nAging duration (h)\nMeOH/g ppb/(g/m 2)\n \nFigure 2.  a) Evolution of the degree of polymerization and b) Generation \nof methanol in standard Kraft and TUK papers. \nFigure 3 shows the correspondence between the degree of \npolymerization and the remaining percentage of the tensile \nindex in both types of paper. The correlation curve appears in \ntwo distinct sections. In the first section, the degree of \npolymerization decreases without a very significant change in \nmechanical strength or tensile index of the paper. This \nbehavior is in agreement with the initial accelerated loss of \nDP\nv over time for both types of paper. The faster initial \ndegradation is related to the amorphous regions of cellulose; \ni.e., due to their accessibility, they are easily degraded. The \nKraft paper has a high degree of crystallinity and morphology \n[15]. Therefore, the papers maintain their mechanical \nproperties at this level even if there is loss of DP\nv. The first \nsection of the curve implies that the mechanical performance is \nbased mainly on the strength of the crystalline regions of \ncellulose and the fiber-to-fiber bonds. In the second section of \nthe curve, a linear correlation was established between the DPv \nand the tensile index. The reduction in the degree of \npolymerization controlled the loss of the paper’s mechanical \nstrength; at this level of aging, most of the amorphous regions \nwere degraded and the crystalline regions endured the aging \nprocess better. However, the presence of more scissions in the \ncellulose chains at the molecular level also has an impact at a \nmacro level by decreasing the paper strength.  \n   For both papers, the correlation converged into one curve. \nEven with the difference in composition and grammage, the \ncorrelation at the molecular level between the two parameters, \nTidx and DPv, appears to be intrinsic. The final section of the \ncurve reached values slightly lower than the LODP, around \n160.  At this level of degradation the mechanical performance \nof paper lost more than 80% of the initial value.  Reaching \nLODP gives the full picture of the aging process; the \ndegradation in this case was mainly driven by acid hydrolysis. \nAt this point, the paper samples were very fragile and could \nnot carry any large load. The loss of sample mass was \nnegligible (the grammage of the dried and de-oiled papers \nwas measured before and after aging), which indicates that \nthe cellulose crystalline structures were present but had lost \ntheir ability to support an external load. However, even at this \nlow mechanical strength level, the paper is expected to \nmaintain its insulating strength [2] \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0200400600800100012001400 DPv\nTensile Index (%) \nKraft\nTUK\n \nFigure 3.  Correlation between tensile index and DP v for standard Kraft \nand TUK papers. \nFigure 4 shows the relationship between the average \nnumber of scissions (NS) in cellulose chains and the remaining \ntensile index in both types of paper. The NS was calculated as \nthe division of DPv,o by the value of DP v at different times \nminus one. \nThe progression in times of the NS and Tidx were opposite; \nwhen these two parameters are presented together, a linear \ncorrelation was found, as shown in a previous study [9]. This \nlinear correlation relates the number of scissions in the \ncellulose chain with the mechanical performance of paper. The \nnumber of scissions increased linearly over time (not shown \nhere) for both types of papers. In the case of the standard Kraft \npaper, the rate of degradation was higher than for the TUK \npaper. This difference was because the addition of extra \nnitrogen and higher grammage in TUK paper slowed down the \naging process. However, after a longer aging period, both \npapers reached a similar average number of scissions per \ncellulose chain. The average number of scissions in cellulose \nthat corresponds to a zone where the paper has lost its \nmechanical strength is NS ~ 5.5, where there is only 20% of \ninitial paper strength, independent of the type of paper. Again, \nthese two parameters with different levels of influence \n(molecular and macro level) show a direct relationship \nbetween them.  \na)  \nb)  \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 22, No. 6; December 2015\n3629\n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n010 20 30 40 50 60 70 8090100 Tensile index (%) \nNS (DPv,0/DPv,t)-1\nKraft\nTUK\n \nFigure 4. Relationship between number of scissions and tensile index of \nstandard Kraft and TUK papers. \nFigure 5 shows the correlation between the concentration of \nmethanol and the evolution of the number of scissions. These \ncorrelations show linear behavior in the first part of the curve \nbetween these two parameters. \nThe methanol levels were normalized to compensate for the \ndiffering grammage for both papers. In this case, two curves \nwere generated for each type of paper, even after the \nnormalization by grammage. This difference in values can be \nattributed to the partition effect, whereby different conditions \nof the aging process such as composition, initial water content, \ncell internal pressure or other factors influence the migration of \nthe methanol molecules from the cellulose to the oil.  \n For both papers (standard Kraft and TUK), an initial linear \nrelation between the number of scissions and the normalized \nmethanol is observed up to methanol values of ~ 50 \nppb/(g/m²) for standard Kraft paper and 60 ppb/(g/m²) for \nTUK paper. A plateau is subsequently reached where the \ndegradation of cellulose slows down and the concentration of \nmethanol does not increase. This initial linear relationship was \nobserved in a previous study [13].    \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n012345678\nNS (DPv,o/DPv,t)-1\nMeOH/gram ppb/(g/m 2) Kraft\nTUK\n \nFigure 5.

In both \ncases a linear relation was found as expected, based on the \nprevious linear correlation between the concentration of \nmethanol and NS and the correlation between the Tidx and \nNS. A previous attempt [9] to reach a distinct linear \nrelationship between methanol and tensile strength was \nunsuccessful due to a leak of the volatile compounds, \nincluding methanol, from the aging cells.  \nTwo quasi-parallel linear correlations were generated in this \nstudy for the standard Kraft and TUK paper; this difference \ncan be explained by the effect of the partition phenomenon or \nmigration of the methanol molecules from the paper to the \nfluid. However, the direct description of mechanical \nperformance (macro level property) with a chemical marker at \nthe molecular level is clear.  \n   This relationship also proves the strong and reliable potential \nof using methanol as a chemical marker of aging in standard \nKraft and TUK papers. This correlation should be further \nexplored in order to determine its potential as a tool for \nassessing the condition of the paper in power transformers still \nin service.  \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n10 20 304050 60 70 80 90 100Tensile index (%)\nMeOH/gram ppb/(g/m 2)\nKraft\nTUK\n \nFigure 6. Correlation between the methanol concentrations normalized by \npaper grammage and the remaining te nsile index of standard Kraft and \nTUK papers. \nThe evolution of the acidity and water in the fluid during \nthe aging process was also analyzed. The values of acidity \nfor both types of papers were evaluated as very low due in \npart to the fluid’s high stability to oxidation. Indeed, the \ncolor and appearance of the Luminol is clear even after \n1000 hours of aging at 170 °C.  The effect of the low \nacidity in the paper can also explain the longer time needed \nto reach a complete degradation (DP\nv of 200) of the \nsamples in comparison with other studies in which the \nsamples were impregnated with mineral oil. In addition, in \nthis study the cells were filled to full capacity, compared to \na binary atmosphere (gas/liquid) formed when mineral oil \nwas used in [13]. The water content in the fluid was around \n10 ppm for both types of paper. However, the water content \nwas probably higher during the aging and decreased after \ncooling down migrating towards the paper. At these \nconditions, the mechanics of acid hydrolysis could also \nhave been slowed down.  \nThe 2-FAL analysis was also performed; however, 2-\nFAL could not be detected. This might be due to the fact \nthat at this high temperature, the 2-FAL had further \nchanged into another molecule, such as furan, which was \nobserved for both types of papers. This hypothesis should \nbe further studied. \n4     CONCLUSIONS \nThree linear relationships were established in this study. \nThe direct correlation between the generation of methanol \nand the number of scissions proved that methanol is a \nrobust indirect method for describing the condition of \ninsulating paper. The second linear correlation showed that \nthe number of scissions in cellulose chains has a direct \n3630\nO. H. Arroyo et al.: Relationships between Methanol Marker and Mechanical Performance of Electrical Insulation Paper\n \nimpact on the mechanical perf ormance of the paper. This \ncorrelation also shows a parameter measured at the \nmolecular/micro level that can  be used for assessing a \nproperty at a macro level. Finally, the correlation found \nbetween the methanol content in the fluid and the tensile \nindex opens the door to a methodology for assessing the \nreal condition of the paper in power transformers still in \nservice. These findings should be complemented with post-\nmortem studies to validate the methodology. However, even \nduring the accelerated aging of paper samples performed under \nlaboratory conditions, the partition phenomenon plays an \nimportant role in the concentration of methanol in oil. This \nphenomenon explains how changes in parameters such as \ntemperature, internal pressure, humidity, type of paper and oil, \netc. can change the migration of the generated methanol from \nthe scissions of cellulose chains to the oil. \nMore experimental accelerated aging that varies different \nparameters such as temperature, humidity and type of oil are \nneeded to understand the impact of these changes in the \nevolution of the concentration of methanol as well as the \nphenomenon of partition.  \nThe results support the main goal of this study, which is to \nuse methanol as a tool for assessing the real condition of paper \nand its mechanical performance as solid insulation over time. \nUltimately, it can help predict the lifespan of power \ntransformers.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n    The authors would lik e to thank Hydro-Québec and \nMITACS for supporting this pr oject.
