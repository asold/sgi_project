  "abstract": "This chapter introduces the Governance Assessment Tool that has been used in the DROP project and forms the analytical basis of this book. We start with the origins of the tool in Contextual Interaction Theory, and proceed with the dimensions and criteria that form the backbone of the tool, and form a matrix. In these matrix evaluative questions are formulated that can be discussed with local and regional stakeholders. Based on their answers and further information and insights a judgment can be reached to what extent the governance circumstances are supportive, restrictive or neutral for the implementation of measures. A visualization with coloured cells of the matrix can show in one quick glance the governance state of affairs in that region. To create more precise visualization arrows can be added to each box indicating upward or downward trends for that box. The chapter ends with a discussion on the application of the GAT. The tool can both be used in relatively simple ways and as in the DROP-project in a very elaborate way.",

Mentioning all three issues does not\nimply that they have clear boundaries between them. Instead, between vision and\npolicies and between policies and their implementation mutual in ﬂuences occur.\nOften policies get further shape in the process of implementing them. This is more\ntrue when the policy formation and implementation have a multi-actor character,\nlike in most cases of drought resilience management in Northwest Europe. Instead\nof singular policies with a separate implementation process, drought management is\noften a combination of water system and behavioural adaptations, which relates to\nand draws resources from various policy sectors, and requires concerted action on\nmultiple levels and time scales (Bressers and Lulofs 2010). Such a challenge can be\nlabelled as complex and dynamic. It requires a lot of ‘connective capacity ’\n(Edelenbos et al. 2013). It is essentially this nature of ‘complex and dynamic\nmulti-actor interaction processes ’that requires a good governance context to enable\nthe realisation of practice projects. Without a good governance context the degree\nof trust, openness and mutual liking is likely too low to allow for real cooperation.\nIn Chap. 1 it has been explained that the analyses in this book make use of a\nspeciﬁc theory and method of governance analysis that aims to be practice oriented in\nH.

In this chapter, this so-called\nGovernance Assessment Tool will be presented and explained. Also some remarks\nguiding its use will be made. In the next section we will ﬁrst introduce the theoretical\napproach in which the Governance Assessment Tool is rooted (Sect. 3.2). In this\nso-called Contextual Interaction Theory, operational decision making and imple-\nmentation processes are studied from three actor characteristics (motivations, cog-\nnitions and resources) that are in ﬂuenced by the three contextual layers of case\nspeciﬁc circumstances, the governance context and the more general wider context\nlike the technological development. Section 3.3 presents the Governance Assessment\nTool itself, including its descriptive and evaluative questions. Thereafter in Sect. 3.4\nwe will guide the reader on how to use it to facilitate governance analysis.\n3.2 Understanding Policy Implementation as Multi-actor\nInteraction Process: Contextual Interaction Theory\nThe Governance Assessment Tool is rooted in a theory of policy implementation\nthat is labelled Contextual Interaction Theory (Bressers 2004, 2009; De Boer and\nBressers 2011). It views implementation processes not top down, as just the\napplication of policy decisions, but as multi-actor interaction processes that are\nultimately driven by the actors involved. Thus it makes sense to explain the course\nand results of the process from that simple starting point and to place these actors\nand their main characteristics central stage in any analytical model. This is also\nrelevant because in the history of implementation research hundreds of crucial\nsuccess factors were proposed and used to analyse all kinds of different cases. This\ncan be theoretically interesting when one can try to carve out the impact of a single\nfactor from those of all the others. In practical reality however practitioners must\ndeal with situations in which all factors are around simultaneously, and thus with\ncombinations of all factors that are thought to matter (Bressers and O ’Toole 2005).\nEven in a rather simple model of ﬁfteen factors having each only two possible\nvalues there are some thirty thousand different combinations of circumstances that\ncan be imagined. That is not only unworkable as an analytical tool (Goggin 1986),\nit is also overdone. There are no thirty thousand (or more) fundamentally different\nimplementation settings. But since interaction processes are human activities, all\ninﬂuences ﬂow via the key characteristics of the actors involved (Bressers and Klok\n1988). Thus, it is possible to explain the course and effects of implementation\nprocesses with a set of three core factors per actor. Such explanatory model is far\nmore parsimonious, at least to begin with. All other factors, including governance\nconditions, are regarded as belonging to the context that may in ﬂuence this set of\ncore factors. In Fig. 3.1 we include these factors: their motivations that may spur the\nactors into action, their cognitions, information held to be true, and their resources,\nproviding them with capacity to act individually and power in relation to other\nactors. Among the actors involved in the process there need to be a suf ﬁciently\n46 H. Bressers et al.\nstrong combination of motivations, cognitions and resources to enable the process\nto succeed (Bressers 2004; Owens 2008).\nThe basic assumptions of Contextual Interaction Theory are quite simple and\nstraightforward.\nThe theory ’s main assumptions are:\n1. Policy processes are multi-actor interaction processes. Both individuals, often\nrepresenting organisations or groups, or organisations themselves can be con-\nsidered actors when participating in the process.\n2. Many factors may have an in ﬂuence but only because and in as far as they\nchange relevant characteristics of the involved actors.\n3. These characteristics are: their motivation, their cognitions and their resources,\nproviding them with capacity and power (Knoepfel et al. 2011: 68).\n4. These three characteristics are in ﬂuencing each other, but cannot be limited to\ntwo or one without losing much insight (Mohlakoana 2014).\n5. The characteristics of the actors shape the process, but are in turn also in ﬂuenced\nby the course and experiences in the process and can therefore change during the\nprocess. There is a dynamic interaction between the key actor characteristics that\ndrive social interaction processes and in turn are reshaped by the process.\nDeliberate strategies of actors involved can try to promote such changes both in\nother actors and within their own group or organisation.\nAnd, as we will discuss further on in this section:\n6. The characteristics of the actors are also in ﬂuenced by conditions and changes in\nthe speci ﬁc case context of for instance characteristics of the geographical place\nand previous decisions that among others can set the stage for some actors and\nexclude others from the process.\n7. A next layer of context is the structural context of the governance regime. This\nis the context that our Governance Assessment Tool concentrates on.\n8. Around this context there is yet another more encompassing circle of political\nsystem, socio-cultural, economical, technological, and problem contexts. Their\ninﬂuence on the actor characteristics may be both direct and indirect through the\ngovernance regime.\nFig. 3.1 Process model with\nthe actor characteristics used\nin Contextual Interaction\nTheory ( Source Bressers\n2009)\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 47\nFigure 3.2 shows these various layers of context. They are pictured as over-\nlapping circles that all three have direct potential impact on the characteristics of the\nactors, indicating that wider context do not need to ﬁrst in ﬂuence governance and\nthen the speci ﬁc case context before having an impact, even though some of their\ninﬂuence will work like that. Also the other way around, the case process\ninﬂuencing the evolution of the contexts, is possible, but this in ﬂuence will mostly\nbe limited to the speci ﬁc context.\nIn Fig. 3.3, many theorems and other ideas are employed. Compared to Fig. 3.1\nthis ﬁgure does also show process development (change processes — in the form of\nthe processes over time). The actor characteristics are much more elaborated here,\nnot visualised as linked to speci ﬁc actors and for presentation reasons placed\noutside of the process box. This enables showing the mutual in ﬂuences between\nthese factors and the process itself (compare Mohlakoana 2014).\nMotivations— The origins of motivations for behaviour, including for the posi-\ntions taken in interaction processes, ﬁrst of all lay in own goals and values.\nSelf-interest, like in many economic theories, plays of course a strong role here. But\nalso more altruistic values can directly lead to genuine own goals (Gatersleben and\nVlek 1998). External pressures can be also a motivating force. Like all motivational\nfactors they could in principle also be conceptualised as belonging to one ’s ‘own’\npurposes. However, such conceptualisation will make them often forgotten or\nunderemphasised. These external pressures can be based on force, but more often\nwill be softer in ﬂuences from normative acceptance of the legitimacy of such\nexternal wishes and even by identi ﬁcation with the group from which such\nexpectations come. Last but not always least also the ‘self-effectiveness assessment’\n(Bandura 1986) can play a large role as a motivational factor. This concept points to\nthe de-motivational effect that occurs when an actor perceives its preferred beha-\nviour as beyond its capacity. It shows part of the relation between motivation and\nthe availability of resources. While all of these elements are rooted in social and\nFig. 3.2 Interaction processes in ﬂuenced simultaneously by various layers of context\n48 H. Bressers et al.\nlearning psychology and thus seem to apply to individuals, also organisations and\nindividuals representing groups and organisations (so-called ‘corporate actors ’) can\nhave the same set of origins of motivations.\nCognitions— The cognitions of actors (interpretations of reality held to be true)\nare not only a matter of observations and information processing capacity, though\nthese aspects are important and with the information technology revolution are a\nsource of quick changes. In policy sciences the so-called ‘argumentative turn ’\n(Fischer 1995; Fischer and Gottweis 2012), re ﬂects a variety of approaches that\nemphasise that knowledge is produced itself in mutual interactions, based on\ninterpretations of reality of actors, that themselves are mediated by frames of ref-\nerence. Some frames of reference are termed by Axelrod ( 1976)a s ‘cognitive\nmaps’, by Sch ön( 1983), Sch ön and Rein ( 1994) and later van Hulst and Yanow\n(2014)a s ‘frames’, by Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith ( 1999)a s ‘policy core beliefs ’\nand ‘deep core beliefs ’. Dryzek ( 1997) speaks of ‘discourses’, thereby also stressing\nthe language dependency of understanding and the role of words, one-liners, stories\nand the like to guide, but also to restrict and bias understanding. While these\napproaches are quite different in their conceptual understanding and methodology\nof reconstruction, they also share some understandings: that cognitions are not just\nfactual information about, but more interpretations of reality, and that such inter-\npretations are in ﬂuenced by ﬁlters, frames and interactions with other actors. Not\nFig. 3.3 Dynamic interaction between the key actor characteristics that drive social interaction\nprocesses and in turn are reshaped by the process ( Source Bressers 2009)\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 49\nthe whole of the theoretical approaches mentioned, but only this ‘common ground ’\nis incorporated in the cognitions box of the contextual interaction theory. Part of\nthese frames is related to ‘boundary judgments ’, ideas about what does and what\ndoes not belong to a subject at hand (Bressers and Lulofs 2010). These different\ncognitions can refer to subjects or aspects of the project or the problems it wants to\nsolve, or about the time frames that are relevant like short term results versus\ncontributing to a long term vision, or about the relevant levels and scales: just local,\nor also embedded in a higher level or bigger scale of problem-solving. Differences\nin these boundary judgments between the various actors in the process can have\nsigniﬁcant impacts on their interactions in the process.\nResources— While resources as an actor characteristic are important to provide\ncapacity to act, in the relational setting of an interaction process they are also\nrelevant as a source of power. Resources are here meant to be any asset that public\nand private actors can use to support their actions. This implies that the relevance of\nresources is dependent on the actions an actor wants to perform. Having resources\nthat other actors need access to for their preferred actions provides a basis of power.\nWhile in the previous ﬁgures the actor characteristics are purely linked to separate\nactors in Fig. 3.3 they are related to the actions and interactions in the process.\nTherefore this box is labelled “capacity and power ” in Fig. 3.3. The relationship\nbetween power and resources is not always direct. Power in ﬁrst instance largely\nresults of attribution to an actor by others. However when this attribution is not\nbacked by real resources it is fragile as soon as it is challenged. The resources that\nare the root of these powers encompass much more than formal rules, though legal\nrights and other institutional rules can be an important part of it, aside from\nresources such as money, skilled people, time and consensus (Klok 1995; Knoepfel\net al. 2011).\nNot only the resources of the actors themselves, but moreover the dependency of\nan actor on the resources of another actor shapes the balance of power. A classic\nexample is the dependency of authorities on the jobs created by industry, which\nindustry can use as a source of negotiation power. The example also shows that in\nContextual Interaction Theory not just formal powers count, but that power can be\nbased on all kinds of resources. Resources not only shape power relations, but are\nalso a prerequisite for action as such, determining the capacity to act of any actor.\nThe resource base for action can be greatly enlarged by engaging in dependencies\nwith other actors with relevant resources, at the expense of loss of autonomy and\nthus— in some cases — power. Whether a speci ﬁc resource contributes to capacity\nand power depends on the action that is intended. Resources that seem irrelevant to\nget certain things done might be essential to get other things done.\nThere are mutual relations between the three key actor characteristics. Every\nchange in one of the three has in ﬂuences on the other two. While we typically start\nwith mentioning motivation, many would like to start with the way reality is\nunderstood and problems and chances perceived, or whether some useful infor-\nmation is available (on relevant technology, economics, social, geographical or\nenvironmental conditions), as a prerequisite for motivation. It must be borne in\nmind that the in ﬂuence is mutual: without certain interests and values, available\n50 H. Bressers et al.\ndata may be overwhelming and too time consuming to process. The development of\ninformation needs some focusing of attention (creating selective perception as a\nbias). The actions for which an actor is motivated require resources, and the\navailability of those resources is bound to in ﬂuence the actors ’ ambition, for\ninstance because a lack of necessary resources creates a low self-effectiveness\nassessment (Bandura 1986). While ‘knowledge is power ’ (attributed to Francis\nBacon 1561 –1626) may be one-sided, it is certainly true that information can serve\nstrategic purposes and hence can be used as one of the bases of power. On the other\nhand the gathering and processing of data is also an activity that needs resources.\nLastly, the three factors are not only shaping, but are also (re)shaped by the\nactivities and interactions that happen in the process.\nAbove we explained the model of social interaction processes in Contextual\nInteraction Theory. It is applied to the implementation of drought resilience mea-\nsures in this book. It has been used extensively in implementation case studies on\nvarious ﬁelds, also outside of the water sector. Its treatment in this section served to\nshow what our understanding is of the nature of the processes that may ﬁnd more or\nless supportive governance and other contexts in practice. Contextual Interaction\nTheory contains not only this part on the interaction process of implementation and\nrealisation but also a part on these contexts and their relevance. In the next section\nwe will explain the layers of context further and how they may be supportive or\nrestrictive for the success of the interaction processes under study. In doing this we\nwill concentrate on the layer of governance characteristics.\nGovernance is often said to differ from earlier developed concepts like gov-\nernment or policy in that it emphasises the multi-level and multi-actor character of\nall forms of steering of any speci ﬁed (sub)sector of society. In our approach to the\nconcept of governance we do not only discern the multiplicity of the levels and of\nthe actors involved, but also apply the idea that the concept of governance assumes\nmultiplicity to the dimensions of the older concept of policy: goals, instruments and\nthe means to apply them (Howlett 2011). In each governance context there will\nlikely be multiple goals involved, multiple instruments and multiple means to apply\nthem. In Chap. 1 it was explained how this led to a conceptualization of governance\nin ﬁve dimensions (Bressers and Kuks 2003).\nIn Fig. 3.4 these dimensions are listed as ﬁlling the structural layer of context for\nthe implementation processes. The structural context at for instance national level is\nmuch more stable than the speci ﬁc case context. The structural context will to a far\nlesser degree be in ﬂuenced back by individual implementation cases. In fact it is the\nessence of the difference between the speci ﬁc and the structural context that the\nlatter holds for in principle all similar cases and not only for any speci ﬁc case. This\nis not to say that the structural context is not changing over time, just that these\nchanges are even more the emergent result of many actors and factors than changes\nin the speci ﬁc context.\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 51\n3.3 The Governance Assessment Tool\nThe previous section has explained some theoretical roots of the type of governance\nassessment that we use in this book. In this section we will explain the Governance\nAssessment Tool that has been further developed in the context of the DROP\nproject. To be able to systematically describe what the ﬁve dimensions of gover-\nnance look like in the given governance context we developed a set of questions\nthat can be used to guide the analysis of policy and other archival documents, and\nstructure the conduct and analysis of qualitative interviews with key informants.\nFigure 3.5 gives an overview. All ﬁve dimensions include a descriptive question\nregarding the time dimension — that is, ‘Have any of these changed over time or are\nlikely to change in the foreseeable future ’. In the context of the DROP project, it\nwas particularly relevant to include this time dimension to spot any visible trends in\nthe governance dimensions across case study regions. This is particularly important\nin Europe where countries face the same deadlines, like the 2015 –2021–2027\nassessment years of the Water Framework Directive.\nWhile it is not dif ﬁcult to see that all ﬁve elements of governance have strong\nrelevance for the inputs into the process and the motivations, cognitions and\nresources of the actors therein, they do not specify what aspects of them create a\nmore or a less stimulating context for the process.\nFig. 3.4 Elaboration of the layers of context in contextual interaction theory ( Source Bressers\n2009)\n52 H. Bressers et al.\nTo indicate what status of the ﬁve elements of governance contributes to a\nstimulating rather than restrictive governance context for the implementation and\nrealisation of water management measures, four quality criteria have been elabo-\nrated over the years (Bressers and Kuks 2004; De Boer and Bressers 2011; Kuks\nFig. 3.5 Main descriptive questions specifying the ﬁve elements of governance for water\nmanagement implementation ( Source Bressers et al. 2013)\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 53\net al. 2012; Bressers et al. 2013, 2015). The structural context in ﬂuences the process\nnot only through its direct contents, but also through its extent and coherence\n(Knoepfel et al. 2001, 2003; Bressers and Kuks 2004). The extent refers to the\ncompleteness of the regime. The coherence is the degree to which the various\nelements of the regime are strengthening rather than weakening each other.\nRegimes with an insuf ﬁcient extent are by de ﬁnition weak as guardians of\nsustainable use of water resources, while some relevant parts of the domain go\nunregulated. Most of the time, growing complexity is an answer to real needs and\ndevelopments. As a matter of fact, societies in modern times have generally grown\ninto a situation of increased complexity. Increased populations, borders, overlaps,\nactivities, rivalries, etc. are a fact of our current living environments. A growing\ncomplexity in governance can be viewed as a logical adaptation to that development\n(Gerrits 2008; Teisman et al. 2009). Many external change agents, such as tech-\nnological developments, add new scales, new actors, new problem perceptions, new\ninstruments, and new responsibilities to the existing ones. The essence of extent is\nnot the number of involved scales, actors, perceptions, instruments and resources as\nsuch, but rather the degree to which these are complete in re ﬂecting what is relevant\nfor the policy or project. In that sense it should not be mistaken for another way of\nmaking a descriptive inventory like with the descriptive questions.\nBy coherence we mean the following: When more than one layer of government\nis dealing with the same natural resource (as is often the case), then coherence\nmeans inter alia that the activities of these layers of government are recognised as\nmutually dependent and in ﬂuencing each other ’s’effects. Likewise if more than one\nscale is relevant the interaction effects between those scales should be considered.\nWhen more than one actor (stakeholder) is involved in the policy, coherence means\nthat there is a substantial degree of interaction in the policy network, and preferably\nproductive interaction providing coordination capacity. When more than one use or\nuser is causing the problem of unsustainable resource use for example, coherence\nmeans that the various resulting objectives are analysed in one framework so that\ndeliberate choices can be made if and when goals and/or uses are con ﬂicting. When\nthe actors involved have problem perceptions that start from different angles,\ncoherence means that they are capable of integrating these to such an extent that a\ncommon ground for productive deliberation on ambitions is created. The same\nholds for instrumental strategies that are used to attain the different objectives, as\nwell as for the different instruments in a mix to attain one of these objectives.\nCoherence of the organisation of implementation means that responsibilities and\nresources of various persons or organisations that are to contribute to the applica-\ntion of the policy are co-ordinated, or these actors themselves are co-ordinated.\nIn the implementation process, the additional fragmentation that is typical for\ncomplex but non coherent regimes will tend to lead to more discord between the\nactors (goals), more uncertainty (cognitions), and more stalemates (power) and,\nthereby, can hamper implementation. In the implementation process, coherence of\nthe structural context (the regime) will tend to lead to less discord (due to more\n‘win-win’— solution creativity), less (subjective) uncertainty (due to more exchange\nof information and less distrust) and less stalemates (due to less possibilities for\n54 H. Bressers et al.\ntarget groups to play the implementers off against each other and more standard\noperation procedures for the solution of con ﬂict).\nWhile in stable and relatively simple situations extent and coherence might be\nsufﬁcient to evaluate the degree to which the governance context is supportive or\nrestrictive for the implementation of policies and projects, more complex and\ndynamic situations require extra criteria (De Boer and Bressers 2011). For the\nsuccess and failure of complex spatial projects and policy implementation in\ncomplex situations in general, some form of ‘adaptive implementation ’ is impor-\ntant, trying not only to see the reality as a ﬁeld of obstacles, but also as a terrain of\npotential— often unexpected — opportunities and being adaptive enough to use\nevery ‘window of opportunity ’ to bring the ultimate purpose closer to realisation.\nTherefore it is essential that the somewhat static factors of extent and coherence are\nsupplemented with the factor of ﬂexibility, indicating to what degree the relevant\nactors have formal and informal liberties and stimuli to act.\nFlexibility is de ﬁned here as “the degree to which the regime elements support\nand facilitate adaptive actions and strategies in as far as the integrated (et al.\nmulti-sectoral) ambitions are served by this adaptiveness ”. Consequently it is also\nthe degree to which hindrances for such adaptive behaviour are avoided. Like\nextent and coherence, the ﬂexibility of the regime as such could be understood in\nterms of the ﬁve elements of governance described above. A regime is more ﬂexible\nin as far as the relationships between the levels and scales involved are more based\non decentralisation of power, without upper levels withdrawing support. This is\nclosely related to empowering rather than controlling relations, and thus on trust.\nA similar feature describes ﬂexible regimes in terms of actor relations in the policy\nnetwork. Here too the combination of giving leeway to each actor group to optimise\nits contribution to the whole programme while still viewing the programme as a\njoint effort quali ﬁes as ﬂexibility. In terms of general problem perception and goal\nambitions ﬂexibility implies that these in their variety are not only integrated into a\nsort of common denominator (like with coherence), but also that these mixtures are\nallowed to be different in emphasis according to the opportunities of the context in\nthe various concrete situations. This implies some acceptance of uncertainty and\nopenness to emergent options, which again relates to trust. The instruments and\ntheir combinations in policy strategies or mixes are more ﬂexible in as far as means\nfrom different sources (like public policies and private property rights) may be used\nas well as indirect means (here relating to opening or improving options for the use\nof means that more directly serve the goals) are available and allowed to be used.\nLastly the ﬂexibility of the organisation responsible for the implementation — the\nresponsibilities and resources given by the policy programme(s) — can be measured\nby the discretion available to pool resources like funds and people with those of\nothers to serve integrated projects and to be held accountable on the basis of the\nbalanced virtues of the achievements (as in an integrated project), rather than on the\nbasis of separate performance criteria.\nGiven the dynamic and change oriented nature of some policies, like realising\nmore drought resilience in the water system, there is yet another regime quality that\ncan be in ﬂuential for the practical process. That is the obvious, but no less important\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 55\naspect of intensity . Intensity is “the degree to which the regime elements urge\nchanges in the status quo or in current developments ”. The ‘amount of change ’ is\nthereby measured in analogy with Newton ’s ‘law of inertia ’, so as the degree of\nenergy it takes to produce the change. In systems theory, induced changes will\ntypically meet negative feedback loops, weakening their impact, while in some\ncases positive feedback loops creating dynamics for permanent change are also\nconceivable (True et al. 1999; Bressers and Lulofs 2009). In policy studies ’ terms\nintensity is related to the size of the task to create new dynamics by creative\ncooperation, or con ﬂict. Consequently this urges change of conservative motiva-\ntions or overcoming them by power, changing cognitions including widening of\nboundary judgments regarding the issues at stake, and developing new availabilities\nand combinations of resources. In other words: with more intensity the urge to use\nclever adaptive strategies to deal with and change the setting of the process\nincreases. In terms of the ﬁve elements of governance intensity is greater in as far as\nalso upper levels are more deeply involved, actors that are also powerful in other\ndomains are more deeply involved in the relevant policy network for the issue at\nstake, the issue plays a larger role in the public debate leading to a greater openness\nto try to push developments away from a business-as-usual track (thus with more\nambitious goals), the instruments made available to be used include more inter-\nventionist ones, and the amount of resources made available for implementation is\nlarger.\nIn summary, the four criteria are de ﬁned by the questions that they pose:\n1. Extent: are all elements in the ﬁve dimensions that are relevant for the sector or\nproject that is focused on taken into account?\n2. Coherence: are the elements in the dimensions of governance reinforcing rather\nthan contradicting each other?\n3. Flexibility: are multiple roads to the goals, depending on opportunities and\nthreats as they arise, permitted and supported?\n4. Intensity: how strongly do the elements in the dimensions of governance urge\nchanges in the status quo or in current developments?\nFor each of the ﬁve dimensions of governance, the four criteria mentioned above\nare speci ﬁed with speci ﬁc questions (Fig. 3.6) which forms a matrix of assessment\nfor the governance of drought and water scarcity for a region. This matrix forms the\ncore of the Governance Assessment Tool (GAT). Together, these questions shed\nlight on the degree of supportiveness or restrictiveness of the governance context\ntowards the implementation of policies and projects. It is important to note that the\nGAT does not assess the functioning or success of an actor or a speci ﬁc adaptation\nplan. Rather, the GAT assesses the entire governance context, enabling re ﬂections\non the way that this context supports or restricts the implementation of policies and\nprojects.\nWhile this version is developed by the scientists of the “governance team ” in the\nDROP project its usability reaches far beyond drought management. In fact the tool\nis applicable to a wide range of implementation projects in water management and\neven beyond.\n56 H. Bressers et al.\n3.4 Using the Governance Assessment Tool\nIt is important to note that even with all the questions that specify the cells of the\nmatrix, hard “measurement” in the sense of a quanti ﬁcation is not possible. Some\ndegree of “informed judgment ” is inevitable when assessing the status of the four\ncriteria relevant to the various governance dimensions.\nFig. 3.6 The governance assessment tool matrix with its main evaluative questions ( Source\nBressers et al. 2013)\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 57\nThe GAT can be used by stakeholders themselves, or as a guidance for inter-\nactive workshops with stakeholders. In the DROP project we had the opportunity to\nuse the GAT in a very elaborated way. Thus it makes sense to ﬁrst explain some\noptions on how to use the GAT in a situation that time and involvement are limited.\nThereafter we will explain how we used the tool in the DROP project and what we\nrecognised to be the main success factors.\n3.4.1 Diagnosing with the Governance Assessment Tool\nin a Short Period and with a Limited Number\nof People\nThe structure of the Governance Assessment Tool and the guiding questions it\nposes in each cell, enables any individual stakeholder (e.g. a project leader, or\npolicy advisor, or policy makers) who understands the dimensions and criteria to\nassess the governance context s/he is working in. All it requires is a few hours to\nassess the situation for each cell, on the basis of knowledge held by heart.\nObviously such assessment is limited by the degree of correctness of such esti-\nmates. But that is no reason to be negative about it. Such an individual thought\nexperiment at least turns implicit knowledge and perceptions into explicit ones that\ncan later be shared with others in a systematic way. It also serves the purpose that\nthe individual stakeholder becomes more aware of the issues on which there is\nuncertainty or even lack of knowledge. Lastly, assuming that the perceptions of\nsuch ‘insider’ make some sense indeed (as often will be the case), it provides an\nassessment of one ’s own working circumstances that can be practical in ﬁnding\nways to improve them or otherwise deal with them.\nA next step in elaborated use of the tool is when a group of practitioners\ninteractively uses it for a systematic brainstorm on the governance context of their\ncommon policy or project. This could take for instance the form of a half day\nworkshop. Compared with the previous approach there are more people that can\ncontribute knowledge and that can counter one-sided bias in perceptions, creating a\ndegree of “inter-subjectivity”. The joint effort is also an important aspect in itself, as\nit provides a basis for sharing information and sharing perceptions, that can later be\nof utmost value for productive collaboration (HarmoniCOP 2005). The session can\nbe concluded by brainstorming on how to deal with the governance context about\nwhich by then a joint understanding has evolved. In as far as differences of opinion\noccur and persist, the session has probably pinpointed more precisely than before\nwhere the disagreement is all about.\nA variant of the above is the situation in which an experienced analyst, for\ninstance a scientist that worked with the tool more often, leads the session, turning it\ninto a guided workshop . An obvious advantage is that the governance expert has a\ngood understanding of the precise meaning of the concepts and the reasons why\nthey are included in a model explaining the degree to which the context is\n58 H. Bressers et al.\nsupportive or not. This can help the participants to concentrate on the substantive\nmatters while nevertheless all cells of the assessment tool get appropriate attention.\nThe governance expert can also help in the interpretation of the consequences of the\nassessment and will develop experience in how to deal with such situations, cre-\nating learning from one case to another. The disadvantage however can be that the\nparticipants are less actively involved and feel more like interviewees than like\ndiscussants. A good balance between too much and too little guidance is important\nfor a productive process that provides the participants with learning experience.\nA further way in which the tool can be applied is when not practical learning\nexperiences of practitioners, but scientiﬁc research is the main purpose. In such a\nproject all kind of sources are used to assess the cells and interviews with practi-\ntioners are just part of the data gathering. The Governance Assessment Tool will in\nsuch studies often be used as a way to “measure” the dependent or independent\nvariable in the study. For this purpose normal approaches to methodology apply.\nOne more way in which the tool can be applied is the elaborate way it is done in\nthe DROP project (multiple analysts from multiple institutions, disciplines and\ncountries, in multiple rounds and various ways of interaction with practitioners).\nThis is a very special situation that requires much resources, but provided both\nscientiﬁcally and practically a lot of new knowledge. About this ideal methodology\n(and its risks and pitfalls!) the next subsection will elaborate further.\n3.4.2 Diagnosing with the Governance Assessment Tool\nin the DROP Project\nIn this section both experiences with using the GAT in the DROP project will be\nshared and advices for potential users will be presented that are based on the lessons\nlearned while using the GAT. While the text contains a lot of advices on how to use\nthe GAT, it does not have the character of a manual. As regards to the imple-\nmentation of the GAT in the case of the DROP project, a number of important\nfactors can be highlighted explaining the relative success of the project. Many of\nthem relate to the challenge of using the tool to assess a variety of cases with\ndifferent main policies and projects in various national and regional conditions. This\nrequires both a good common understanding of the concepts in the GAT and a good\ncommon understanding of the empirical situation that can be supported by the items\nlisted below.\nContinuous iteration between science and practice — A way to ensure the valid\nand reliable assessment of the governance context of a particular region is through\nliaising with those embedded strongly in the governance context and water man-\nagement reality. In the DROP project, the governance assessment has been\ndeveloped by social scientists with the help of the practice partners (project partners\nfrom the region such as water authorities and county councils) and other govern-\nmental and non-governmental stakeholders. This has allowed both for continuous\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 59\niteration between science and practice, as well as for access to regional stakeholders\nfor interviews to ensure an even representation of relevant stakeholders. In order to\nenable a complete coverage of the perspectives and opinions of different stake-\nholders, the governance team visited each region twice and prepared a draft\nassessment report for each region, which was ﬁnalised after the second round of\nvisits. The practice partners and other stakeholders interviewed were encouraged to\n‘feedback’into the draft reports to ensure that the governance assessment re ﬂected\nthe reality of water management in that speci ﬁc regional context. Having exchanges\nwith practice partners on the governance assessment can also contribute substan-\ntially to the development of recommendations. It is relatively easy to propose that\nsome action should be undertaken to improve or circumvent weaknesses in the\ngovernance context. But the development of advices about how to implement such\nactions needs inputs from the practice partners.\nDiversity in backgrounds of the analysts diagnosing the governance context\nplayed a positive role. It helps avoiding scienti ﬁc disciplinary terminology. Simple\nand clear messages are easier to translate into concrete and feasible actions. In an\ninterdisciplinary project team, there is a constant need for mutual adjustment and\nsearching for a common language. Equally, that the governance team was com-\nposed of ‘outsiders’to the region meant that there was objective re ﬂection on what\nwere sometimes very local issues and to the institutional rules and habits involved.\nQuestioning what would otherwise be taken for granted by observers from the own\ncountry or region, can provide important eye-opening re ﬂections.\nVisit several regions — In DROP we found it quite useful to have the team\nmembers visit several regions. This observation of several governance settings\nallows for comparative analysis already during the data gathering phase, and as a\nresult that creates the possibility to sharpen questions along the way. Most members\nof the governance team visited two or three regions twice, one team member even\nvisited all regions.\nAwareness raising ‘intervention’— Doing such research in the region also forms\na type of awareness raising ‘intervention’. A number of the stakeholders inter-\nviewed had a fairly low awareness of the relevance of drought for their cases and\nthe role of climate change therein. Nevertheless, the fact that an international\ngovernance team was visiting their region, asking many questions on the subject\nand returning with feedback and further questions half a year later contributed to\npushing drought and water scarcity onto regional agendas. The modi ﬁcation\nside-effect of such ‘action research ’ can also inhibit local actors in participating\nfully in the assessment. The fact that the GAT is not meant to evaluate the work of\nthe practice partners, but the context under which they have to do their work should\nbe made clear and might help in this respect.\nPre-collect existing documentation — Given the diversity of nationalities and\ndiversity of professional backgrounds of the governance assessment team, it was\nfound to be useful to collect some existing documentation or prepare a short\ndocument to provide prior information on the context of climate change, water\nmanagement, and other relevant policies of each region. This levelled up the\ngovernance team members ’ understanding of the main features of each site before\n60 H. Bressers et al.\nthe interviews. It also allowed the interviews to focus on issues that were not\npublished or available elsewhere, thus using the short time of the interviews more\nefﬁciently.\nGovernance analysts translating themselves — When translation was needed\nbetween the English language questions of the governance team members and the\nrepresentatives of stakeholders that were not comfortable in that language, it proved\nto be good to have one of the governance team members to ful ﬁl the “translator”\nrole. This way the relation between interviewers and interviewees did not get\ndisrupted and the knowledge of the tool by the governance team member ensured\ngood interpretations and summaries of what was said by the stakeholders.\nFurthermore it proved to be particularly useful to be able to adapt the questions to\nthe case by using terms of local institutions.\nLocal institution contacting stakeholders — The inclusion of a local institution as\na cooperative partner for the interviews was very useful for contacting relevant\nstakeholders. The local partner possessed a well-established network and could\nmore easily convince stakeholders to participate in interviews. Additionally, the\nlocal partner was central in compiling and screening the most relevant stakeholders\nand actors, including less obvious groups, to interview for achieving the widest\nscope possible. The assessment team made sure that also potential critics were\ninvolved among the stakeholders interviewed. A problem occurs if a major stake-\nholder group cannot be reached, because then the point of view of this group cannot\nbe involved in the discussions. During the second visits, the governance team tried\nto make up for such situations, in some cases by visiting those stakeholders at their\nown of ﬁces or even homes. Like with all evaluations, selected outcomes of the\ngovernance analysis can also be used by actors as a tool in power relations. While\nthe use of the GAT requires mutual trust between the interviewed actors and the\ngovernance team, a neutral position is required, as well as a capability to understand\nand integrate various positions.\nThe interviews had a variety of settings — Some were individual interviews and\nsome group interviews to test the ef ﬁciency of each approach. The analysis is very\nmuch dependent on open discussions between the interviewees and the inter-\nviewers. It is necessary to gather critical issues, therefore individual interviews or\nsmall groups of interviewees seemed more suitable for the establishment of trust,\nand the open discussion of sometimes critical or dif ﬁcult issues. Another experience\nwas that the presence of a representative of the practice partner (water authority) at\nthe interviews was sometimes useful to get a good introduction of the governance\nassessment exercise to the interviewees, but should also be dealt with carefully in\norder to make sure that the interviewees feel they can talk freely.\nGenerally the GAT should not be used as a battery of questions to put forward\nduring each interview, but used as a checklist to make sure that all issues were dealt\nwith in the course of the conversation while keeping the ﬂow of the conversation as\nmuch as possible. The questions from the GAT should be adapted to the local\ncontours of each case, such that the questions targeted the speci ﬁc local context,\nincluding appropriate strategies and instruments, local actors, and level of analysis.\n3 The Governance Assessment Tool and Its Use 61\nDebrieﬁng sessions — Through a series of short debrie ﬁng sessions by the\ngovernance assessment team directly after each round of interviews, the data was\nextracted and analysed in the context of the 20 evaluation items of the GAT matrix.\nWithin a week after each session, a teleconference (phone or skype meeting)\nprovided additional exchange and inputs to the main authors of each case report.\nThe draft case reports were distributed for comments among the governance team\nmembers, and ultimately discussed with the practice partners during the second visit\nto the case areas. These draft reports also formed the basis for judging what issues\nto focus on in the second round of interviews — as the development of these reports\nallowed the identi ﬁcation of issues or stakeholder perspectives missing in the\nassessment.\nCareful summarising of results — The results of a GAT analysis can be sum-\nmarised, even in the form of ﬁgures or tables. The issue is that transferring the\nrichness of the data gathered by numerous documents and interviews into more\ncondensed layers of summary and ultimately into an overview has both positive and\nnegative aspects. On the one hand it is necessary to enable comparative analysis\nbetween several cases. On the other hand, the summary should not hide away\nessential observations that form the evidence for the scores. In the DROP project\nthis has been achieved by assessing each of the twenty cells of the matrix by a brief\nstatement and sometimes a score at a three or ﬁve point scale, followed by a\nparagraph to page length of observations on which this statement is based. The\nscores on a three point scale have also been translated into graphical visualisations\nshowing the matrix with colours ( ‘score cards ’) indicating the value of each cell.\nThese visualisations enable a quick overview of the results. However, one should\nalways keep in mind that such a summary of summary is a derivate of a much richer\nset of observations and its interpretation.\nComparative analysis — The multiple case study character of the use of the GAT\nhelped us to develop recommendations based on what works well elsewhere and\nwhat stands out in one region compared to other regions. Insights from pilot cases\nthat face similar challenges are potential sources of advices, with the bene ﬁto f\nhaving a clear example to illustrate the ideas with concrete outcomes. Additionally,\nas a contribution for the learning experience of the practice partners, hearing about\nthe governance assessment conclusions regarding other regions provides the pos-\nsibility to refresh the way their own context is reviewed.\nProcedure to compile recommendations — Statements of the different cells and\nquestions of the assessment matrix were screened carefully. Important connecting\nissues were then highlighted. Especially the critical statements, which the stake-\nholders made during the interviews, were screened by the governance team to\nidentify the improvement areas. This brainstorming exchange within the gover-\nnance team was useful in developing and structuring ideas relevant to the recom-\nmendations. Comparisons between the different case studies were also explored to\nidentify common issues as well as opportunities among the case studies. Different\napproaches and experiences could be compared and used as the basis for further\ndiscussion. One major step was to gather feedback to the developed recommen-\ndations. It was evident that the recommendations were developed with limited\n62 H. Bressers et al.\nknowledge of the history of the local and regional institutions and their culture and\nexperiences. As a result, it was very important to discuss the recommendations and\ngather feedback.\n3.5 Summary and Conclusion\nIn this chapter we have introduced the Governance Assessment Tool that has been\nused in the DROP project and forms the analytical basis of this book. We started\nwith the origins of the tool in Contextual Interaction Theory, and proceeded with\nthe dimensions and criteria that form the backbone of the tool, and form a matrix. In\nthese matrix evaluative questions are formulated that can be discussed with local\nand regional stakeholders. Based on their answers and further information and\ninsights a judgment can be reached to what extent the governance circumstances are\nsupportive, restrictive or neutral for drought adaptation. A visualisation with\ncoloured cells of the matrix can show in one quick glance the governance state of\naffairs in that region. To create more precise visualisation, arrows can be added to\neach box indicating upward or downward trends for that box. The chapter ends with\na discussion on the application of the GAT. The tool can both be used in relatively\nsimple ways and as in the DROP project in a very elaborate way.\nOpen Access This chapter is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons\nAttribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/), which\npermits any noncommercial use, duplication, adaptation, distribution, and reproduction in any\nmedium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, a\nlink is provided to the Creative Commons license, and any changes made are indicated.\nThe images or other third party material in this chapter are included in the work ’s Creative\nCommons license, unless indicated otherwise in the credit line; if such material is not included in\nthe work ’s Creative Commons license and the respective action is not permitted by statutory\nregulation, users will need to obtain permission from the license holder to duplicate, adapt, or\nreproduce the material.\nReferences\nAxelrod R (ed) (1976) Structure of decision.
