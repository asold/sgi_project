The similarity between\nSearch (S) and Recommendation (R) makes jointly modeling S&R a\npromising research topic. Some work [17, 18] propose to enhance\nrecommendation by learning from a unified sequence of search\nand recommendation behaviors. Others [1, 14] propose to improve\npersonalized search by adding users’ multi-interests in recommen-\ndation. Methods to model search and recommendation tasks jointly\nare also proposed in [21–24, 26]. JSR framework in [23] simultane-\nously learns retrieval and recommendation models with shared item\nset and optimizes a joint loss function. Researchers in [22] applied\ntwo-level transformer encoders, text encoder to learn documents\nand queries, session encoder to model the integrated sequence of\nsearch and browsing behaviors. [26] applied GNN to learn node em-\nbedding of user&item, and treat search query as a special attribute\nof edges in the graph. In industrial scenarios, there are several\nbenefits to model S and R jointly. First, there are multiple search\nand recommendation scenarios in a single mobile application. The\ntraining data collected in a single domain can’t fully reflect users’\ncomplete intents and is sub-optimal compared to modeling them\njointly. Secondly, majority of items are shared between search and\nrecommendation. Once users have impressions of any products,\nvideos, and services in a recommendation scenario, they should\nbe able to retrieve the item in Search later for repurchase or reuse\npurposes. Despite the similarity between Search and Recommen-\ndation, there are also difficulties in modeling them jointly, such\nas the data imbalance issue of multiple domains, the heteroge-\nneous issue of different item sets (videos, products, and services),\nthe negative transferring issue. With the latest developments in\nlarge language models (LLM) [2, 4, 5, 20, 27], the pretrain-finetune\nframework [7, 13, 18, 22, 26] greatly improves the performance of\narXiv:2309.08939v1  [cs.IR]  16 Sep 2023\nCIKM ’23, October 21–25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom Yuqi Gong et al.\ndownstream tasks. We are inspired by the strong expressive power\nof natural language features and propose to build the Search and\nRecommendation Foundation model on top of LLMs, which ex-\ntract low-level domain-invariant text features of the query (Q) and\nitem (I). The major difference between our S&R foundation model\nand traditional multi-domain multi-task models is how we use the\ndomain-invariant text features to help constrain the divergence of\ndifferent tasks, which alleviates data imbalance, negative transfer-\nring, and item heterogeneous issues. To summarize, our proposed\nS&R Foundation model has the following key contributions:\n•We apply LLMs in S&R Multi-Domain Foundation model,\nand extract domain invariant text features to help mitigate\nthe negative transferring and item heterogeneous issues in\nthe multi-domain settings.\n•We novelly proposed the Aspect Gating Fusion (Domain-\nSpecific Gating) to fuse the ID feature, text features from\nLLMs, and sparse features. The Domain Adaptive Multi-Task\nmodule is also used to extract the domain-specific query and\nitem towers’ representations.\n•For the cold start of new scenarios, we have conducted ex-\ntensive experiments both offline and online, to show the\neffectiveness of supervised fine-tuning of our S&R Founda-\ntion model in downstream tasks, which is now fully deployed\nonline and serving in Alipay’s mobile application.\n2 PROPOSED MODEL\n2.1 Problem Formulation\nGiven a set of 𝐾 search and recommendation tasks {𝐷𝑘}𝐾\n𝑘=1, 𝐷𝑘\ndenotes the dataset for the 𝑘-th task. We let U= {𝑢1,𝑢2,...,𝑢 𝑁}\ndenote the user set, I= {𝑖1,𝑖2,...,𝑖 𝑀}denote the item set and\nQ= {𝑞1,𝑞2,...,𝑞 𝑇}denote the search query set. In real-world sce-\nnarios, items in search and recommendation usually come from\ndifferent domains and are heterogeneous. Some items are shared\nacross multiple domains and some items belong to each specific\ndomain. And we let I= I1 ∪I2 ∪... ∪I𝐾 denote the union of all\nitems in 𝐾 domains, which contains 𝑀 items in total. We aim to\njointly train a search and recommendation (S&R) foundation model\n𝑀𝑆&𝑅\n𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 in the multi-task setting and predict the probability of\nuser 𝑢𝑙 click the item 𝑖𝑙 given input query 𝑞𝑙 as 𝑝(𝑦𝑐𝑡𝑟\n𝑙 = 1|𝑢𝑙,𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙).\nAnd for search scenarios, additional query-item relevance score is\nalso predicted as 𝑝(𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑚\n𝑙 = 1|𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙). For cold start of a new search or\nrecommendation scenario 𝐷∗, we restore parameters of embedding\ntables and partial network structures from the pretrained S&R foun-\ndation model 𝑀𝑆&𝑅\n𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 , and then apply supervised fine-tuning\non the downstream tasks, such as click through rate (CTR) predic-\ntion, query-item relevance prediction, etc. For the search task 𝐷𝑆\n𝑘,\nwe let𝐷𝑆\n𝑘 = {𝑥𝑙 = (𝑢𝑙,𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙),𝑦𝑙}𝑙, which denotes the search ranking\ntask given the triple input of (user, query, item) as(𝑢𝑙,𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙). For the\nrecommendation task 𝐷𝑅\n𝑘, we set search query set Q as emptyset ∅\nin 𝐷𝑅\n𝑘 = {𝑥𝑙 = (𝑢𝑙,𝑞𝑙 = ∅,𝑖𝑙),𝑦𝑙}𝑙.\n2.2 S&R Multi-Domain Foundation Model\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the S&R Multi-Domain Foundation model\nhas three main components: the User-Query-Item encoding mod-\nule, the Aspect Gating Fusion module, and the Domain-Adaptive\nMulti-Task module. Firstly, raw features of user, query and item\npass through the embedding layers, and we extract the ID embed-\nding, token-level text embedding and sparse features’ embedding.\nWe apply LLM to extract domain-invariant text features of query\nand item towers, which minimize the divergence of features’ distri-\nbution cross multiple domains. Secondly, the Aspect Gating Fusion\nmodule is designed to merge different groups of ID, text, sparse\nfeatures’ embedding. The fusion network is to balance the relative\nimportance of ID, text, and sparse features. Very few training sam-\nples contain ID features of cold start items and can’t represent them\nwell, and generic text features play more important role. Finally, we\nfeed the concatenated embedding of user, query and item towers to\nthe Domain Adaptive MTL module. The module has two outputs\nrepresenting the click through rate (CTR) prediction task and the\nquery-item relevance prediction task. The final loss function is the\nsum of CTR prediction loss L𝑐𝑡𝑟, relevance prediction loss L𝑠𝑖𝑚\nand domain adaptive regularization L𝑟𝑒𝑔.\n2.2.1 User Query and Item Encoding. We extract three towers for\nuser, query and item respectively. For the user tower, 𝑒𝐼𝐷𝑢 ∈R𝐷\ndenotes user id embedding. 𝑒𝑁𝐻\n𝑢 = [𝑥1,...,𝑥 𝑠,...,𝑥 𝑁𝐻]denotes\nthe unified sequence of both search and recommendation clicks\nin chronological order. Each behavior 𝑥𝑠 is encoded as multiple\nlayers of MLPs with inputs of ID feature, sparse feature of be-\nhavior type S or R, and other sparse features of attributes, 𝑥𝑠 =\n𝐹𝐶(𝑒𝐼𝐷𝑠 ⊕𝑒𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒\n𝑠 ⊕𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑠 ). For the query (𝑄) and item (𝐼) features,\nwe extract both domain-invariant text features, such as tokens in\nsearch query and items’ title, and the domain-specific sparse fea-\ntures. The tokens of 𝑄and 𝐼 go through the same tokenizer and we\nget the tokenized id sequences as integer tensors𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑞 and 𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛\n𝑖 .\n𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑞 = [𝑒1𝑞,𝑒2𝑞,...,𝑒 𝐿𝑞\n𝑞 ]∈ R𝐿𝑞×𝐷 denotes the query’s tokenized\nid tensor of length 𝐿𝑞, and 𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛\n𝑖 = [𝑒1\n𝑖,𝑒2\n𝑖,...,𝑒 𝐿𝑖\n𝑖 ]∈ R𝐿𝑖×𝐷 de-\nnotes the item’s tokenized id tensor of length 𝐿𝑖. For ID feature, we\nalso embed the search query as ID feature 𝑒𝐼𝐷𝑞 ∈R𝐷, and item ID\nas 𝑒𝐼𝐷\n𝑖 ∈R𝐷. For the sparse features, we embed sparse features of\n𝑄 as 𝑒𝑆𝑞 and sparse features of 𝐼 as 𝑒𝑆\n𝑖 . Finally, we get the feature\ngroups of query tower as 𝑒𝑞 = [𝑒𝐼𝐷𝑞 ,𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑞 ,𝑒𝑆𝑞]and the feature\ngroups of item tower as 𝑒𝑖 = [𝑒𝐼𝐷\n𝑖 ,𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛\n𝑖 ,𝑒𝑆\n𝑖 ].\nLLM as Domain-Invariant Feature Extractor\nWe apply the pretrained Large Language Model, such as BERT\n[6], GPT [2], ChatGLM [8, 25], to extract domain-invariant text fea-\ntures on both query tower and item tower, represented as𝜙𝑙𝑚(𝑄)=\n𝜙𝑙𝑚(𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑞 ) ∈R𝐿𝑞×𝐷 and 𝜙𝑙𝑚(𝐼)= 𝜙𝑙𝑚(𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛\n𝑖 ) ∈R𝐿𝑖×𝐷. Af-\nter mean pooling of the encoding layer, followed by shared lin-\near projection, we get the domain-invariant text representation\nof query and item as 𝐸𝑙𝑚(𝑄) = 𝑊𝑙𝑚 ×MEAN(𝜙𝑙𝑚(𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑞 )) ∈\n𝑅𝐻,𝐸𝑙𝑚(𝐼)= 𝑊𝑙𝑚 ×MEAN(𝜙𝑙𝑚(𝑒𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛\n𝑖 )) ∈𝑅𝐻. 𝑊𝑙𝑚 ∈R𝐻×𝐷\ndenotes the linear projection layer shared between query tower\nand item tower, 𝐻 denotes the hidden size of the learned repre-\nsentations. The language models’ representation is useful for cold\nstart scenarios, especially when we have few training samples to\nupdate the ID feature of new item 𝑖∗and new search query 𝑞∗.\nWe also apply linear projections 𝑊𝑞\n𝐼𝐷,𝑊𝑖\n𝐼𝐷 ∈ R𝐻×𝐷 to ID fea-\nture of query and item tower, and get the ID representation of\nquery and item as 𝐸𝐼𝐷(𝑄),𝐸𝐼𝐷(𝐼)∈ R𝐻. For the sparse features we\nhave separate network (usually multiple layers of MLPs) to encode\nAn Unified Search and Recommendation Foundation Model for Cold-Start Scenario CIKM ’23, October 21–25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom\nUser\nEmb Table\nTransformer\nUser Encoder\nID\nQuery Encoder\nQuery\nEmb Table\nItem Encoder\nLLM Sparse\nFusion\nID\nItem\nEmb Table\nLLM Sparse\nFusion\nEmb\nOutput A Output B\nDomain\nEmbedding\nDomain\nDivergence\nAspect Gating\nFusion\nDomain K\nDomain 2\nDomain 1\nExpert 1 Expert 2 Expert n\nID Sequence Sparse\nDomain Gating\n[CLS] Gating\nMean Gating\nDomain\nAdaptive MTL\nUser-Query-\nItem Encoding\nFigure 1: SR Multi-Domain Foundation Model Architecture\nquery and item as 𝐸𝑆(𝑄),𝐸𝑆(𝐼)∈ R𝐻. Finally, we get the feature\ngroups of query tower as [𝐸𝐼𝐷(𝑄),𝐸𝑙𝑚(𝑄),𝐸𝑆(𝑄)]and item tower\nas [𝐸𝐼𝐷(𝐼),𝐸𝑙𝑚(𝐼),𝐸𝑆(𝐼)].\n2.2.2 Aspect Gating Fusion. After low level networks 𝐿0 (embed-\nding tables) and 𝐿1 (feature encoding layers) in Figure 1, we fuse\ndifferent aspects of query and item as in literature [12]. Each aspect\n𝐸𝑎 represents some fine-grained properties of query and item, such\nas ID, text and sparse features. Adenotes the set of aspects we\nextract from query and item. In S&R scenarios, we set |A|= 3 as\nID, text and sparse attributes. Final representations are fused as\nweighted sum of different aspects’ representations.\n𝐸(𝑄)=\n∑︁\n𝑎\n𝑤𝑎(𝑄)𝐸𝑎(𝑄),𝐸(𝐼)=\n∑︁\n𝑎\n𝑤𝑎(𝐼)𝐸𝑎(𝐼) ∀𝑎 ∈|A|\nThe weight vector 𝑤(𝑄),𝑤(𝐼)∈ R|A| are outputs of a gating\nnetwork, and we have different strategies to design the network.\n•Mean-Gating StrategySimply mean pooling of different\naspects of query and item features as 𝑤𝑎 = 1\n|A|.\n•[CLS]-Gating StrategyWe use randomly initialized em-\nbedding 𝐸𝐶𝐿𝑆(𝑄),𝐸𝐶𝐿𝑆(𝐼)∈ R𝐻 to represent classification\ntoken [CLS] of query and item respectively.\n𝑤𝑎 = 𝑒𝐸𝐶𝐿𝑆𝐸𝑎\nÍ\n𝑎∈|A| 𝑒𝐸𝐶𝐿𝑆𝐸𝑎\n∈R|A|\n.\n•Domain-Gating Strategy\nWe design the domain gating strategy from the intuition\nthat the fusion network has different weights when merging\ndifferent aspects of query and item. To model the differ-\nences across domains, we randomly initialize the domain\nembedding 𝐸𝐷 = [𝐸𝐷1 ,𝐸𝐷2 ,...,𝐸 𝐷𝐾] ∈R𝐾×𝐻 as the rep-\nresentations of different domains. And the domain-specific\ngating is calculated as\n𝑤𝑎 = 𝑒𝐸𝐷𝑘𝐸𝑎\nÍ\n𝑎∈|A| 𝑒𝐸𝐷𝑘𝐸𝑎\n∈R|A|\n.\n2.2.3 Domain Adaptive Multi-Task Learning. The input to the Do-\nmain Adaptive Multi-Task module is the concatenation of represen-\ntations of user, query and item towers asx = 𝐸(𝑈)⊕𝐸(𝑄)⊕𝐸(𝐼). For\nmulti-domain setting, a series of multi-task and multi-domain mod-\nels are proposed, such as SharedBottom[ 3], MMoE[15], PLE[19],\nSTAR[16], SAMD[11], etc. These models use shared structures (Ex-\nperts or MLP layers) to model the similarity among different tasks or\ndomains, and use individual structures to learn the domain-specific\nproperties. The difficulty of training the multi-domain models is\nthe domain shift phenomena. For the k-th domain𝐷𝑘, the marginal\ndistribution of input feature 𝑝(x𝑘)and the conditional distribu-\ntion of predicting output 𝑦𝑘 as 𝑝(𝑦𝑘|x𝑘)has divergence from other\ndomains. The well studied MTL models handle the divergence of\nconditional distribution. We propose to add a Domain Adaptive\nLayer to the input features x𝑖, which maps the inputs from mul-\ntiple domains to a common vector space. We reuse the randomly\ninitialized domain embedding 𝐸𝐷 = [𝐸𝐷1 ,𝐸𝐷2 ,...,𝐸 𝐷𝐾]∈ R𝐾×𝐻\nin section 2.2.2 and concatenate the domain embedding 𝐸𝐷𝑘 to\nfeature vector x𝑖 of instances from the k-th domain 𝐷𝑘, followed\nby domain-specific linear transformation 𝑊𝑘. Suppose x𝑖 and x𝑗\ndenote two instances from different domains in the same training\nbatch, we can get the domain-adaptive representation ˆx𝑖,ˆx𝑗 as\nCIKM ’23, October 21–25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom Yuqi Gong et al.\nˆx𝑖 = 𝑊𝑖(x𝑖 ⊕𝐸𝐷𝑖),ˆx𝑗 = 𝑊𝑗(x𝑗 ⊕𝐸𝐷𝑗)\nWe apply domain adaptation [ 9] techniques to constrain the\ndivergence of distributions from domains 𝑖 and 𝑗 as 𝑝(ˆx𝑖)and\n𝑝(ˆx𝑗)as L𝑟𝑒𝑔 = Í\n𝑖,𝑗∈{1,2,...,𝐾}𝑑(𝑝(ˆx𝑖)||𝑝(ˆx𝑗)). In terms of diver-\ngence measurement, we compared different metrics such as Jensen-\nShannon Divergence (symmetric KL Divergence), Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (MMD) [10] in the experiment section. And we find\nthe Jensen-Shannon Divergence achieves the best performance as\nL𝑟𝑒𝑔 =\n∑︁\n𝑖,𝑗∈{1,2,...,𝐾}\nJS(𝑝(ˆx𝑖)||𝑝(ˆx𝑗))\n.\nFinally, on top of the Domain Adaptive Layer we stack the stan-\ndard Multi-Task module, such as MMoE to extract outputs and\npredict two objectives, CTR prediction 𝑦𝑐𝑡𝑟 and query-item rele-\nvance prediction 𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑚.\nCTR PredictionClick-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction is a com-\nmon task in both search and recommendation scenarios. We apply\na unified scoring function 𝑦𝑐𝑡𝑟\n𝑙 = 𝑓𝜃(𝑢𝑙,𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙)in the S&R founda-\ntion framework to predict CTR with the triple inputs of user, item\nand query as (𝑢,𝑞,𝑖 ). For search tasks, users have explicit search\nquery 𝑞. And for recommendation tasks users don’t have explicit\nintentions. So we set 𝑞= ∅as the default embedding in the unified\nscoring function.\nQuery-Item Relevance PredictionQuery-Item Relevance Pre-\ndiction is a common task in search scenarios, which predicts the\nrelevance score of query-item pair of (𝑞,𝑖)and train a function\n𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑚\n𝑙 = 𝑓𝜙(𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙)to represent query-item pair’s relevance score.\nThe relevance prediction is usually a classification task.\n2.2.4 Loss of S&R Foundation model. We train the S&R foundation\nmodel in multi-domain multi-task settings, using datasets from 𝐾\ndomains. Each domain calculates either or both of two objectives\nof CTR prediction 𝑦𝑐𝑡𝑟\n𝑙 = 𝑓𝜃(𝑢𝑙,𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙)and relevance prediction\n𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑚\n𝑙 = 𝑓𝜙(𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙), depending on whether the task is search or rec-\nommendation. The final objective function consists of three parts,\nthe loss for CTR prediction L𝑐𝑡𝑟, the loss for relevance prediction\nL𝑠𝑖𝑚, and the loss for domain adaptive regularizer L𝑟𝑒𝑔.\nL= L𝑐𝑡𝑟 +L𝑠𝑖𝑚 +L𝑟𝑒𝑔\nL𝑐𝑡𝑟 =\n∑︁\n𝑘∈𝐾\n∑︁\n𝑙∈𝑁𝑐𝑡𝑟\n𝑘\nL𝑐𝑒(𝑓𝜃(𝑢𝑙,𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙);𝑦𝑐𝑡𝑟\n𝑙 )\nL𝑠𝑖𝑚 =\n∑︁\n𝑘∈𝐾\n∑︁\n𝑙∈𝑁𝑠𝑖𝑚\n𝑘\nL𝑐𝑒(𝑓𝜙(𝑞𝑙,𝑖𝑙);𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑚\n𝑙 )\n2.3 Supervised Fine-Tuning Downstream Tasks\nThe pretrained S&R foundation model can benefit downstream\ntasks in the pretrain-finetune manner. The downstream model re-\nstores parameters from the foundation model, freezes part of the\nparameters and finetunes the remaining layers. We experiment dif-\nferent ways of freeze-finetune split. Firstly, the freeze-finetune split\nis between level 𝐿0 and 𝐿1 as in Figure 1. The pretrained embedding\nin level 𝐿0 is freezed and the remaining layers from 𝐿1 to 𝐿𝑛 are\nfinetuned. Secondly, the freeze-finetune split is between level 𝐿1\nand 𝐿2. The embedding in level 𝐿0 as well as the parameters of\nencoding layers in level 𝐿1 are freezed, and the parameters from\nlevel 𝐿2 to 𝐿𝑛 are finetuned. Given dataset of new downstream task\n𝐷∗ = {(𝑢∗\n𝑙,𝑞∗\n𝑙,𝑖∗\n𝑙),𝑦∗\n𝑙 }, the domain embedding 𝐸𝐷∗ ∈R𝐻 is ran-\ndomly initialized and finetuned. In the experiment section, we thor-\noughly tested the performance of different ways of freeze-finetune\nsplit. We also compared the performance of pretrain-finetuning S&R\nFoundation model 𝑀𝑆&𝑅\n𝐹𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 with the performance of training\nsingle domain model without transfer learning.\n3 EXPERIMENT\nTo test the effectiveness of our proposed S&R Multi-Domain Foun-\ndation model, we want to answer the following questions:\n•RQ1: Whether our joint S&R Multi-Domain Foundation\nmodel can achieve SOTA performance compared to other\nmulti-domain and multi-task models?\n•RQ2: In terms of query and item towers’ representations,\nwhat’s the performance of the domain-invariant text fea-\ntures extracted by LLM and Aspect Gating Fusion network\ncompared to other methods?\n•RQ3: Whether S&R Multi-Domain Foundation and Super-\nvised Finetuning can help benefit cold start scenarios?\n3.1 Experimental Settings\n3.1.1 Dataset. We conducted extensive experiments of S&R Foun-\ndation model on real-world datasets, including 7 industrial datasets\nof Alipay Search Ranking and Query Recommendation. The sta-\ntistics are summarized in table 1. 𝑆 denotes the search dataset, in\nwhich users have explicit search query, such as Query-Item Rele-\nvance Prediction, Content Search Ranking, etc. And 𝑅denotes the\nrecommendation dataset, in which users don’t have explicit intent\nof search query. There are also some tasks between Search and\nRecommendation, which we classify as S/R, such as Query Suggest\nCTR Prediction, in which users have explicit query, and at the same\ntime the task is a CTR prediction task to make recommendation of\nquery suggestions to users.\n3.1.2 Comparison Methods. S&R Foundation ModelWe com-\npared our proposed S&R Multi-Domain Foundation model with\nSOTA multi-domain and multi-task models, such as Shared Bot-\ntom MTL [ 3], Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) [ 15], PLE\n[19], etc. For ablation study, we designed separate experiments to\nevaluate different modules of the framework, including the User-\nQuery-Item encoding module, Aspect Gating Fusion module and\nDomain Adaptive Multi Task module. The experiment of S&R Multi-\nDomain Foundation (MLP) denotes the concatenated user-query-\nitem representations are followed by multiple MLP layers. And\nthe experiment of S&R Multi-Domain Foundation-MMoE-DA-JS\ndenotes the representations are followed by a Domain Adaptive\nLayer (JS-Divergence) and MMoE multi-task module.\nDomain-Invariant Text Features and Aspect Gating Fu-\nsion To prove the effectiveness of adding domain-invariant text\nfeatures in S&R Foundation model, we have conducted experiments\nand ablation studies on different query and item token encoding\nmethods on Alipay Content Query Recommendation dataset of\ntasks 4 in table 1. In the baseline method, we intentionally leave out\nthe token-embedding of text features and only use ID and sparse fea-\ntures. We also compared randomly initialized token embedding with\nAn Unified Search and Recommendation Foundation Model for Cold-Start Scenario CIKM ’23, October 21–25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom\nTable 1: Statistics of Alipay Search Ranking and Query Recommendation Datasets.\nID Dataset S/R Train Eval Test #Query #Item\nTask 1 Query-Item Relevance Prediction S 76.2M 12.7M 12.7M 40K 40K\nTask 2 Query Suggest CTR Prediction S/R 145.4M 23.5M 23.5M 0.84M 0.16M\nTask 3 Background Word Query Recommendation CTR Prediction R 146.2M 24.3M 24.3M - 65K\nTask 4 Content Query Recommendation CTR Prediction R 0.76M 0.09M 0.09M - 4.6K\nTask 5 People Also Ask DeepSuggest S/R 2.4M 0.38M 0.38M 0.41M 25K\nTask 6 Service Card Recommendation S/R 1.01M 0.17M 0.17M 1.3K 1.6K\nTask 7 Content Search Ranking S 6.13M 1.03M 1.03M 0.27M 0.14M\nTable 2: Performance of S&R Multi-Domain Foundation Model.\nMethod Task1 Task2 Task3 Task4 Task5 Task6 Task7\nS&R Multi-Domain Shared Bottom [3] 0.6483 0.8993 0.7829 0.6575 0.8511 0.8015 0.8561\nS&R Multi-Domain MMoE [15] 0.6482 *0.9003 0.7812 0.6650 0.8463 0.7942 0.8599\nS&R Multi-Domain PLE [19] *0.7006 0.8981 0.7815 0.6682 0.8487 0.7978 0.8620\nS&R Multi-Domain Foundation (MLP) 0.6827 0.8974 0.7784 0.6683 0.8462 0.7926 0.8629\nS&R Multi-Domain Foundation-MMoE-DA-MMD 0.6874 0.8942 *0.7971 0.6793 0.8564 0.8203 0.8569\nS&R Multi-Domain Foundation-MMoE-DA-JS 0.6942 0.8973 0.7912 *0.6979 *0.8703 *0.8312 *0.8692\nAbsolute Improvement +0.0459 -0.0020 +0.0083 +0.0404 +0.0192 +0.0297 +0.0131\nTable 3: Comparison of Query and Item Token Encoding Methods after Fine-tuning Task 4.\nID Token Embedding Query/Item Encoder Finetune AUC\n1 Baseline: Without Token Emb - - 0.7524\n2 Randomly Initialized Mean Pooling - 0.7551\n3 Randomly Initialized Transfomer(L=1) True 0.7544\n4 Randomly Initialized Transfomer(L=6) True 0.7559\n5 SR Foundation (LM=Transformer) Transfomer(L=1) 𝐿0,𝐿1:True 0.7562\n6 SR Foundation (LM=Transformer) Transfomer(L=1) 𝐿0:False,𝐿1:True 0.7531\n7 SR Foundation (LM=Transformer) Transfomer(L=1) 𝐿0,𝐿1:False 0.7574\n8 SR Foundation (LM=BERT) BERT BASE(L=12) True 0.7563\n9 SR Foundation (LM=BERT) BERT BASE(L=12) False *0.7580\n10 SR Foundation (LM=ChatGLM 6B) ChatGLM 6B Pretrained LLM [8, 25] False 0.7518\n11 SR Foundation (LM=ChatGLM 6B) ChatGLM 6B Pretrained LLM [8, 25] + prompt False 0.7503\n12 SR Foundation (LM=ChatGLM2 6B) ChatGLM2 Pretrained LLM [8, 25] False 0.7502\nAbsolute Improvement - - +0.0056\n30\n 20\n 10\n 0 10 20 30\n10\n0\n10\n20\nS&R Foundation-MLP\ntask 1\ntask 2\ntask 3\ntask 4\ntask 5\ntask 6\ntask 7\n60\n 40\n 20\n 0 20 40\n60\n40\n20\n0\n20\n40\nS&R Foundation-MMoE-DA-MMD\ntask 1\ntask 2\ntask 3\ntask 4\ntask 5\ntask 6\ntask 7\n30\n 20\n 10\n 0 10 20 30\n30\n20\n10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nS&R Foundation-MMoE-DA-JS\ntask 1\ntask 2\ntask 3\ntask 4\ntask 5\ntask 6\ntask 7\nFigure 2: Visualization of SR Foundation Model’s Domain-Adaptive Layers\nTable 4: Comparison of Aspect Gating Fusion on Task 4.\nMethod AUC Absolute Gain\nMean-Pooling 0.7385 -\n[CLS]-Gating 0.7515 +0.0130\nDomain-Gating *0.7524 +0.0139\nTable 5: Comparison of Cold Start Scenarios Task 4 and 6.\nService Card Rec Content Query Rec\nSingle Domain 0.8229 0.7295\nSR Fdt->Finetune 0.8446 0.7574\nAbsolute Improvement +0.0216 +0.0279\nCIKM ’23, October 21–25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom Yuqi Gong et al.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nDays\n0.024\n0.026\n0.028\n0.030\n0.032\n0.034PVCTR\nOnline A/B T esting Service Card Recommendation PVCTR\nBaseline\nSR Foundation-Finetune\nFigure 3: Online AB Testing PVCTR Performance of Service\nCard Recommendation.\nembedding restored from the pretrained S&R foundation model\nunder different configurations. For the encoders, we compared\nmean pooling, randomly initialized Transformer, BERT, ChatGLM-\n6B[8, 25], and ChatGLM+prompt, etc. In methods 10-12, we adopt\nChatGLM-6B and ChatGLM2-6B to encode the text features of\nquery and items. The implementation details are: we utilized the en-\ncoders of ChatGLM-6B and ChatGLM2-6B to convert the input text\nfeatures and corresponding prompts into 4096-dimensional vectors,\nwhich are followed by 2 MLP dense layers and further reduced to\n32-dimensional vectors. The prompt function used in our approach\nis defined as 𝑓𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡 (𝑋)= ”Extract keywords from sentence [X]”.\nTo compare different Aspect Gating Fusion methods, e.g. Mean-\nPooling, [CLS]-Gating, Domain-Gating, we conducted ablation stud-\nies and the results are listed in table 4.\nSupervised Fine-Tuning on Cold Start ScenariosFor cold\nstart scenarios, we compared the performance of supervised fine-\ntuning (SFT) the foundation model using downstream dataset, with\nthe method of training single domain model on several tasks, in-\ncluding Service Card Recommendation (task 6) and Content Query\nRecommendation (task 4) as in table 5.\n3.2 Experimental Results\n3.2.1 S&R Multi-Domain Foundation model. To compare the per-\nformance of different multi-domain models, we report AUC perfor-\nmance on 7 search and recommendation datasets in table 2. All the\nexperimented models share same input features, User-Query-Item\nEncoding module, and Domain-Gating as Aspect Gating Fusion\nstrategy. The baseline for the multi-task learning (MTL) module\nis the shared bottom model. MMoE-DA-MMD and MMoE-DA-JS\nrepresent models that utilize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)\nand Jensen–Shannon Divergence (JS-Divergence) to constrain the\ndistributions of domain adaptive layers respectively. The asterisk (*)\ndenotes the best performance achieved in each task, and the abso-\nlute improvement represents the absolute improvement of MMoE-\nDA-JS method compared to baseline. MMoE-DA-JS achieved best\nperformance on 4 tasks: 4, 5, 6, 7 with AUC improvement of +0.0404,\n+0.0192, +0.0297, +0.0131 respectively. The domain-adaptive layer\nconstrains the embedding representations from different domains\nin the common vector space. The t-SNE visualization of S&R Foun-\ndation model’s domain-adaptive layers is depicted in Figure 2. The\nembedding depicted in the first subplot \"S&R Foundation MLP\" is\nscattered, and the embedding in the third subplot \"S&R Foundation-\nMMoE-DA-JS\" is coherently aligned.\n3.2.2 Domain-Invariant Text Features and Aspect Gating Fusion.\nWe report the performance of different methods to encode domain-\ninvariant text features and freeze-finetune split in table 3 on task 4\nContent Query Recommendation. Our proposed method of restor-\ning pretrained parameters from BERT BASE (12 layers Transformer)\nin S&R Foundation, freezing the parameters of the encoder and\nfinetuning the remaining networks achieves the best AUC perfor-\nmance 0.7580, which is 0.0056 absolute gain over baseline model.\nComparing different freeze-finetune split (methods 5-7), we can see\nthat freezing pretrained parameters in level 𝐿0 and 𝐿1 (method 7)\nachieves better performance than other split methods (method 5/6),\nwhich is 0.0043 absolute gain in AUC. As for the ablation studies\nof Aspect Gating Fusion in table 4, the baseline is to simply mean\npooling three aspects: ID, text and sparse features. We can see the\nDomain-Gating achieves best AUC performance 0.7524, which is\n0.0139 absolute gain over mean-pooling method.\n3.2.3 Supervised Finetuning in Cold Start Scenarios. To prove the\neffectiveness of finetuning our pretrained S&R Foundation model,\nwe compared cold start performance of two scenarios, Service Card\nRecommendation (task 6) and Content Query Recommendation\n(task 4). They are new scenarios and we only collected a few samples\nin a short period of time. The samples are splitted as we leave out\nlast one day’s collected data for testing, and use the remaining data\nfor fine-tuning the S&R Foundation. We also train the single domain\nmodel as the baseline. From table 5, we can see the fine-tuned S&R\nFoundation model achieves +0.0216 AUC improvement over single\ndomain model on task 6 and +0.0279 AUC improvement on task 4.\n3.2.4 Online AB Testing. To further prove the effectiveness of on-\nline performance in cold start scenario, we deployed the fine-tuned\nS&R Foundation model online in Service Card Recommendation\nscenario, and compared with baseline, which is the single domain\nDNN model. The results of the AB Testing from day 1 to day 7\nare depicted in Figure 3. The key performance measurement of the\ncold start scenario is PVCTR (Page View Click Through Rate). And\nwe observed that the fine-tuned S&R Foundation model achieved\n+17.54% relative gain in PVCTR over baseline. The online AB Test-\ning results showed that our method achieved better performance\nthan baseline consistently in cold start scenario.\n4 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we study the problem of training search and rec-\nommendation tasks jointly as the S&R Multi-Domain Foundation\nmodel, and use domain adaptation techniques to benefit cold start\nscenario. Our proposed model learns user, query and item repre-\nsentations, applies LLM to encode domain invariant text features\nand Aspect Gating Fusion to merge ID, text and sparse features. We\nalso conducted extensive experiments on finetuning the foundation\nmodels in cold start scenarios, which achieves better performance\nthan the single domain model. The fine-tuned S&R Multi-Domain\nFoundation model has been successfully deployed online in Alipay’s\nmultiple search and recommendation scenarios.\nAn Unified Search and Recommendation Foundation Model for Cold-Start Scenario CIKM ’23, October 21–25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom\nREFERENCES\n[1] Qingyao Ai, Yongfeng Zhang, Keping Bi, Xu Chen, and W.
