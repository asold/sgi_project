In Boston, the Well-child Care Visit, Evaluation, \nCommunity Resources, Advocacy, Referral, Education\n \nstudy \ntook place in paediatric clinics. 26 A waiting room survey \nscreened for social needs and members of the healthcare \nteam provided information on community resources, \nadding less than 2\n min \nto the visit. At 1\n month, \n20% of the \nintervention group parents reported contacting a referred \ncommunity resource versus 2.2% of parents in the control \ngroup.\n27 The online tool, HelpSteps,28 29 screens for a much \nlarger number of social needs, taking on average 25\n min to\n \ncomplete, with 90% of users identifying at least one social \nneed and 96% reporting they would recommend its use \nto a friend or peer.\n30 The California iScreen study,31 also \ntested in paediatric clinics, used the Health Leads32 model \nand found that social needs can be identified and providing \npatient supports led to improvements in parent-reported \nchild health.\n33 In Canada, a paper-based clinical tool has \nhelped train physicians and other health providers to \nconsider poverty as a health issue.\n34 This tool has been \nadapted by the College of Family Physicians of Canada for \nuse in all provinces and territories. No studies to date have \nevaluated the impact of this tool on providers or patients.\nOur study focuses on developing, implementing and \nevaluating an online tool in primary care settings that \nfocuses on access to financial benefits. This study emerges \nfrom an ongoing collaboration between family physicians, \nresearchers and a charitable financial literacy organisation, \nProsper Canada.\n35 This paper describes the protocol for \nthis mixed-methods study that will evaluate the implemen-\ntation and impact of this online tool. Our study will assess: \n(1) whether health providers find using a tool to address \naccess to financial benefits in a clinical setting feasible and \nacceptable; (2) lessons learned and opportunities iden-\ntified to integrate the tool within the regular workflow of \nprimary healthcare organisations\n \nand (3) feedback from \npatients using the online tool and the short-term impacts \non awareness and access to benefits.\nM\nE\nth\nO\nds/d\nE\nsign\nThis study will use qualitative and quantitative methods \nto evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using an \nonline tool in primary care to address access to financial \nbenefits. The online income tool will be implemented \nat six primary care clinics, three in Toronto, Ontario \nand three in Winnipeg, Manitoba. All sites serve large \nnumbers of patients with complex health needs and low \nsocioeconomic status (table\n \n1).\ni\nntervention\nThe intervention is centred on an online tool that guides \nusers through 12 demographic and income-related ques-\ntions and subsequently generates a customised list of rele-\nvant provincial and federal government benefits and tax \ncredits. The initial screening question ‘Do you ever have \ndifficulty making ends meet at the end of the month?’ \nhas been validated in similar settings to identify patients \nwho live below the Canadian poverty line with 98% sensi-\ntivity and 64% specificity.\n36 Further questions were deter-\nmined based on the eligibility criteria for various federal \nand provincial benefits and tax credit programme. The \ntool was first used at a community health centre and with \na family health team in Toronto for 1\n month to identify \ntechnical problems. Following feedback sessions with \nproviders, modifications \nwere made to the tool to improve \nits overall design for use in this study.\ns\ntudy procedures\nAn orientation session will be held at each site to intro-\nduce primary care providers to the tool and enrol them in \nthe study as participants. Following this session, the tool \nwill be implemented for a 3-month period. The tool can \nbe used by any member of the healthcare team, including \nphysicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, patient navigators \nand social workers. Each site will have some flexibility in \nhow the tool will be implemented into the routine work-\nflow of patient care, based on input from providers at the \nsite. Health providers will be encouraged to use the tool \nwith every patient seen. The tool can also be used in an \nopportunistic way when patients share a health concern \nthat is linked to low income. Patients who consent to \nparticipate in the study can then use the tool with their \nhealth provider. At this time, study sites do not have a \nformal, systematic way to identify low-income patients. To \nminimise bias by providers or reception staff, all patients \nwho present for care in these clinics will be approached. \nThis intervention was not randomised because excluding \nlow-income patients from receiving information on \neligible benefits and accessing additional income supports \nwould be unethical. Moreover, the topic may come up in \nany given appointment depending on the nature of the \nvisit. Given the limited time during appointments at some \nsites, family physicians will screen patients for low income \nand refer them to a care coordinator (eg, social worker) \nto complete the tool (figure\n \n1).\nParticipants\nProviders\nThe six clinics testing the tool will introduce the pilot \nstudy to healthcare providers and interested providers \nwill be consented to participate.

BMJ Open 2017;7:e015947. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2017-015947\nOpen Access  \ndetermine study sample calculations for future clinical \ntrials and the usage and length of time to complete the \ntool will be monitored.\n37 Of those patients who complete \nthe tool and survey, a subset will be contacted for \nfollow-up. The target sample size for 1-month follow-up \nis 200 patients in each province for a total of 400 patients. \nWe anticipate that this sample size will be robust enough \nto determine the acceptability of using the tool, as well \nas provide data on impact that will allow for sample size \ncalculation for future studies of the impact of such tools \non income itself.\nQuantitative data collection\nOnline tool output\nWe will collect a set of data points on each use of the \ntool. We will not be able to distinguish repeat users. The \ntool will record answers to the following demographic \nquestions: age, immigration status, employment status, \nwhether someone in the household has a disability, house-\nhold income and how many people live in the household \nand any existing benefits or tax credits received by the \npatient. The tool will also track clinic site, start time and \nend time of use, benefits recommended (output of tool) \nand proportion of users who complete the tool.\nPatient surveys\nAt the end of the tool, patients will be asked to complete \na brief survey on their experience of using the tool and \nto provide contact information if interested in being \ncontacted in the future. This survey will capture whether \npatients found the tool helpful, whether they would \nrecommend the tool to a friend or family member and \nwhether they understood the information provided to \nthem. Lastly, the survey will use a Likert scale for patients \nto mark their confidence in taking next steps based on \nthe information provided to them following their initial \nuse of the tool with providers. Since there are no stan-\ndardised instruments for evaluating this type of interven-\ntion the research team developed surveys to learn about \npatient perceptions of the tool after immediate use. At \nthe end of the tool, we will ask patients’ permission to \nhave a research coordinator follow-up with them via tele-\nphone or email to conduct a structured interview 1\n month \nafter their use of the tool in the clinic. This subset will be \na convenience sample of all patients who provide their \ncontact information and consent to an inter\nview.\nQualitative data collection\nProvider focus groups and survey\nThree months after participating in the online income \ntool pilots, providers will be asked to complete an online, \nanonymous survey about their experience of using the \ntool. The purpose of this survey is to understand the \nproviders’ perspective on whether they would use the \ntool in the future and whether they would recommend it \nto a colleague. Surveys will also capture how many times \nproviders used the tool, whether providers felt they had \nenough time to do the tool with their patients, as well \nas the biggest benefit and drawback of using the tool, \nrespectively. Providers at each site will also participate in \na focus group discussion that explores the use of the tool \nover the last 3\n months and the barriers and facilitators to \nimplementation. Focus groups will provide a setting for \nin-depth discussion around the tool’\ns integration into \nregular clinical workflow, suggestions for its improve-\nment, provider attitudes about addressing poverty in \nprimary care, as well as factors that inhibited use of the \ntool during piloting at each site. A set of questions will be \nused to guide the focus groups and the discussions will be \naudiorecorded and transcribed verbatim.\nProvider observations and feedback\nDuring the 3-month\n \nperiod of pilot testing the online \nincome tool at three sites in Winnipeg and Toronto, \nrespectively, the use of the tool and its accompanying feed-\nback from study team members and participating staff is \nbeing collected on an ongoing basis. Analytics regarding \nthe number of times the tool is being used at each site \nare recorded and shared with study team members on a \nweekly basis and any feedback shared about the tool in \ninformal conversations during site visits, through email \nor interim reports is noted in a feedback matrix that will \nbe used when developing the tool in preparation for its \nnext phase of use.\nAnalysis plan\nQuantitative analysis\nThe primary outcome of this study is patient and provider \nperceptions around the integration of a tool addressing \nincome in primary care settings (assessed through \npatient surveys, telephone interviews with patients at \n4 weeks, provider focus groups and provider surveys). \nAdditional outcomes that will be measured include \npatient access to financial benefits 4 weeks after their use \nof the tool (assessed through telephone interview at 4 \nweeks) (table\n \n2). Descriptive statistics will be calculated \n(counts, percentages, means) to summarise variables \nincluding patient characteristics, usage of the tool and \npatient outcomes for all six sites. Outcome measures will \nbe dichotomous and a bivariate analysis (using Student \nt-tests and χ\n2 tests, as appropriate) will be performed \nto determine associations between patient characteris-\ntics recorded from the tool and outcome measures (eg, \nwhether programme was helpful, whether the patient is \nconfident in taking next steps and whether their finan-\ncial situation improved). Independent variables associ-\nated with positive patient outcomes and negative patient \noutcomes will be analysed separately.

Two \nteam members will independently read and code tran-\nscripts using Dedoose V.7.0.23 (SocioCultural Research \nConsultants, Los Angeles, California,\n USA). \nThemes will \nbe refined in an iterative process by comparing codes \nwith the research team and reaching consensus on a final \ncoding framework. The thematic analysis will focus on \nidentifying key facilitators and barriers to implementa-\ntion and provider perspectives on the impact of the tool \nand ways to improve similar tools. Field notes collected \nthroughout the study will help contextualise findings for \neach site and identify similarities and differences across \nsites. Open-ended questions from patient and provider \nsurveys will also be thematically coded and categorised. \nWe will identify common experiences associated with \nusing the tool that may provide insight into how the tool \nworks and ways to improve similar tools in the future.\nAdvisory group\nWe will organise an advisory committee made of up \npatients, community agencies and staff to provide \nongoing feedback on the project. Our aim is to engage \nfour to six patients to provide input on how to improve \nthe online tool and its use in clinical settings. For this \nstudy, the advisory committee will play an important \nrole in understanding how to improve the tool interface \nand what information will be most useful for patients to \nimprove the tool output. The advisory committee will \nmeet approximately once a month beginning in July \n2016 until the end of data collection to help interpret \nfindings, make recommendations to the online tool and \nsuggestions for integrating its use within the care team. \nOngoing engagement with patients and stakeholders will \nhelp to determine modifications to the tool, contextualise \nour findings and promote greater uptake in the future.\n39\nEthics and dissemination\nThis study has been approved by St Michael’s Hospital \nResearch Ethics Board, the Health Research Ethics Board \nat the University of Manitoba and the Michael Garron \nHospital Research Ethics Board. Informed consent will \nbe obtained for all study participants. Data collected by \nthe online tool will be anonymous, with no link between \nanswers to questions in the tool and personal identifying \ndata. Some patients may feel discomfort when asked \nthe screening question and they may feel shame or fear \nstigma if they are experiencing income insecurity. We will \nattempt to lessen this possibility by encouraging health \nproviders to normalise the experience for patients, for \nexample, “I’m asking many of my patients this question \nover the next 3 months”. Patients may feel obligated to \ncomplete the tool with their healthcare providers. During \ntraining sessions, all providers will be asked to emphasise \nthat this intervention is optional and not part of routine \ncare. Patients will also be informed that they can stop \nusing the tool at any time. Healthcare providers will also \nbe trained to manage patient expectations by stating that \nthis tool may or may not identify benefits which could \nprovide increased income. All patient and provider \nsurveys will be anonymised. Finally, participants in focus \ngroups will not be identified by name and all transcripts \nwill be anonymised during transcription.\nThis study uses an ‘upstream’ approach to address a \nroot cause of poor health outcomes: poverty. By exploring \nthe feasibility and acceptability of using an online tool we \ncan establish a standardised process to screen patients \nfor low income in routine primary care settings. We will \nalso examine and report on local factors that influence \nimplementation at the different clinic sites. Moreover, \nthe implementation of the tool will be pragmatic, with \nthe ultimate aim to bring such tools into broader practice \nthrough integration into primary healthcare settings. The \nfindings from this study will provide insight into individ-\nual-level interventions to address the social determinants \nof health in primary care. Such tools may be useful to \na diversity of primary care providers and could be appli-\ncable to other healthcare settings, such as in discharge \nplanning at healthcare institutions. Important strengths \nof the intervention include opportunities for providers \nto offer feedback on the content, design and overall \nusability of the tool and the follow-up with patients about \nchanges in their financial situation. Patients and commu-\nnity agencies represented in the advisory group will help \nensure that this study remains focused on patient-centred \noutcomes and experiences and will contribute particular \nperspectives to the interpretation of our findings.\nWe will evaluate the implementation and short-term \neffects of this online income security tool within six health \nclinics. We will attempt to engage a broad representation \nof health providers at each site and will invite all staff to \nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . by guest on November 5, 2025 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from 22 October 2017. 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-015947 on BMJ Open: first published as \n6\nAery A, et al.

The information provided in \nthe output of the tool may not be suitably tailored to the \nneeds of all individuals. The time frame of this study does \nnot permit us to examine health effects, which we would \nanticipate would take longer than 1\n month to develop, \nand which would require a more intense inter\nvention. \nFuture research could examine whether using this tool, \nin coordination with other services, with patients iden-\ntified as being at risk of developing complex health \nand social needs could impact on health and health \nservice use.\n2 40 The hypothesis tested would be that that \naddressing income security may reduce the risk of poor \nhealth and high service use for some patients.\nThere are several limitations to the proposed the study. \nFirst, the study uses a convenience sampling method so \nparticipants who declined to use tool or could not be \nreached at follow-up were not captured. Second, the \nsites chosen to pilot the tool were already interested in \naddressing income security at their clinics. Furthermore, \nall site materials were in English so findings may not be \ngeneralisable to other clinical settings. Lastly, while we \nanticipate that the tool will be able to identify benefits \nthat a patient could be eligible for, the complex process \nof applying for benefits may be a barrier to improving \nincome security and a 1-month follow-up may be too short \nof a time frame within which to assess impact. However, \nthis is one of the few studies on SDOH interventions that \nfollows up with patients and a major strength is imple-\nmenting the tool across multiple sites in two provinces.\nThis study is timely as awareness and a commitment \nto act on the SDOH is growing within the health sector \nin Canada\n6 22 41 42  and globally. 43–45 Continuing medical \neducation events on poverty and health have been estab-\nlished and new medical school curricula is being created.\n46 \nThese efforts may begin to change medical practice. Yet, \nthere are few studies that have evaluated the implemen-\ntation and impact of such initiatives. The findings of this \nstudy will contribute to the design of SDOH interventions \nin healthcare, particularly when considering the role of \ntechnology and the practical challenges of incorporating \ninterventions into busy health organisations.\nAuthor affiliations\n1Wellesley Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n2The Upstream Lab, Centre for Urban Health Solutions, Li Ka Shing Knowledge \nInstitute, St Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n3Department of Family Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, Winnipeg, \nManitoba, Canada\n4Department of Family and Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of \nToronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n5Department of Family and Community Medicine, St Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, \nOntario, Canada\n6Central Toronto Community Health Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n7Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health Systems, Toronto, Ontario, \nCanada\n8Division of Clinical Public Health, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of \nToronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n9South East Toronto Family Health Team, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n10Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\ntwitter\n @AndrewDPinto @upstreamlab\nAcknowledgements\n W\ne gratefully acknowledge all our collaborators at Prosper \nCanada, particularly Adam Fair, Marlene Chiarotto and Layla Rich, without whom \nthis work would not be possible.
