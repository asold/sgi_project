  "abstract": "Mechanical parts manufactured using additive manufacturing (AM) processes are used in various fields, such as the aerospace, automobile, and machine tool fields. Recently, many researchers have been actively researching AM processes, owing to their advantages in fabricating complex-shaped components that are difficult to process using conventional processes such as rolling, forging, and casting. One of the AM processes, wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), is widely used for manufacturing and repair. Mechanical parts usually suffer from severe damage, such as wear and cracks, during operation. Therefore, research on the damaged parts is often required for repairs. This study was performed to investigate the repair of damaged parts using WAAM in machine tool remanufacturing. In general, these parts are often damaged owing to falls of the workpieces and the inexperience of workers; the cross slide is one of the parts damaged most often in a lathe. Accordingly, this study used the cross slide as an example. First, the damaged area was partially cut flat. Second, it was filled with a metal wire using WAAM. Third, post-processing was performed to adjust the surface quality and shape accuracy. Then, the microstructure, chemical composition, and mechanical property of the repaired part were analyzed. Finally, the repaired cross slide was used to replace damaged parts. In general, this method can be applied to various mechanical parts such as impellers, turbine blades, and machine tools.",
