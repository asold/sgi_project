  "abstract": "1 examining our original work, \"Evaluating Chatbot Efficacy for Answering Frequently Asked Questions in Plastic Surgery: A ChatGPT Case Study Focused on Breast Augmentation.\" 2 We applaud the authors for their notable statements and concur wholeheartedly with their assertions.Recent strides in artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased the impressive potential of large language models (LLMs) within surgical disciplines, including plastic surgery. 3AI has been received as a disruptive force by the medical community, although it has generated remarkable leaps and bounds in assisting with the diagnosis of medical conditions and their treatment strategies.With the inception of AI-driven LLMs, such as ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), BARD (Google, Mountain View, CA), and BingAI (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), we located a potential space of entry to patient care in our recent case report on ChatGPT for responses to common questions for breast reconstruction.We evaluated the response of 3 prominent LLMs on 2 questions about breast augmentation (Supplemental Figures 1 and2, available online at www. aestheticsurgeryjournal.com).When prompted to exhibit how LLMs could inform patients on breast augmentation, ChatGPT-4 explained scenarios in which it might solve general inquiries and facilitate questions for surgeons from perioperative to postoperative stages, as did BARD at a similar but less comprehensive level, while BingAI suggested links to less reliable sources, such as phillips.com.To the second query on future advancements in breast augmentation, ChatGPT-4 responded with insights that, although already known, addressed the topic effectively.Both ChatGPT-4 and BingAI touched upon the crucial aspect of ongoing research into monitoring the safety of breast",
