  "abstract": "Operation of voltage transformer in grids with distorted signals Non-sinusoidal currents and voltages caused by nonlinear loads appear in power grids more and more frequently. Determination of the voltage transformer accuracy in such conditions makes a problem. Firstly, due to lack of definition of errors for distorted signals and secondly, typical measurement bridges do not accept higher harmonics. In the paper, the new definition of transformation error for distorted voltages has been proposed and some measurement results have been presented.",
