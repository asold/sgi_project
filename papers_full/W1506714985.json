    "abstract": "The grid connection transformer is one of the most expensive components of a wind farm development. If a transformer is under-utilised, this indicates that the initial capital outlay on the transformer was excessive. Overloading can lead to accelerated aging and increased losses. This project will investigate whether it is possible, by understanding the load profiles and stress conditions in a wind farm environment, to overload a transformer above its nameplate rating, thus reducing the capital outlay costs in developing a wind farm. The paper will investigate a specific wind farm overloading scenario and examine whether it is feasible, and financially viable, to overload the transformer beyond its nameplate rating.",
