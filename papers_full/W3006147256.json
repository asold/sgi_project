In order to address this dilemma, we\ndeveloped a smart paper transformer (s-PAT) to support nanocatalysts, based on easy phase conversion\nbetween paper and pulp, for the ﬁrst time. The pulp phase was used to maintain the high catalytic\neﬃciency of the nanocatalysts and the transformation to paper enabled their high reusability. Herein, as\nan example of smart paper transformers, a novel chromatography paper-supported Au nanosponge\n(AuNS/pulp) catalyst was developed through a simple water-based preparation process for the\nsuccessful reduction ofp-nitrophenol to demonstrate the high catalytic eﬃciency and reusability of the\nnoble metal nanocatalyst/pulp system. The composition, structure, and morphology of the AuNS/pulp\ncatalyst were characterized by XRD, TGA, FE-SEM, ICP, TEM, FT-IR, and XPS. The AuNS/pulp catalyst was\ntransformed into the pulp phase during the catalytic reaction and into the paper phase to recover the\ncatalysts after use. Owing to this smart switching of physical morphology, the AuNS/pulp catalyst was\ndispersed more evenly in the solution. Therefore, it exhibited excellent catalytic performance forp-\nnitrophenol reduction. Under optimal conditions, the conversion rate ofp-nitrophenol reached nearly\n100% within 6 min and thek value of AuNS/pulp (0.0106 s\n/C0 1) was more than twice that of a traditional\nchromatography paper-based catalyst (0.0048 s/C0 1). Additionally, it exhibited outstanding reusability and\ncould maintain its high catalytic eﬃciency even after ﬁfteen recycling runs. Accordingly, the unique\nphase switching of this smart paper transformer enables Au nanosponge to transform into a highly\neﬃcient and cost-e ﬀective multifunctional catalyst. The paper transformer can support various\nnanocatalysts for a wide range of applications, thus providing a new insight into maintaining both high\ncatalytic e ﬃciency and reusability of nanocatalysts in the ﬁelds of environmental catalysis and\nnanomaterials.\nIntroduction\nNanomaterials have attracted increased attention in multiple\ndisciplines due to their unique size and shape eﬀects.1–4 As an\nimportant member of nanomaterials, noble metal nano-\ncatalysts (Au nanoclusters, Pd nanoparticles, Pt nanoparticles,\netc.) have widespread applications in many elds, such as\nenvironmental catalysis,\n5–7 photothermal therapy,8–10 carbon–\ncarbon coupling reactions,11–13 etc. Among these applications,\ntheir use in environmental catalysis is of signicant importance\ndue to its ecological value, specically in water treatment. So\nfar, Fe3O4@SiO2–Ag,14 Au@SiO2,15 Au/TiO2,16 AgNPs/SiNSs,17 Pd/\nC3N4,18 and many other noble metal nanocatalysts have been\nused for water treatment. However, the selection of noble metal\ncatalysts oen faces a dilemma: it is diﬃcult to achieve both\nhigh catalytic eﬃciency and high reusability at the same time.\nCatalysts for water treatment can be divided into two categories:\nliquid-phase catalysts and solid-phase catalysts. Liquid-phase\ncatalysts exhibit high catalytic eﬃciency, but it is challenging\nto separate them from wastewater aer use. For instance, Au/\nTiO\n2, Au colloidal solutions and water-soluble Pd-8 nano-\nclusters exhibited high catalytic performance forp-nitrophenol\n(4-NP) reduction but were diﬃcult to recover, resulting in low\nreusability.19–21 On the other hand, solid-phase catalysts have\nhigh reusability but the catalytic eﬃciency is substantially lower\nthan that of liquid phase catalysts.22 Although Pd/MoS2 can be\naDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso,\nTexas 79968, USA.

Fe3O4 supported\nnoble metal nanocatalysts (Au –Fe3O4@MOF,26 Pt–Fe3O4@-\ngraphene27), which controlled the recycling process with their\nmagnetic properties, were reported in some literature to exhibit\nboth high catalytic eﬃciency and reusability. Lignin supported\nAg (Ag@LPAH) also exhibited high catalytic e ﬃciency and\nstability.28 However, their complex preparation processes and\nthe high cost limit their applications. Although the synergistic\neﬀects between Ag, Au, and CuO resulted in excellent catalytic\nperformance for the catalytic reduction ofp-nitrophenol, the\nreusability was still limited (3 cycles) and Au –Ag/CuO still\nneeded to consume a lot of precious metals and metal oxides.\n29\nAs an active ingredient, the Au nanomaterial is an excellent\nelectron donor or acceptor, so it has the capacity to promote\ncatalytic reactions by the redox cycle process signicantly. It\nalso exhibits excellent chemical inertness and can remain stable\nunder various reaction conditions.\n30 Therefore, Au nano-\nmaterials are excellent catalysts in catalytic reactions.31 Among\ndiﬀerent Au nanostructures, the Au nanosponge (AuNS) has\na three-dimensional open architecture exposing a large number\nof catalytically active sites.32 The large surface-to-volume ratio\nand the presence of numerous active sites are bene cial\nresulting in superior catalytic activity.33 In addition, unlike\nAuNPs,34 AuNS does not require the addition of protective\ncapping agents to avoid aggregation. The properties and char-\nacteristics of AuNS result in the formation of a robust and high-\neﬃciency catalyst.\nAlong with catalysts, catalyst carriers, such as graphene\noxide,\n35 TiO2,36 polymers37 and cellulose, also play a vital role in\neﬃcient catalytic reactions.38 Chromatography paper consisting\nof cellulose microstructures (micro-sized diameter) can be used\nas a 3D catalyst carrier with highly eﬀective surface areas.\n39,40\nFurthermore, the paper has the unique property where its liquid\n(i.e. pulp) and solid phases can be easily and reversibly\nswitched. When paper is transformed into pulp, the pulp can be\nuniformly suspended in water increasing the contact area\nbetween catalysts and reactants, and hence improving the\ncatalytic eﬃciency. On the other hand, when the pulp is dried, it\nwill become the solid phase ( i.e. the so-called paper). The\ncatalyst is captured on the solid paper and thus can be easily\nrecovered. The paper-supported catalysts can be used many\ntimes by repeating this process, allowing for excellent reus-\nability. Thus, the smart paper transformer (s-PAT) provides an\nextraordinary solution to address a vital problem of current\nnoble metal catalysts by unifying both high eﬃciency and high\nreusability. That is to say, chromatography paper orlter paper\nis an excellent catalytic carrier for noble metal nanocatalysts.\nFurthermore, paper has abundant–OH functional groups on\nthe cellulose surface which ensure strong binding strength\nbetween paper and Au nanomaterials and that the nanocatalyst\ncannot be washed away. Although chromatography paper has\nbeen used as a catalyst carrier before,\n41,42 the unique phase-\ntransformation properties of paper (switching easily between\npaper and pulp) have not been utilized.\nGiven the aforementioned features of s-PAT, the smart paper\ntransformer can enable chromatography paper supported noble\nmetal nanocatalysts such as AuNS (AuNS/pulp) to exhibit high\ncatalytic eﬃciency and high reusability. To verify the hypoth-\nesis, the catalytic reduction of p-nitrophenol (4-NP), a water\npollutant, was chosen as a model for the application of the\nAuNS/pulp catalyst in water treatment. It is well known that 4-\nNP is a signicant contributor to worsening environmental\nproblems such as water contamination resulting in mutagens,\nteratogens, carcinogens, etc.\n43 Alternatively, p-aminophenol (4-\nAP), the catalytic reaction product, is an important intermediate\nwith widespread applications in variouselds including anti-\npyretic drugs, photographic developers, corrosion inhibitors,\nand hair-dying agents.\n44–46 With the increase of environmental\nprotection awareness and increasingly strict environmental\nprotection laws,29 developing new eﬃcient and economical\ntechnologies to degrade 4-NP has great ecological and envi-\nronmental signi cance and important economic value.\n47,48\nHerein, s-PAT was used to support AuNS for the catalytic\nreduction of nitroaromatic compounds. A series of character-\nization tests conrmed that the AuNS/pulp catalyst exhibits not\nonly higher catalytic eﬃciency than various solid-phase cata-\nlysts, but also higher reusability than liquid phase catalysts. The\nconversion rate of 4-NP reached nearly 100% within 6 min\nunder optimal conditions while the catalytic e ﬃciency\nremained high even aer 15 recycling runs. The microstructure\nof the chromatography paper was retained during the processes\nof AuNS preparation and catalytic reactions. This discovery\nprovides a new platform to seek eﬃcient and economical cata-\nlysts for various applications in environmental remediation,\nbiomass conversion, nanomaterials, and so on.\nExperimental\nMaterials\nSodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%) was purchased from Alfa\nAesar (Tewksbury, MA). p-Nitrophenol (4-NP) was purchased\nfrom EMD Millipore Corporation (Billerica, MA).

Secondly, 16 pieces of chromatography paper (138 mg) and\nthe HAuCl\n4 solution were mixed together in a 20 mL vial and\nmaintained under vigorous stirring for 4 h in the dark. The pulp\nwas formed aer stirring. Thirdly, 90 mg of NaBH4 was dis-\nsolved into 3 mL ultrapure water. Then the NaBH4 solution was\nadded into the pulp rapidly under continuous vigorous stirring\nfor 1 h to completely reduce Au\n3+ to Au0. Finally, the resulting\nblack pulp suspension was washed and centrifuged three times\nwith water to obtain purple pulp with AuNS in it. Aer this the\npulp was dried at 60\n/C14 C for 6 h and the s-PAT supported Au\ncatalyst was obtained and stored at room temperature before\nuse.\nCatalytic activity measurement\nThe catalytic e ﬃciency of the s-PAT supported AuNS/pulp\ncatalyst was investigated by applying it in 4-NP conversion to\np-aminophenol (4-AP). Firstly, an appropriate amount of the\nAuNS/pulp catalyst was dissolved in 3 mL ultrapure water and\nstirred for 30 min so that the AuNS/pulp catalyst could take the\nform of pulp. Secondly, the 4-NP solution (1 mM, 5 mL) and\na fresh NaBH\n4 solution (0.1 M, 5 mL) that was stored in\na refrigerator were added to the vial and mixed together. Then,\nthe mixed solution was added into the pulp suspension rapidly\nwhile vigorously stirring. Aerward, 100 mL mixed solutions\nwere pipetted into a 96 well microplate (Thermo Fisher Scien-\ntic, America). The absorbance spectra of the solutions in the\nmicroplate were obtained using a multi-mode microplate reader\n(Microplate Reader M3, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). The\nvalue of total organic carbon (TOC) was recorded using a total\norganic carbon analyzer. The remaining fraction of 4-NP (X) was\ncalculated using eqn (1).\nX ¼ C\nt/C0 /C2 100% (1)\nwhere C0 is the initial 4-NP concentration and Ct is the\nconcentration at diﬀerent time intervals (t). Furthermore, the\nAuNS/pulp catalyst was recycled 16 times to investigate the\nreusability. For each recycling, the used catalyst was washed,\ncentrifuged and dried for the next experiment.\nCharacterization\nX-ray diﬀraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X-ray\ndiﬀractometer (Empyrean Series 2, PANalytical, Netherlands).\nThe scan speed was 5\n/C14 $min/C0 1 and the 2q scans covered 10–85/C14 .\nThe microstructural nature was investigated using a eld\nemission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hita-\nchi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL,\nJEM-2010UHR). The element distribution was investigated by\nelectron mapping. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra\nwere obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 670 series FT-IR spectro-\nphotometer in ATR mode. The spectra were recorded under\nambient conditions over the range of 750 –4000 cm\n/C0 1 with\na resolution of 0.5 cm/C0 1. Thermogravimetric analysis was per-\nformed using a TGA system (Mettler Toledo International Inc,\nAmerica). Before the test, the sample was dried at 80\n/C14 C for 2 h\nand a ceramic crucible was pre-treated by a high-temperature\nsintering process. The 0.5 mg sample was placed in the\nceramic crucible and kept in the auto-sampler of the TGA\nsystem. Then the sample was heated from 30\n/C14 C to 800/C14 Ca t\na5 /C14 C min/C0 1 heating rate. The gasow rate of the nitrogen\natmosphere was 20 mL min/C0 1. The X-ray photoelectron spec-\ntroscopy (XPS) patterns were acquired using a PHI 5600 spec-\ntrometer with a hemispherical energy analyzer (Mg-K a\nradiation, 1253.6 eV), and the vacuum degree was maintained at\n10\n/C0 7 Pa. The samples were dried at 80/C14 C for 24 h to remove\nmoisture and then were tested without surface treatment.

The fading time related to the catalytic reduction of\n4-NP to 4-AP decreased with the increase of the catalyst amount.\nAs a result, the eﬀect of the catalyst amount was investigated by\nUV-Vis spectrophotometry (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1(a)–(d), the\nintensity of the representative peak of 4-NP in the presence of\nNaBH\n4 at 400 nm decreased and that of the representative peak\nof 4-AP at 295 nm increased gradually with time. Early literature\nalso conrmed that the peaks at 400 nm and 295 nm repre-\nsented 4-NP and 4-AP, respectively.\n49 The linear relationship\nbetween the absorbance and 4-NP concentration was calculated\nbased on Fig. S1.† It was also noted that the value of TOC\nshowed no noticeable changes at diﬀerent times (Fig. S2†),\nindicating the transformation from 4-NP to 4-AP instead of the\nbenzene ring when the AuNS/pulp catalyst was added into the 4-\nNP/NaBH\n4 solution. However, there were no obvious spectral\nchanges at 400 nm in the absence of the AuNS/pulp catalyst or\nin the presence of only the chromatography paper (i.e. no AuNS)\nin the reaction solution (Fig. 1(b) and (c) insets), though the\nslight decrease in Fig. 1(c) was observed at the beginning of the\nreaction due to the physical adsorption on the porous paper\nmaterial. A visual inspection of this experiment also shows that\nScheme 1 Schematic of the preparation (left) and application (right)\nprocesses of the s-PAT supported AuNS/pulp catalyst.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Chem.

The catalytic eﬃciency decreased gradually\nwhen the AuNS/pulp amount decreased from 54 to 13 mg.\nFig. 1(d) shows the 4-NP conversion over time with varying\namounts of the catalyst. The conversion rate reached 89.1%\nwithin 2 min and nearly 100% within 5 min when the amount of\nthe AuNS/pulp catalyst was 54 mg. This conversion rate was\nhigher than that in many previous reports.\n51,52 When the\namount of the AuNS/pulp catalyst decreased to 27 mg, the\ncatalyst still exhibited satisfactory catalytic reactions and the\nconversion rate could still reach 98.3% within 6 min. The high\ncatalytic eﬃciency of the AuNS/pulp catalyst was largely attrib-\nuted to the porous structure of the AuNS and the uniform\ndistribution of the AuNS catalyst in solutions by the pulp phase\nof the s-PAT. It is known that the porous structure could\npromote the adsorption and activation of reactive molecules on\nthe active sites of the catalyst, thereby improving the catalytic\nperformance. However, solid-phase catalysts oen fail to ach-\nieve high eﬃciency due to the lack of uniform distribution of\ncatalysts. A more detailed comparison of the catalytic eﬃciency\nbetween the pulp phase and the paper phase will be discussed\nin the following section of this article.\nThe catalytic reduction reaction from 4-NP to 4-AP follows\nrst-order kinetics because of the excessive amount of NaBH\n4.\nThe kinetics was calculated using eqn (2).\nln(Ct/C0) ¼/C0 kt (2)\nwhere C0 is the initial 4-NP concentration,Ct is the concentra-\ntion at diﬀerent time intervals (t) and k is the apparent rate\nconstant of the reaction. Fig. 1(d) shows therst-order kinetic\ncurves of 4-NP over AuNS/pulp with diﬀerent catalyst amounts.\nThe data points followed basic linearity, which was slightly\ndiﬀerent from that in previous literature.\n41 This was a result of\nvigorous stirring during the catalytic reactions eliminating\nbubbles produced in the vial. Thus, it prevented bubbles from\nblocking the interaction between the catalyst and reactants.\nFurthermore, the catalytic performance improved with the\nincrease of the AuNS amount so that the value ofk was 0.0158,\n0.0106 and 0.0068 s\n/C0 1 for 54, 27 and 13 mg catalysts, respec-\ntively. However, considering the eﬃciency and the cost, 27 mg\nwas chosen as the optimum catalyst amount.\nTo investigate the eﬀect of the NaBH4 concentration on\ncatalytic activity, UV-vis absorption spectra for diﬀerent NaBH4\nconcentrations were collected and the results are shown in\nFig. S3† and 2. As shown in Fig. S3,† the reaction time increased\ngradually with the decrease of the NaBH4 concentration. When\nthe concentration of NaBH4 was 0.01 M, the catalytic eﬃciency\nwas very low taking about 25 min for the reaction to be\nFig. 1 UV-vis absorption spectra of 4-NP reduction in the presence of (a) 54 mg AuNS/pulp catalyst, (b) 27 mg AuNS/pulp catalyst, and (c) 13 mg\nAuNS/pulp catalyst.

When the NaBH4 concentration was increased from\n0.01 M to 0.05 M (NaBH 4/4-NP molar ratios of 10 to 50,\nrespectively), the reaction time decreased to 9 min. However,\nincreasing the NaBH\n4/4-NP molar ratio to higher than 100 did\nnot have a signicant eﬀect on the catalytic eﬃciency. For\ninstance, when the NaBH4 concentrations were 0.20 and 0.10 M\n(the molar ratios were 200 and 100), the corresponding reaction\ntimes were 4 and 6 min, respectively. Fig. 2 displayed therst-\norder kinetic curves of 4-NP over AuNS/pulp with diﬀerent\nNaBH\n4 concentrations. It can be observed that the NaBH 4\nconcentration could aﬀect the catalytic eﬃciency signicantly,\nespecially when the molar ratio was less than 100. The value ofk\nincreased from only 0.0029 s /C0 1 to 0.0049 s /C0 1 when the\nconcentration of NaBH4 was increased from 0.01 to 0.05 M. On\nthe other hand, no great changes were observed with the\nincrease of the 4-NP concentration (Fig. S4†). The diﬀerence in\nreaction time was only within 1–2 min when the 4-NP concen-\ntration was increased exponentially. In other words, the NaBH\n4\nconcentration and not the 4-NP concentration was the main\ninuencing factor when the other conditions were the same.\nTherefore, it can be speculated that therst step of the trans-\nformation from 4-NP to 4-AP (Au transfers NaBH\n4 to active\nhydrogen species) was the key process to control the reaction\ntime during the catalytic reduction.\nCatalytic eﬃciency and reusability of the paper transformer-\nsupported nanocatalysts\nAlthough solid-phase catalysts can be readily recycled due to\ntheir high reusability, they have a lower catalytic eﬃciency than\nliquid-phase catalysts due to the amount of time it takes for the\nreactants to reach the catalyst surface. The s-PAT's trans-\nformation from the paper phase to the pulp phase enables\nuniform distribution of catalysts in a solution, providing solid-\nphase catalysts with a smart strategy for high-eﬃciency catal-\nysis. Table S1† lists the correlated data of 4-NP reduction under\ndiﬀerent conditions. Both the catalytic e ﬃciency and the\neconomic cost would increase correspondingly with higher\ncatalyst amounts and higher NaBH\n4 concentrations. The\nincrease of the 4-NP concentration could reduce the economic\ncost but it would increase the reaction time. Considering both\ncatalytic eﬃciency and economic factors, 27 mg of the catalyst,\n0.10 M NaBH\n4, and 1 mM 4-NP were determined to be optimum\nconditions. Under the optimal conditions, the conversion rate\ncould reach 95% within 4.5 min and nearly 100% within 6 min.\nTo compare the reported data for the catalytic reduction ofp-\nnitrophenol, diﬀerent catalysts are shown in Table 1.\n53–55 The k\nvalue of AuNS/pulp was calculated using 13 mg catalyst and the\nvalue was found to be 0.0068 s\n/C0 1. It can be observed that the\ncatalytic eﬃciency was higher if the catalysts (such as Au/\nSnNb2O6) could be evenly dispersed in water while the reus-\nability was better for the solid-phase catalysts (e.g. graphene/\nPDA-Au, Ni@PtNi NSc-rGO, and Ag/CH-FP). Among these cata-\nlysts, only our AuNS/pulp catalyst exhibited both high catalytic\neﬃciency (k value 0.0068 s\n/C0 1) and outstanding reusability (15\nrecycling runs). In other words, the smart switching between\npulp and paper guaranteed the combination of high catalytic\neﬃciency and outstanding reusability of the AuNS/pulp catalyst\nplatform. As shown in Fig. 1(d), by increasing the catalyst\namount or the NaBH\n4 concentration, higher catalytic eﬃciency\nFig. 2 (a) TheCt/C0 and (b) ln(Ct/C0) vs. time plots in the presence of diﬀerent concentrations of NaBH4 over the AuNS/pulp catalyst.\nTable 1 Comparison of the catalytic conditions and eﬃciency of the AuNS/pulp with reported dataa\nCatalyst TOF (min /C0 1) k (s/C0 1) 4-NP ( mmol)\nNaBH4/4-NP\nratio\nTemperature\n(/C14 C)\nMetal amount\n(mmol) Recycling runs Ref.\nAuNS/pulp 0.158 6.8 /C2 10/C0 3 5 100 RT 21.1 15 This work\nAu/SnNb2O6 0.106 19.4 /C2 10/C0 3 4.3 767 RT 10.1 — 53\nGraphene/PDA-Au 0.384 3.7 /C2 10/C0 3 1 1320 RT 0.2 — 54\nNi@PtNi NSc-rGO — 4.5 /C2 10/C0 3 0.5 1000 24.8 — 55 5\nAg/CH-FP 0.008 3.9 /C2 10/C0 3 2 100 RT 21.3 5 41\na TOF: turnover frequency.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Chem.

Furthermore, our AuNS/pulp\ncatalyst reduced a greater amount of 4-NP, while allowing the\ncatalyst to retain high catalytic eﬃciency even aer many recy-\ncling runs. This is a signicant advantage of our s-PAT sup-\nported AuNS/pulp catalyst.\nAs mentioned earlier, the s-PAT can be easily switched\nbetween the pulp and the solid paper phases. Paper being\na porous material has been used to support various nano-\nmaterials, increasing the reaction kinetics, and has also been\nused as a carrier for other related applications.\n56,57 For instance,\npaper supported Ag took advantage of the porous characteris-\ntics and exhibited impressive catalytic performance.\n41 To\nconrm the superior performance of the s-PAT to that of solid\npaper, we also compared diﬀerent catalytic performances in 4-\nNP catalytic reduction between the s-PAT supported AuNS/pulp\nand the solid paper supported AuNS/paper.\nFig. 3 displays the diﬀerent UV-vis absorption spectra for 4-\nNP reduction by the AuNS/pulp and AuNS/paper catalysts. It can\nbe seen that 4-NP reduction was completed within 6 min by\nusing AuNS/pulp, whereas it needed 18 min to be completed in\nthe presence of AuNS/paper, which implies that the catalytic\neﬃciency of the s-PAT supported AuNS/pulp was 300% higher\nthan that of the solid-phase Au/paper catalyst. The AuNS/pulp\ncould be evenly suspended in the whole reaction solution so\nthat it signi cantly improved the chances of coming into\ncontact with 4-NP in the solution, while the 4-NP reaction in\nFig. 3(b) was limited by the regionally localized AuNS catalyst on\npaper which sank to the bottom of the solution. It can be\nconcluded that even though both reactions contained the same\namount of Au, the s-PAT supported AuNS/pulp made full use of\nthe AuNS catalyst. In contrast, AuNS/paper, due to the restric-\ntion of nanocatalysts in a limited space in the solution, could\nnot achieve full catalytic eﬃciency. According to the ln(C\nt/C0) vs.\ntime plot in Fig. 3(c), thek value (0.0106 s/C0 1) for AuNS/pulp was\n2.2 fold higher than that for AuNS/paper (0.0048 s/C0 1), further\nindicating the improved catalytic performance of the s-PAT\nsupported AuNS/pulp compared to the solid paper supported\nAuNS/paper.\nBoth catalytic eﬃciency and reusability are important for\nindustrial applications. As discussed earlier, liquid-phase cata-\nlysts usually provide high catalytic eﬃciency (such as Au/Fe\n3-\nO4@TiO2 and58 Ag@carbon59), but it is extremely challenging to\nseparate them from wastewater and recycle them for reuse. The\nAuNS/pulp catalyst provides a solution for this problem. When\ndried and transformed into the paper phase, the catalyst can be\neasily separated from wastewater for reuse, ensuring high\nreusability. Therefore, aer investigating the high eﬃciency of\nthe s-PAT supported catalyst, we further explored the reusability\nof the s-PAT supported AuNS catalyst. As shown in Fig. S5† and\n4(a), the fresh AuNS/pulp catalyst achieved 98.3% conversion\nwithin 6 min and its apparent rate (k value) was 0.0106 s\n/C0 1.A er\nfour recycling runs, the catalyst could still exhibit almost the\nsame eﬃciency as the fresh one. Thek value of the AuNS/pulp\ncatalyst in the h cycle (0.0102 s\n/C0 1) remained almost the\nsame as that of the fresh catalyst. The catalytic eﬃciencies at\n7 min reached 96.3% and 91.6% in the tenth andeenth\ncycles, respectively. On the other hand, most other solid cata-\nlysts can be reused for justve or ten cycles and the catalytic\neﬃciency usually decreases below 90% or 85%.\n26,50 Hence, the s-\nPAT supported AuNS/pulp catalyst exhibits excellent reusability\nand has enormous potential for various industrial applications.\nAlthough the AuNS/pulp catalyst exhibited excellent reus-\nability, a slight decrease in catalytic eﬃciency was observed with\nincreased recycling runs. As shown in Fig. 4(a), thek value\ndecreased from 0.0077 to 0.0056 s\n/C0 1 from the 10th to the 15th\ncycles. The decrease of the catalytic eﬃciency was likely due to\nthe detachment of AuNS from the catalyst support, which was\nconrmed in Fig. S6.† We also used ICP to verify the Au content\n(0.47 mg L/C0 1) in the supernatant aer the catalytic reaction\n(Table S2†). The catalyst loss would cause the catalyst eventually\nto become a waste catalyst aer many recycling runs. In our\nresearch, it was determined that a fresh catalyst became a waste\ncatalyst aer 16 recycling runs. Furthermore, we investigated\nthe regeneration feasibility of a waste catalyst. For the regen-\neration of a waste catalyst, 45 mg waste catalyst and 4 mg\nHAuCl\n4$3H2O (4.4 wt% AuNPs) were added into 3 mL water to\nobtain the pulp solution under vigorous stirring. Then a NaBH4\nsolution (3 mg NaBH4 in 3 mL water) was quickly added to the\npulp suspension to completely reduce Au3+ with vigorous stir-\nring for 1 h. Finally, the as-prepared black suspended paper\nbers were centrifuged and washed three times with water to\nobtain the purple pulp. Aer the purple pulp was dried at 60\n/C14 C\nfor 6 h, the waste AuNS/pulp catalyst was regenerated.\nFig. 4(b) and S7† show the catalytic comparison for 4-NP\nreduction using the fresh, 16-time recycled, and regenerated\nAuNS/pulp catalysts. The waste catalyst ( i.e. 16 cycle runs)\ncompleted the catalytic reaction within 12 min and the 4-NP\nconversion reached 85.3% at 6 min. Its apparent rate (k value)\nwas only 0.0055 s\n/C0 1. However, the regenerated catalyst achieved\n98.4% within 6 min, and itsk value was recovered to 0.0104 s/C0 1.\nFig. 3 UV-vis absorption spectra for 4-NP reduction using the (a)\nAuNS/pulp and (b) AuNS/paper catalysts.

Thus, the high catalytic\neﬃciency can be recovered by loading a small quantity (4.4 wt%)\nof AuNS on a waste catalyst. In other words, the outstanding\nregeneration capacity of the AuNS/pulp catalyst further\nenhances its reusability. In summary, the s-PAT supported\nAuNS/pulp catalyst exhibits not only high catalytic eﬃciency but\nalso outstanding reusability and regeneration capacity.\nSEM and TEM analysis\nWe also performed FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, FT-IR, and XPS to\ncharacterize the composition, structure, and morphology of the\ns-PAT supported AuNS/pulp catalyst. Fig. 5 and S8† show the FE-\nSEM and TEM micrographs of the chromatography paper and\nthe fresh AuNS/pulp catalyst. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the\nchromatography paper consisted of many long bers with\na smooth surface. From the measurement, the diameter of the\nber was found to be about 10–20 mm. As observed in Fig. 5(c)\nand (d), the Au nanosponge had a porous structure like\na sponge and the size of the AuNS was about 50–100 nm. AuNS\nnanostructures clumped together and were entwined around\nlong paper bers. In addition, some smaller Au nanoparticles\nwere embedded in the paper bers, and their sizes were\nbetween 5 and 14 nm (Fig. S8†). The nano-size and porous\nstructure of AuNS facilitated catalyst adsorption and activation\nof reactive molecules, thereby increasing catalyst activity. From\na comparison between Fig. 5(a) and (c), it can be observed that\nthe ber surface of AuNS/pulp was not as smooth as that of\nchromatography paper, but the major microstructure looked\nsimilar between pulp and paper bers. Some white spots\nemerged from the chromatography paper but did not appear on\nthe AuNS/pulp surface. The main reason was that the conduc-\ntivity of the chromatography paper increased aer the growth of\nAuNS. In addition, SEM was employed for element mapping on\nthe chromatography paper and the AuNS/pulp. Fig. S9 and S10†\nshow the element mapping results of the chromatography\npaper and the fresh AuNS/pulp catalyst. It can be observed that\nthe C and O elements were well distributed on the chromatog-\nraphy paper surface. Aer AuNS preparation on paper, Au was\ndistributed on the AuNS/pulp surface, conrming the existence\nand the distribution of AuNS in the pulp.\nXRD and FT-IR analysis\nThe XRD patterns of the chromatography paper, the fresh AuNS/\npulp catalyst, and the used AuNS/pulp catalyst (reused 10 times)\nwere analyzed and the results are shown in Fig. 6(a). The crys-\ntallinity and crystallite size were calculated using the Debye–\nScherrer equation (MDI Jade 5.0 soware). All the reections of\nthe samples provided the diﬀraction patterns for cellulose (PDF-\nICDD 50-2241) and Au (PDF-ICDD 04-0784). As shown in\nFig. 6(a), the three strong peaks at 2q ¼ 14.99\n/C14 , 16.49/C14 , and\n22.78/C14 were attributed to cellulose ( /C0 110), (110) and (200)\ndiﬀractions, respectively. The peaks at 38.18/C14 , 44.39/C14 , 64.58/C14 ,\nand 77.54/C14 corresponded to the gold (111), (200), (220) and (311)\ndiﬀractions. This, therefore, suggested that the chromatog-\nraphy paper consisted of crystalline cellulose. The crystallinity\nand crystallite size of cellulose crystals were 88% and 7 nm,\nrespectively. In addition, the crystallinity and crystallite size of\ncellulose crystals exhibited no signicant change when AuNS\nwas prepared on the chromatography paper. In other words, the\nFig. 4 (a) ln(Ct/C0) vs. time plot for diﬀerent recycling runs over the AuNS/pulp catalyst and (b)Ct/C0 vs. time plot of the fresh, waste and\nregenerated catalysts.\nFig. 5 SEM micrographs of (a) and (b): chromatography paper; (c) and (d): fresh AuNS/pulp.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Chem.

The intensity of the cellulose peak decreased\nslightly for the used AuNS/pulp catalyst compared to the fresh\nAuNS/pulp catalyst, suggesting a small amount of cellulose loss\naer use. Finally, obvious Bragg reections of Au were observed\non the fresh AuNS/pulp surface and the crystallinity and the\ncrystallite size of Au were 95% and 18 nm, respectively. The\ncrystallinity and crystallite size of AuNS also showed no obvious\nchange aer use, suggesting high reusability of the AuNS/pulp\ncatalyst.\nFig. 6(b) shows the FT-IR spectra of the chromatography\npaper, the fresh AuNS/pulp, and the used AuNS/pulp catalyst\n(750–4000 cm\n/C0 1). It can be seen that the FT-IR spectra from the\nchromatography paper and the fresh and used catalysts were\nsimilar to each other and all the peaks were attributed to\ncellulose I. From the literature, the 3352 cm\n/C0 1 and 2901 cm/C0 1\npeaks were attributed to O–H and C–H stretching vibrations,\nrespectively.60,61 The bands at 1431 cm /C0 1, 1319 cm/C0 1, and\n1282 cm/C0 1 were assigned to symmetric CH2 bending, CH2\nwagging, and C–H bending.62,63 The bands at both 1236 cm/C0 1\nand 1202 cm/C0 1 were assigned to C–O–H bending in plane at C-\n6.63,64 The bands at both 1165 cm/C0 1 and 897 cm/C0 1 were assigned\nto C–O–C stretching at theb-glucosidic linkage.65 The bands at\nboth 1032 cm/C0 1 and 983 cm/C0 1 were assigned to C–O stretching\nvibrations at C-6.66 Fig. 6(b) also demonstrates that the peak\nintensity decreased slightly with the addition of AuNS or aer\nuse. This is due to the decrease in the relative amount of\ncellulose, which was consistent with the XRD results. However,\nno peak shi was observed, suggesting that the AuNS prepara-\ntion process did not alter the original interactions among\ncellulose chains. In other words, the porous microstructure of\nthe chromatography paper showed no change aer the AuNS\npreparation process, which was favourable for maintaining\nhigh catalytic eﬃciency aer many recycling runs (see Fig. 4(a)),\nas discussed in an earlier section of this article.\nTGA analysis\nFig. 7 displays the TGA thermograms of the chromatography\npaper, the fresh AuNS/pulp, and the used AuNS/pulp catalyst.\nNo weight loss was observed until the temperature increased to\n250\n/C14 C due to the sample being dried before each measurement\nto eliminate moisture. An obvious weight loss was observed in\nthe temperature range from 250 to 600/C14 C. This was attributed\nto the decomposition of, oxidation of, and evolution of gases\nfrom the main organic components (cellulose).41,42 In addition,\nthe degradation temperature of the AuNS/pulp catalyst\ndecreased to 263\n/C14 C, while that of chromatography paper was\n295 /C14 C. The shi of the degradation temperature may be due to\nAuNS acting as a catalyst and decreasing the activation energy\nduring the thermal event.\n67–69 In addition, the weight loss of the\nchromatography paper increased to 90.9% while that of the\nfresh AuNS/pulp and used AuNS/pulp catalysts increased to\n61.8% and 58.3%, respectively. This diﬀerence is due to the\npresence of AuNS in the fresh AuNS/pulp and used AuNS/pulp\ncatalysts. Therefore, the amount of AuNS in the AuNS/pulp\ncatalyst could be deduced from the diﬀerence of the weight\nloss. It was noted that the fresh AuNS/pulp and the used AuNS/\npulp contained 32 wt% and 36 wt% AuNS, respectively. This is\nbecause there was a small amount of cellulose loss, leading to\nan increase in the relative amount of AuNS aer many cycles of\nreuse.\nXPS analysis\nThe surface composition and oxidation states of catalysts play\nan important role in the catalytic reduction reaction, so XPS was\nFig. 6 (a) X-ray diﬀraction patterns and (b) FT-IR spectra of the chromatography paper and AuNS/pulp catalysts.\nFig. 7 TGA thermograms of the chromatography paper and the AuNS/\npulp catalyst.\n2922 | Chem.

The O\n1s peaks were deconvoluted into three peaks, two of which\ncorresponded to cellulose: the peak centered at about 533.1 eV\nwas attributed to the oxygen in ether groups (hereaer denoted\nas O\nc) and the other peak centered at about 532.8 eV was\nattributed to the oxygen atoms in alcohol groups (hereaer\ndenoted as Ob).70 Furthermore, a relatively well-developed peak\nlocated between 530.4 eV and 532.8 eV could be attributed to the\npresence of either loosely bound oxygen or hydroxide (OH\n/C0 ,\nhereaer denoted as Oa).71 The intensities of the O 1s peaks\ndecreased because the relative content of oxygen decreased aer\nthe AuNS preparation process. In addition, the O 1s peaks of\nAuNS/pulp showed a shi toward higher binding energy aer\nthe AuNS preparation process, indicating that there was\na strong interaction between Au and O atoms. The strong\ninteraction also guaranteed that the AuNS catalyst would not be\nwashed away from the chromatography paper aer use.\nAs shown in Fig. 8(c), the C 1s spectrum was divided into four\npeaks: (1) the peak located at 284.7 eV was attributed to the\ncarbon bond to carbon (C–C, C\n1); (2) the peak located at 285.3 eV\nwas attributed to the sp3 carbon bond to hydrogen atoms (C–O,\nC2); (3) the peak located at 286.2 eV was attributed to the\ncellulose carbon bond to a single oxygen (C]O, C3); (4) the peak\nlocated at 288.0 eV was attributed to the cellulose carbons bond\nto two oxygen atoms (O –C]O, C\n4).49 Similarly, AuNS\npreparation on paper caused a decrease in the intensity of the C\n1s peaks and the shi toward a higher binding energy. In other\nwords, there was strong interaction among Au, C and O atoms.\nFig. 8(d) shows the Au 4f XPS spectrum of the AuNS/pulp cata-\nlyst. The strong doublet peaks of Au 4f emerging at 87.6 eV and\n83.9 eV were attributed to Au\n0 4f5/2 and Au0 4f7/2, respectively.\nThere was also no other peak ascribed to Au3+, illustrating that\nthe reduction of Au3+ to Au0 was complete aer the AuNS\npreparation process. These observations revealed that Au0 was\nthe predominant species in the AuNS/pulp catalyst.\nTable 2 lists the atomic ratios on the surface of the chroma-\ntography paper and the fresh AuNS/pulp catalyst. For the O\nelement, the noticeable change was the decrease of hydroxide\n(O\na). The relative content of both Ob and Oc increased slightly but\nt h ei n c r e a s eo fOc was not so obvious. That is, the AuNS prepa-\nration process resulted in a decrease of hydroxide on the chro-\nmatography paper surface. For the C element, the relative content\nof C\n3 increased obviously and that of C1,C 2 and C4 decreased\naer the AuNS preparation process, leading to diﬀerent electron\nstates in those diﬀerent environments. We speculate that the\natomic ratio changes were due to the reaction between the C–C\nbond and hydroxide adsorbed on the chromatography paper\nsurface during the AuNS preparation process. In addition, the\nhydroxyl group of the C–Ob o n dw i l la l s ob ec o n s u m e dd u r i n gt h e\nAuNS preparation process. Therefore, the cleavage of the C–Ca n d\n–OH bond and the formation of the C]Ob o n do c c u r r e dd u r i n g\nthe AuNS preparation stage, resulting in atomic ratio changes.\nHowever, according to the other data, the overall structure of the\nchromatography paper was maintained during the AuNS prepa-\nration process.\nFig. 8 (a) Survey, (b) O 1s, (c) C 1s and (d) Au 4f XPS high-resolution scan spectra of diﬀerent catalyst samples.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Chem.

Aer systematic studies\nof the composition, structure, and morphology of the AuNS/pulp\ncatalyst by diﬀerent characterization techniques such as XRD,\nTGA, FE-SEM, TEM, FT-IR, and XPS, the s-PAT supported AuNS/\npulp was successfully used for eﬃcient catalytic reduction of 4-\nNP with high reusability. The porous microstructures of the AuNS\nand paper and the uniform distribution of the AuNS catalyst in\na solution by the s-PAT liquid phase all contributed to the high\ncatalytic eﬃciency of the AuNS/pulp catalyst, while the trans-\nformation to the solid phase of s-PAT enabled exceptional reus-\nability and regeneration capacity.\nNotably, for therst time, we developed a novel noble metal\nnanocatalyst platform on a smart paper transformer based on the\nsmart phase conversion of paper and demonstrated excellent\ncatalytic eﬃciency and reusability of the platform in environ-\nmental catalytic applications. The smart transformation between\nthe liquid phase of pulp and the solid phase paper of the s-PAT\nsupported noble metal nanocatalysts ensures not only high\ncatalytic eﬃciency but also excellent reusability. For instance, the\nconversion rate of 4-NP reached nearly 100% within 6 min under\noptimal conditions. The comparison between the AuNS/pulp and\nAuNS/paper catalysts indicated superior catalytic eﬃciency of the\ns-PAT supported AuNS/pulp compared to AuNS/paper. Further-\nmore, s-PAT can maintain high catalytic eﬃciencies even aer\nmany cycles of reuse. The AuNS/pulp catalyst still exhibited\nah i g hc a t a l y t i ceﬃciency of 91.6% within 7 min in theeenth\ncycle of reuse for 4-NP reduction. Liquid-phase catalysts can\nexhibit high catalytic eﬃciency but not good reusability. In\ncontrast, solid-phase catalysts can easily achieve high reusability\nbut not high catalytic eﬃciency. Therefore, this innovative phase\ntransformation solves a vital problem in the currenteld of\ncatalysis by fusing high eﬃciency and outstanding reusability in\nthe same nanocatalyst and sheds light on e ﬃcient and\neconomical catalysis for manyelds ranging from environmental\nremediation and organic synthesis to biomass conversion and\nlarge-scale industrial applications.\n72\nConﬂicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to acknowledge thenancial support from the\nU.S. NSF-PREM program (DMR 1827745).
