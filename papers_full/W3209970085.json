In\nparticular, vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance on the large scale ImageNet\nbenchmark [9], while exhibit excellent scalability with the further growing dataset size (e.g., on JFT-\n300M [11]). These models split each image into a ﬁxed number of patches and embed them into 1D\ntokens as inputs. Typically, representing the data using more tokens contributes to higher prediction\naccuracy, but leads to intensive computational cost, which grows quadratically with respect to the\n∗Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding author.\n35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.\narXiv:2105.15075v2  [cs.CV]  26 Oct 2021\ntoken number in self-attention blocks. For a proper trade-off between efﬁciency and effectiveness,\nexisting works empirically adopt 14x14 or 16x16 tokens [11, 55].\nTable 1: Accuracy and computa-\ntional cost of T2T-ViT-12 with dif-\nferent token numbers on ImageNet.\n# of Tokens14x14 7x7 4x4\nAccuracy 76.7% 70.3% 60.8%\nFLOPs 1.78G 0.47G 0.21G\nIn this paper, we argue that it may not be optimal to treat all\nsamples with the same number of tokens. In fact, there exist\nconsiderable variations among different images (e.g., contents,\nscales of objects, backgrounds, etc.). Therefore, the number of\nrepresentative tokens should ideally be conﬁgured speciﬁcally\nfor each input. This issue is critical for the computational\nefﬁciency of the models. For example, we train a T2T-ViT-12\n[55] with varying token numbers, and report the corresponding accuracy and FLOPs in Table 1.\nOne can observe that adopting the ofﬁcially recommended 14x14 tokens only correctly recognizes\n∼15.9% (76.7% v.s. 60.8%) more test samples compared to that of using 4x4 tokens, while increases\nthe computational cost by 8.5x (1.78G v.s. 0.21G). In other words, computational resources are\nwasted on applying the unnecessary 14x14 tokens to many “easy” images for which 4x4 tokens are\nsufﬁcient.\nEasyHard\n97.3%Apple\n21.4%Egret86.9%Egret\n15.2%Palace43.7%Palace91.4%Palace\n…… …\nTerminate&Output\nContinueReuseComputation\nFigure 1: Examples for DVT.\nMotivated by this observation, we propose a novel Dy-\nnamic Vision Transformer (DVT) framework, aiming to\nautomatically conﬁgure a decent token number conditioned\non each image for high computational efﬁciency. In spe-\nciﬁc, a cascade of Transformers are trained using increas-\ning number of tokens. At test time, these models are se-\nquentially activated starting with less tokens. Once a pre-\ndiction with sufﬁcient conﬁdence has been produced, the\ninference procedure will be terminated immediately. As a\nconsequence, the computation is unevenly allocated among\n“easy” and “hard” samples by adjusting the token number,\nyielding a considerable improvement in efﬁciency. Impor-\ntantly, we further develop feature-wise and relationship-\nwise reuse mechanisms to reduce redundant computations.\nThe former allows the downstream models to be trained on\nthe basis of previously extracted deep features, while the\nlater enables leveraging existing upstream self-attention\nrelationships to learn more accurate attention maps. Illus-\ntrative examples of our method are given in Figure 1.\nNotably, DVT is designed as a general framework. Most of the state-of-the-art image recognition\nTransformers, such as ViT [11], DeiT [38], and T2T-ViT [55], can be straightforwardly deployed as\nits backbones for higher efﬁciency. Our method is also appealing in its ﬂexibility. The computational\ncost of DVT is able to be adjusted online by simply adapting the early-termination criterion. This\ncharacteristic makes DVT suitable for the cases where the available computational resources ﬂuctuate\ndynamically or a minimal power consumption is required to achieve a given performance. Both\nsituations are ubiquitous in real-world applications (e.g., searching engines and mobile apps).\nThe performance of DVT is evaluated on ImageNet [9] and CIFAR [26] with T2T-ViT [55] and DeiT\n[38]. Experimental results show that DVT signiﬁcantly improves the efﬁciency of the backbones. For\nexamples, DVT reduces the computational cost of T2T-ViT by 1.6-3.6x without sacriﬁcing accuracy.\nThe real inference speed on a NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU is consistent with our theoretical results.\n2 Related Work\nVision Transformers. Inspired by the success of Transformers on NLP tasks [10, 40, 3, 43], vision\nTransformers (ViT) have recently been developed for image recognition [11]. Although ViT by itself\nis not comparable with state-of-the-art convolutional networks (CNN) on the standard ImageNet\nbenchmark, it attains excellent results when pre-trained on the larger JFT-300M dataset. DeiT [38]\nstudies the training strategy of ViT and proposes a knowledge distilling-based approach, surpassing\nthe performance of ResNet [19]. Some following works such as T2T-ViT [55], TNT [17], CaiT [39],\nDeepViT [62], CPVT [6], LocalViT [28] and CrossViT [5] focus on improving the architecture design\nof ViT. Another line of research proposes to integrate the inductive bias of CNN into Transformers\n[49, 8, 54, 16]. There are also attempts to adapt ViT for other vision tasks (e.g., object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, etc.) [ 30, 44, 12, 20, 57, 60, 14]. The most majority of these concurrent\n2\nworks represent each image with a ﬁx number of tokens. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nﬁrst to consider conﬁguring token numbers conditioned on the inputs.\nEfﬁcient deep networks. Computational efﬁciency plays a critical role in real-world scenarios, where\nthe executed computation translates into power consumption, carbon emission or latency. A number\nof works have been done on reducing the computational cost of CNNs [22, 33, 21, 53, 59, 31, 35].\nHowever, designing efﬁcient vision Transformers is still an under-explored topic. T2T-ViT [ 55]\nproposes a light-weighted tokens-to-token module and obtains a competitive accuracy-parameter\ntrade-off compared to MobileNetV2 [ 33]. LeViT [ 16] accelerates the inference of Transformer\nmodels by involving convolutional layers. Swin Transformer [ 30] introduces an efﬁcient shifted\nwindow-based approach in multi-stage vision Transformers. Compared to these models with ﬁxed\ncomputational graphs, the proposed DVT framework improves the efﬁciency by adaptively changing\nthe architecture of the network on a per-sample basis.\nDynamic models. Designing dynamic architectures is an effective approach for efﬁcient deep\nlearning [18]. In the context of recognition tasks, MSDNet and its variants [ 23, 52, 27] develop a\nmulti-classiﬁer CNN architecture to perform early exiting for easy samples. Another type of dynamic\nCNNs skips redundant layers [ 41, 45, 51] or channels [ 29] conditioned on the inputs. Besides,\nthe spatial adaptive paradigm [15, 4, 47, 42, 46] has been proposed for efﬁcient image and video\nrecognition. Although these works are related to DVT on the spirit of adaptive computation, they are\ndeveloped based on CNN, while DVT is tailored for vision Transformers.\nNotably, our work may seem similar to the multi-exit networks [ 23, 52, 27, 47] from the lens of\nearly-exiting. However, DVT differentiates itself from these existing works in several important\naspects. For example, a major efﬁciency gain in both MSDNet [ 23] and RANet [52] comes from\nthe adaptive depth, namely processing “easier” samples using fewer layers within a single network.\nIn comparison, DVT cascades multiple Transformers to infer several entire networks at test time.\nBesides, DVT does not leverage the multi-scale architecture or dense connection in MSDNet [23].\nCompared with RANet [52], DVT introduces the adaptive token number and the relationship reuse\nmechanism tailored for ViT. In addition, IMTA [27] studies the training techniques of multi-exit\nmodels, which are actually complementary to DVT. Another difference is that all these networks\n[23, 52, 27, 47] adopt pure convolutional models.\n3 Dynamic Vision Transformer\nVision Transformers [11, 17, 38, 55] split each 2D image into 1D tokens, while model their long\nrange interaction with the self-attention mechanism [40]. As aforementioned, to correctly recognize\nsome “hard” images and achieve high accuracy, the number of tokens usually needs to be large,\nleading to the quadratically grown computational cost. However, “easier” images that make up the\nbulk of the datasets typically require far fewer tokens and much less costs (as shown in Table 1).\nInspired by this observation, we propose a Dynamic Vision Transformers(DVT), aiming to improve\nthe computational efﬁciency of Transformers via adaptively reducing the number of representative\ntokens for each input.\nIn speciﬁc, we propose to deploy multiple Transformers trained with increasing number of tokens,\nsuch that one can sequentially activate them for each test image until obtaining a convincing prediction\n(e.g., with sufﬁcient conﬁdence). The computation is allocated unevenly across different samples for\nimproving the overall efﬁciency. It is worth noting that, if all the Transformers are learned separately,\nthe computation performed by upstream models will simply be abandoned once a downstream\nTransformer is activated, resulting in considerable inefﬁciency. To alleviate this problem, we introduce\nthe efﬁcient feature and relationship reuse mechanisms.\n3.1 Overview\nInference. We start by describing the inference procedure of DVT, which is shown in Figure 2. For\neach test sample, we ﬁrst coarsely represent it using a small number of 1D token embeddings. This\ncan be achieved by either straightforwardly ﬂattening the split image patches [11, 17] or leveraging\ntechniques like the tokens-to-token module [55]. We infer a vision Transformer with these few tokens\nto obtain a quick prediction. This process enjoys high efﬁciency since the computational cost of\nTransformers grows quadratically with respect to token number. Then the prediction will be evaluated\nwith certain criterion to determine whether it is reliable enough to be retrieved immediately. In this\npaper, early-termination is performed when the model is sufﬁciently conﬁdent (details in Section 3.3).\n3\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nRelationship Reuse Feature \nReuse\nVision Transformer\n✱\n✱…\n✱\nRelationship Reuse Feature \nReuse\nVision Transformer\nVision Transformer\n… … … …\nExit?

Under the objective of conﬁguring\nproper token numbers conditioned on the inputs, we cascade multiple Transformers with increasing\nnumber of tokens. At test time, they are sequentially activated until a convincing prediction (e.g.\nsufﬁciently conﬁdent) has been obtained or the ﬁnal model has been inferred. The feature and\nrelationship reuse mechanisms allow reusing computation across different Transformers.\nOnce the prediction fails to meet the termination criterion, the original input image will be split\ninto more tokens for more accurate but computationally more expensive inference. Note that, here\nthe dimension of each token embedding remains unchanged, while the number of tokens increases,\nenabling more ﬁne-grained representation. An additional Transformer with the same architecture\nas the previous one but different parameters will be activated. By design, this stage trades off\ncomputation for higher accuracy on some “difﬁcult” test samples. To improve the efﬁciency, the\nnew model can reuse the previously learned features and relationships, which will be introduced in\nSection 3.2. Similarly, after obtaining a new prediction, the termination criterion will be applied, and\nthe above procedure will proceed until the sample exits or the ﬁnal Transformer has been inferred.\nTraining. For training, we simply train DVT to produce correct predictions at all exits (i.e., each\nwith the corresponding number of tokens). Formally, the optimization objective is\nminimize 1\n|Dtrain|\n∑\n(x,y)∈Dtrain\n[∑\ni\nLCE(pi,y)\n]\n, (1)\nwhere (x,y) denote a sample in the training set Dtrain and its corresponding label. We adopt the\nstandard cross-entropy loss function LCE(·), while pi denotes the softmax prediction probability\noutput by the ith exit. We ﬁnd that such a simple training objective works well in practice.\nTransformer backbone. DVT is proposed as a general and ﬂexible framework. It can be built on\ntop of most existing vision Transformers like ViT [11], DeiT [38] and T2T-ViT [55] to improve their\nefﬁciency. The architecture of Transformers simply follows the implementation of these backbones.\n3.2 Feature and Relationship Reuse\nAn important challenge to develop our DVT approach is how to facilitate thereuse of computation.\nThat is, once a downstream Transformer with more tokens is inferred, it is obviously inefﬁcient if\nthe computation performed in previous models is abandoned. The upstream models, although being\nbased on smaller number of input tokens, are trained with the same objective, and have extracted\nvaluable information for fulﬁlling the task. Therefore, we propose two mechanisms to reuse the\nlearned deep features and self-attention relationships. Both of them are able to improve the test\naccuracy signiﬁcantly by involving minimal extra computational cost.\nBackground. For the ease of introduction, we ﬁrst revisit the basic formulation of vision Trans-\nformers. The Transformer encoders consist of alternatively stacked multi-head self-attention (MSA)\nand multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks [40, 11].

3: Illustration of the feature reuse mechanism. A layer-wise context embedding is learned\nbased on the ﬁnal representations output by the upstream model, i.e., zup\nL, and integrated into the\nMLP block of each downstream Transformer layer.\nconnection [19] are applied before and after each block, respectively. Let zl ∈RN×D denote the\noutput of the lth Transformer layer, where N is the number of tokens for each sample, and Dis the\ndimension of each token. Note that N = HW + 1, which corresponds to H×W patches of the\noriginal image and a single learnable classiﬁcation token. Formally, we have\nz′\nl = MSA(LN(zl−1)) +zl−1, l ∈{1,...,L }, (2)\nzl = MLP(LN(z′\nl)) +z′\nl, l ∈{1,...,L }, (3)\nwhere Lis the total number of layers in the Transformer. The classiﬁcation token in zL will be fed\ninto a LN layer followed by a fully-connected layer for the ﬁnal prediction. For simplicity, here we\nomit the details on the position embedding, which is unrelated to our main idea. No modiﬁcation is\nperformed on it in addition to the conﬁgurations of backbones.\nFeature reuse. All the Transformers in DVT share the same goal of extracting discriminative\nrepresentations for accurate recognition. Therefore, it is straightforward that downstream models\nshould be learned on the basis of previously obtained deep features, rather than extracting features\nfrom scratch. The former is more efﬁcient since the computation performed in an upstream model\ncontributes to both itself and the successive models. To implement this idea, we propose a feature\nreuse mechanism (see: Figure 3). In speciﬁc, we leverage the image tokens output by the ﬁnal layer\nof the upstream Transformer, i.e., zup\nL, to learn a layer-wise embedding El for the downstream model:\nEl = fl(zup\nL) ∈RN×D′\n. (4)\nHerein, fl: RN×D→RN×D′\nconsists of a sequence of operations starting with a LN-MLP (RD→RD′\n),\nwhich introduces nonlinearity and allows more ﬂexible transformations. Then the image tokens are\nreshaped to the corresponding locations in the original image, upsampled and ﬂattened to match the\ntoken number of the downstream model. Typically, we use a small D′for an efﬁcient fl.\nConsequently, the embedding El is injected into the downstream model, providing prior knowledge\non recognizing the input image. Formally, we replace Eq. (3) by:\nzl = MLP(LN(Concat(z′\nl,El))) +z′\nl, l ∈{1,...,L }, (5)\nwhere El is concatenated with the intermediate tokens z′\nl. We simply increase the dimension of LN\nand the ﬁrst layer of MLP from Dto D+D′. Since El is based on the upstream outputs zup\nL that have\nless tokens than z′\nl, it actually concludes the context information of the input image for each token in\nz′\nl. Therefore, we name El as the context embedding. Besides, we do not reuse the classiﬁcation token\nand pad zero for it in Eq. (5), which we empirically ﬁnd beneﬁcial for the performance. Intuitively,\nEqs.

4: Illustration of the relationship reuse mechanism. We\nleverage the learned self-attention relationships from all upstream\nlayers and attention heads, i.e., Aup, to reﬁne the downstream\nattention maps. The addition operation of logits is adopted. Note\nthat NH denotes the head number for multi-head self-attention.\nRelationship reuse. A promi-\nnent advantage of vision Trans-\nformers is that their self-attention\nblocks enable integrating infor-\nmation across the entire im-\nage, which effectively models\nthe long-range dependencies in\nthe data. Typically, the models\nneed to learn a group of atten-\ntion maps at each layer to de-\nscribe the relationships among to-\nkens. Apart from the deep fea-\ntures mentioned above, the down-\nstream models also have access to\nthe self-attention maps produced\nin previous models. We argue\nthat these learned relationships\nare also capable of being reused\nto facilitate the learning of down-\nstream Transformers.\nGiven the input representation zl, the self-attention is performed as follows. First, the query, key and\nvalue matrices Ql, Kl and Vl are computed via linear projections:\nQl = zlWQ\nl , Kl = zlWK\nl , Vl = zlWV\nl , (6)\nwhere WQ\nl , WK\nl and WV\nl are weight matrices. Then the attention map is calculated by a scaled\ndot-product operation with softmax to aggregate the values of all tokens, namely\nAttention(zl) =Softmax(Al)Vl, Al = QlKl\n⊤/\n√\nd. (7)\nHere d is the hidden dimension of Q or K, and Al ∈RN×N denotes the logits of the attention\nmap. Note that we omit the details on the multi-head attention mechanism for clarity, where Al may\ninclude multiple attention maps. Such a simpliﬁcation does not affect the description of our method.\nFor relationship reuse, we ﬁrst concatenate the attention logits produced by all layers of the upstream\nmodel (i.e., Aup\nl ,l ∈{1,...,L }):\nAup = Concat(Aup\n1 ,Aup\n2 ,..., Aup\nL) ∈RNup×Nup×NAtt\nup , (8)\nwhere Nup and NAtt\nup denote the number of tokens and all attention maps in the upstream model,\nrespectively. Typically, we haveNAtt\nup = NHL, where NH is the number of heads for the multi-head\nattention and Lis the number of layers. Then the downstream Transformer learns attention maps by\nleveraging both its own tokens and Aup simultaneously. Formally, we replace Eq. (7) by\nAttention(zl) =Softmax(Al + rl(Aup))Vl, Al = QlKl\n⊤/\n√\nd, (9)\nwhere rl(·) is a transformation network that integrates the information provided by Aup to reﬁne the\ndownstream attention logits Al. The architecture of rl(·) is presented in Figure 4, which includes a\nMLP for nonlinearity followed by an upsample operation to match the size of attention maps. For\nmulti-head attention, the output dimension of the MLP will be set to the number of heads.\nHW\n<latexit

5: An example for the upsam-\nple operation in rl(·).\nNotably, Eq. (9) is a simple but ﬂexible formulation. For one\nthing, each self-attention block in the downstream model has\naccess to all the upstream attention heads in both shallow and\ndeep layers, and hence can be trained to leverage multi-level\nrelationship information on its own basis. For another, as the\nnewly generated attention maps and the reused relationships\nare combined in logits, their relative importance can be auto-\nmatically learned by adjusting the magnitude of logits. It is\nalso worth noting that the regular upsample operation cannot\nbe directly applied in rl(·). To illustrate this issue, we take\nupsampling a HW×HW (H=W=2) attention map to H′W′×H′W′(H′=W′=3) for example\nin Figure 5. Since each of its rows and columns corresponds to H×W image tokens, we reshape the\nrows or columns back to H×W, scale them to H′×W′, and then ﬂatten them to H′W′vectors.\n6\n3.3 Adaptive Inference\nAs aforementioned, the proposed DVT framework progressively increases the number of tokens for\neach test sample and performs early-termination, such that “easy” and “hard” images can be processed\nusing varying tokens with uneven computational cost, improving the overall efﬁciency. Speciﬁcally,\nat the ith exit that produces the softmax prediction pi, the largest entry of pi, i.e., maxjpij (deﬁned\nas conﬁdence [23, 52, 47]), is compared with a threshold ηi. If maxjpij ≥ηi, the inference will stop\nby adopting pi as the output. Otherwise, the image will be represented using more tokens to activate\nthe downstream Transformer. We always adopt a zero-threshold for the ﬁnal Transformer.\nThe values of {η1,η2,... }are solved on the validation set. We assume abudgeted batch classiﬁcation\n[23] setting, where DVT needs to recognize a set of samples Dval within a given computational\nbudget B >0. Let Acc(Dval,{η1,η2,... }) and FLOPs(Dval,{η1,η2,... }) denote the accuracy and\ncomputational cost on Dval when using the thresholds {η1,η2,... }. The optimal thresholds can be\nobtained by solving the following optimization problem:\nmaximize\nη1,η2,...\nAcc(Dval,{η1,η2,... }) subject to FLOPs (Dval,{η1,η2,... }) ≤B. (10)\nDue to the non-differentiability, we solve this problem with the genetic algorithm [48] in this paper.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we empirically validate the proposed DVT on ImageNet [ 9] and CIFAR-10/100\n[26]. Ablation studies and visualization are presented on ImageNet to give a deeper understanding\nof our method. Code and pre-trained models based on PyTorch are available athttps://github.\ncom/blackfeather-wang/Dynamic-Vision-Transformer . We also provide the implementa-\ntion using the MindSpore framework and the models trained on a cluster of Ascend AI processors at\nhttps://github.com/blackfeather-wang/Dynamic-Vision-Transformer-MindSpore .\nDatasets. (1) ImageNet is a 1,000-class dataset from ILSVRC2012 [9], containing 1.2 million images\nfor training and 50,000 images for validation. (2) CIFAR-10/100 datasets [26] contain 32x32 colored\nimages in 10/100 classes. Both of them consist of 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images\nfor testing. For all the three datasets, we adopt the same data pre-processing and data augmentation\npolicy as [19, 24, 23]. In addition, we solve the conﬁdence thresholds stated in Section 3.3 on the\ntraining set, which we ﬁnd achieves similar performance to adopting cross-validation.\nBackbones. Our experiments are based on several state-of-the-art vision Transformers, namely\nT2T-ViT-12 [55], T2T-ViT-14 [55], and DeiT-small (w/o distillation) [38]. Unless otherwise speciﬁed,\nwe deploy DVT with three exits, corresponding to representing the images as 7x7, 10x10 and 14x14\ntokens3. For fair comparisons, our implementation exploits the ofﬁcial code of the backbones, and\nadopts exactly the same training hyper-parameters. More training details can be found in Appendix\nA. The number of FLOPs is calculated using the fvcore toolkit provided by Facebook AI Research,\nwhich is also used in Detectron2 [50], PySlowFast [13], and ClassyVision [1].\nImplementation details. For feature reuse, the hidden size and output size of the MLP in fl(·) are\nset to 128 and 48. In relationship reuse, for implementation efﬁciency, we share the same hidden\nstate across the MLPs of all rl(·), such that rl(Aup),l ∈{1,...,L }can be obtained at one time in\nconcatenation by implementing a single large MLP, whose hidden size and output size are3NHLand\nNHL. Note that NH is the head number of multi-head attention and Lis the layer number.\n4.1 Main Results\nResults on ImageNet are shown in Figures 6 and 7, where T2T-ViT [ 55] and DeiT [ 38] are im-\nplemented as backbones respectively. As stated in Section 3.3, we vary the average computational\nbudget, solve the conﬁdence thresholds, and evaluate the corresponding validation accuracy. The\nperformance of DVT is plotted in gray curves, with the best accuracy under each budget plotted in\nblack curves. We also compare our method with several highly competitive baselines, i.e., TNT [17],\nLocalViT [28], CrossViT [5], PVT [44], ViT [11] and ResNet [19]. It can be observed that DVT\nconsistently reduces the computational cost of the backbones. For example, DVT achieves the 82.3%\naccuracy with 3.6x less FLOPs compared with the vanilla T2T-ViT. When the budget ranges among\n0.5-2 GFLOPs, DVT has ∼1.7-1.9x less computation than T2T-ViT with the same performance.\nNotably, our method can ﬂexibly attain all the points on each curve by simply adjusting the values of\nconﬁdence thresholds with a single DVT.\n3Although 4x4 tokens are also used as an example in Section 1, we ﬁnd starting with 7x7 is more efﬁcient.\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nGFLOPs/image\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83accuracy (%)\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\nGFLOPs/image\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83\n84accuracy (%)\nDVT\nT2T-ViT\nTNT\nLocalViT\nCrossViT\nPVT\nResNet\nViT\n1.6x\n1.7x\n1.7x\n1.9x\n3.6x\nFigure 6: Top-1 accuracy v.s.

We test the actual speed of DVT on a NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU under a\nbatch inference setting, where a mini-batch of data is fed into the model at a time. After inferring each\nTransformer, the samples that meet the early-termination criterion will exit, with the remaining images\nfed into the downstream Transformer. The results are presented in Table 2. Here we adopt a two-exit\nDVT based on T2T-ViT-12 using 7x7 and 14x14 tokens, which we ﬁnd more efﬁcient in practice. All\nother implementation details remain unchanged. One can observe that DVT improves the accuracy of\nsmall models (T2T-ViT-7/10/12) by 3.7-6.8% with the same inference speed, while accelerates the\ninference of the large T2T-ViT-14/19 models by 1.4-1.7x without sacriﬁcing performance.\nResults on CIFAR are presented in Table 3. Following the common practice [ 11, 55, 17, 38], we\nresize the CIFAR images to 224x224, and ﬁne-tune the T2T-ViT and DVT models in Figure 6. The\nofﬁcial code and training conﬁgurations provided by [55] are utilized. We report the computational\ncost of DVT when it achieves the competitive performance with baselines. Our proposed method is\nshown to consume ∼3-9x less computation compared with T2T-ViT.\nTable 4: Comparisons between DVT and three state-of-the-art methods for improving the compu-\ntational efﬁciency of vision Transformers, i.e., Data distillation [38], DynamicViT [32] and Patch\nslimming [36]. Both DVT and the baselines are implemented on top of DeiT-small. Since the\ncomputational cost of DVT can be adjusted online, we match the FLOPs or the accuracy of DVT\nwith the baselines, respectively, to see the difference.\nDeiT-smallData distillation DVT DynamicViT DVT Patch slimming DVT\nTop-1 Acc. 79.80% 81.20% 81.20% 81.67% 79.30% 79.30% 80.40% 79.40% 79.40% 79.81%\nGFLOPs/image 4.61 4.63 3.61 4.63 2.90 2.37 2.90 2.60 2.41 2.60\nComparisons with SOTA baselines. In Table 4, we compare DVT with several recently proposed\napproaches for facilitating efﬁcient vision Transformers on ImageNet. Both knowledge distillation\n(KD) [38] and patch pruning based methods [ 32, 36] are considered. One can observe that DVT\noutperforms the baselines with similar FLOPs, or has signiﬁcantly lower computational cost with the\nsame accuracy. Besides, one can expect that DVT is compatible with these techniques, i.e., DVT can\nalso be trained with KD to further boost the accuracy or leverage patch pruning to reduce the FLOPs.\n8\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\nGFLOPs/image\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83accuracy (%) DVT\nDeiT\nResNet\nViT\n1.7x\n3.2x\nFigure 7: Performance of DeiT-based DVT on\nImageNet.

We conduct exper-\niments by ablating one or both of\nthe reuse mechanisms. For a clear\ncomparison, we ﬁrst deactivate the\nearly-termination, and report the\naccuracy and GFLOPs correspond-\ning to each exit in Table 6. The\nthree-exit DVT based on T2T-ViT-\n12 is considered. One can observe that both the two reuse mechanisms are able to signiﬁcantly boost\nthe accuracy of DVT at the 2 nd and 3rd exits with at most 6% additional computation, while they\nare compatible with each other to further improve the performance. We also ﬁnd that involving\ncomputation reusing slightly hurts the accuracy at the 1st exit, which may be attributed to the compro-\nmise made by the ﬁrst Transformer for downstream models. However, once the early-termination is\nadopted, this difference only results in trivial disadvantage when the computational budget is very\nsmall, as shown in Figure 8. DVT outperforms the baseline signiﬁcantly in most cases.\nDesign choices for the reuse mechanisms. Here we study the design of the feature and relationship\nreuse mechanisms. For experimental efﬁciency, we consider a two-exit DVT based on T2T-ViT-12\nusing 7x7 and 10x10 tokens, while enlarge the batch size and the initial learning rate by 4 times. Such\na training setting slightly degrades the accuracy of DVT, but it is still reliable to reﬂect the difference\nbetween different design variants. We deactivate early-termination, and report the performance of\neach exit. Notably, as the FLOPs of 1st exit remain unchanged (i.e., 0.47G), we do not present it.\nWe consider four variants of feature reuse in Table 7: (1) reusing features from the corresponding\nupstream layer instead of the ﬁnal layer; (2) reusing classiﬁcation token; (3) only performing feature\nreuse in the ﬁrst layer of the downstream model; (4) removing the LN infl(·). One can see that taking\nﬁnal tokens of the upstream model and reusing them in each downstream layer are both important.\nAblation results for relationship reuse are presented in Table 8. We consider four variants as well:\n(1) only reusing the attention logits from the corresponding upstream layer; (2) only reusing the\nattention logits from the ﬁnal upstream layer; (3) replacing the MLP by a linear layer in rl(·); (4)\nadopting naive upsample operation instead of what is shown in Figure 5; The results indicate that it is\nbeneﬁcial to enable each downstream layer to ﬂexibly reuse all upstream attention logits. Besides,\nnaive upsampling signiﬁcantly hurts the performance.\n9\nTable 7: Ablation studies for feature reuse.\nAblation 1st Exit (7x7) 2nd Exit (10x10)\nTop-1 Acc. Top-1 Acc.

Two classi-\nﬁers are uniformly added to the in-\ntermediate layers of T2T-ViT-14,\nand the early-exiting is performed\nwith the three exits in the same way as DVT. One can observe that the layer-adaptive T2T-ViT\nachieves signiﬁcantly lower accuracy than DVT using identical computational budgets. This inferior\nperformance may be alleviated by improving the network architecture, as shown in [23].\n4.3 Visualization\nFigure 9 shows the images that are ﬁrst correctly classiﬁed at the 1st and 3rd exits of the DVT (T2T-\nViT-12). The former are recognized as “easy” samples, while the later are considered to be “hard”.\nOne can observe that “easy” samples usually depict the recognition objectives in clear and canonical\nposes and sufﬁciently large resolution. On the contrary, “hard” samples may contain complex scenes\nand non-typical poses or only include a small part of the objects, and require a ﬁner representation\nusing more tokens. Figure 10 presents the numbers of images that exit at different exits when the\ncomputational budget increases. The plot shows that the accuracy of DVT is signiﬁcantly improved\nwith more images exiting later, which is achieved by changing the conﬁdence thresholds online.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we sought to optimally conﬁgure a proper number of tokens for each individual image\nin vision Transformers, and hence proposed the Dynamic Vision Transformer (DVT) framework.\nDVT processes each test input by sequentially activating a cascade of Transformers using increasing\nnumbers of tokens, until an appropriate token number is reached (measured by the prediction\nconﬁdence). We further introduce the feature and relationship reuse mechanisms to facilitate efﬁcient\ncomputation reuse. Extensive experiments indicate that DVT signiﬁcantly improves the computational\nefﬁciency on top of state-of-the-art vision Transformers, both theoretically and empirically.\n10\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported in part by the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry\nof Science and Technology of China under Grants 2018AAA0100701, the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China under Grants 61906106 and 62022048, and Huawei Technologies Ltd.

The training of DVT\nfollows exactly the same conﬁgurations as the backbones, which are also recommended by their\nofﬁcial implementations. The details on optimizer, learning rate schedule, batch size and other\nhyper-parameters can be easily found in their papers or code. Note that a number of regularization\nand data augmentation techniques are exploited, including RandAugment [7], Random Erasing [61],\nLabel Smoothing [34], Mixup [58], Cutmix [56], and stochastic depth [25]. We train all the models\nwith 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.\nTable 11: Effects when the location for performing feature reuse varies.\nAblation 1st Exit (7x7) 2 nd Exit (10x10)\nTop-1 Acc. Top-1 Acc.

To shed light on the layer-wise reuse\nparadigm in the downstream model, we test performing feature or relationship reuse only in the\nshallow/deep half of downstream layers. The same experimental protocol as ablating the design of\nreuse mechanisms is adopted. The results are shown in Tables 11 and 12. Obviously, it is more\nimportant to reuse upstream features/relationships at the shallow layers. This phenomenon indicates\nthat the main effects of the proposed reuse mechanisms lie in helping the ﬁrst several transformer\nlayers to rapidly extract discriminative representations or to learn accurate attention maps. The\nsuccessive layers focus more on further improving the shallow features, while less on leveraging\nupstream information, which may have been effectively integrated into the shallow layers.\nWhich upstream layers contribute more to relationship reuse? In Table 13, we further test only\ntaking the attention logits from the shallow/deep half of upstream layers in relationship reuse. One\ncan observe that both shallow and deep relationships are important for boosting the accuracy of the\n4https://github.com/yitu-opensource/T2T-ViT\n5https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit\n15\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\naverage budget (in MUL-ADD)\n96.60\n96.85\n97.10\n97.35\n97.60\n97.85\n98.10\n98.35\n98.60\naccuracy (%)\nDVT\nT2T-ViT\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\naverage budget (in MUL-ADD)\n96.5\n97.0\n97.5\n98.0\n98.5\n99.0\naccuracy (%)\nDVT\nT2T-ViT\nFigure 11: Top-1 accuracy v.s.
