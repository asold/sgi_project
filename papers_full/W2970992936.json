Introduction\nIn recent years, DC distribution systems have been actively\nstudied to save the power consumption of data-centers or\nlarge buildings (1) (2). The DC distribution systems have a ca-\npability of downsizing and eﬃcient conversion in comparison\nwith an AC distribution system because the number of power\nconversion will be decreased\n(3). I ns u c haD Cd i s t r i b u t i o n\nsystem, a 6.6-kV AC grid is employed as one of the power\nsources.\nA transformer is employed for the DC distribution system\nwith the AC power grid for achieving the step-down from\n6.6 kV to the distribution voltage of several hundred volts.\nThe transformer plays a role as galvanic isolation between\nthe DC distribution system and the AC power grid\n(4) (5).G e n -\nerally, the conventional transformer which is used at the grid\nfrequency, e.g., 60 Hz or 50 Hz is bulky and heavy.\nAs one of the solutions to downsizing the isolation stage,\na transformer-less PWM converter is proposed\n(6). The high\nvoltage IGBTs with the voltage rating more than 4.5 kV are\nrequired in a ﬁve-level diode-clamped converter. The ﬁve-\nlevel diode-clamped converter requires the balancing circuit\nas the auxiliary circuit in order to balance the capacitor volt-\nage in the DC link. Besides, the ﬁve-level diode-clamped\nconverter is operated with a low switching frequency because\nthe loss of high voltage rating devices is large compared to\na) Correspondence to: Jun-ichi Itoh.

The operation in low-switching\nfrequency results in large passive components because har-\nmonic distortion of input current and voltage ripple of output\nDC voltage should be suppressed.\nAs another solution, solid-state transformers (SST) have\nmuch attention\n(7)–(9). SSTs achieve signiﬁcant volume reduc-\ntion of the converter in comparison with the low-frequency\ntransformer by high-frequency switching using the character-\nistics of wide-bandgap semiconductors, e.g., silicon carbide\n(SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) devices\n(10). Moreover, the\nuse of high-frequency transformer for isolation and the step-\ndown function provides the advantage to the SST in terms of\nthe downsizing. SST has the following advantages in conse-\nquence\n(11):\n•AC voltage adjustment\n•DC voltage output\n•Reduction in size and weight of the system\n•Active and reactive power control\n•Low harmonics components in AC side\nFurthermore, the converters with cells based on multi-\nlevel topologies have advantages because it enables to reduce\nthe required voltage rating of the switching devices. Thus,\nthe switching devices with low on-state resistance and high-\nspeed switching can be used. In addition, the switching fre-\nquency is equivalently increased by the multilevel topology.\nThus, the size of the inductors in the converter can also be\nreduced\n(12).\nOne of the problems of the multilevel topology is the num-\nber of switches. The number of switches greatly increases\nowing to the multiple cells.

Circuit conﬁguration of propos ed bidirectional single-phase SST\nof the gate signal will be increased with an increased number\nof the switch(13). Moreover, a balance control for each capaci-\ntor on the cells must be employed in the multilevel converters\nsuch as a modular multilevel converter (MMC)\n(14). The bal-\nance control may cause an unstable if a feedback control has a\ndelay due to isolation or signal transmission\n(15).F u r t h e r m o r e ,\nthe DC link capacitor with a large capacitance is required to\nmaintain the capacitor voltage on each cell (16).\nThis paper proposes a simple circuit conﬁguration of the\nsingle-phase SST. The proposed SST has the automatic volt-\nage balancing capability without a complex voltage balance\ncontrol with a small primary side capacitor. In the proposed\nSST, the number of devices is smaller than the conventional\nSST because a single-phase rectiﬁer is employed for all of the\ncells. Moreover, the eﬀect of reducing the number of devices\nincreases according to the number of cells. The originality of\nthis paper is proposing the new topology of the SST, which\nhas an automatic voltage balancing capability using an open-\nloop controlled resonant DC-DC converter. By connecting\nthe resonant DC-DC converter with an open-loop control in\nparallel on the secondary side, the DC-link voltage on each\ncell is automatically balanced. Thus, a small capacitor on the\nprimary side in comparison with the conventional SST is used\nbecause the proposed circuit decouples a power pulsation at\ntwice the grid frequency in the secondary side. The proposed\nSST in this paper makes the control simple. The proposed\nSST has been tested with a unidirectional miniature model\nwith the input voltage of 200 V . The fundamental operation\nhad been demonstrated in (17) by authors. In this paper, the\nproposed SST is experimentally tested under a derated volt-\nage of 1320 V , which is 1/5 of the full model. Moreover, the\nbidirectional operation is demonstrated in this paper. Addi-\ntionally, the equations for a calculation of the power loss is\nderived for separating the power loss of the proposed SST.\nThe validity of the equations is conﬁrmed with the experi-\nmental result with the prototype. Then, the proposed SST is\ndesigned for a 6.6-kV grid as the input voltage.\n2. The System Conﬁguration of Proposed SST\n2.1 Circuit Conﬁguration Figure 1 shows the cir-\ncuit conﬁguration of the proposed SST. At the primary side,\nthe full-bridge rectiﬁer with switches with the high-voltage\nrating is connected. These switches are switched at the grid\nTable 1. Comparison of switching device between con-\nventional SST and proposed SST\nfrequency, so the high-voltage switched can be used even if\nthe switching speed of the high-voltage switches is slow. The\ncharacteristic of the proposed topology is the SST has the\nfull-bridge rectiﬁer in the input stage. The power factor cor-\nrection (PFC) is ensured by the full-bridge rectiﬁer and each\nchopper cell connected in series. The PFC circuit controls the\ninput current to the sinusoidal waveform with the unity power\nfactor. For this reason, the voltage per cell is reduced. Con-\nsequently, it is possible to apply the switching device with a\nlow voltage rating and low on-state resistance on the primary\nside. In each cell, the resonant DC/DC converter is employed.\nThe resonant DC-DC converter is operated in high-frequency\nfor the downsizing the transformer. Moreover, the duty ratio\nof the resonant DC-DC converter is operated in ﬁxed duty.\nThus, the switching loss is small by the zero-current switch-\ning.\nIn general SST topology, a large capacitor should be used\nin the primary side as the DC-ling capacitor to smooth the\nDC-link voltage. By contrast, small capacitors are used be-\ncause the proposed circuit decouples a power pulsation at\ntwice the grid frequency in the secondary side in this system.\nTable 1 shows the comparison of the number of switches\nbetween the conventional SST, which includes a PWM rec-\ntiﬁer and a dual active bridge converter\n(18) and the proposed\nSST and. Note that the number of cells is calculated from\neach rated voltage of the switches with considering the volt-\nage margin. As shown in Table 1, the number of devices\nis reduced by 30% in comparison with the conventional SST\nbecause the proposed SST save the number of switched using\none rectiﬁer on the primary side. Consequently, the proposed\ncircuit increases the utilization rate of the circuit compared to\nthe MMC.\n2.2 Control System Figure 2 shows the control block\ndiagram of the proposed SST. The control block diagram has\n796 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.5, 2019\nSST with Automatic Capacitor V oltage Balance CapabilityʢJun-ichi Itoh et al.ʣ\nFig. 2. Control block of PFC converter in proposed circuit\nan automatic current regulator (ACR) for the current control\nof the boost inductor. The ACR controls the inductor current\ninto full wave rectiﬁed waveform synchronized with the rec-\ntiﬁed input voltage to achieve a PFC operation. The inductor\ncurrent command I\nL∗is given by\nI∗\nL =Iamp |sin(ωt)|······························· (1)\nwhere Iamp is the amplitude command value of the boost in-\nductor current. The inductor current command IL∗ is gener-\nated by the multiplication of Iamp and the full-wave rectiﬁed\nwaveform in phase to the input voltage.\nThe gate signal for PFC is generated by phase shifted car-\nriers of a triangular wave. Thus, the input voltage is equally\ndivided because the switching timing is diﬀerent. In addition,\nlow voltage switches can be used. Note that the ripple cur-\nrent is reduced because the inductor voltage is reduced by the\nseries connection in the PFC converter. Then, the phase shift\nangle θis given by\nθ=2k\nm π (k =0,1,···,m −1)·················· (2)\nMeanwhile, the proposed topology does not need the bal-\nance control of the capacitor on the primary side Vdc1.T h e\nvoltage of the primary side capacitor may be imbalanced ow-\ning to a di ﬀerence of transient response or variation of ca-\npacitances in general multilevel topology. However, DC-link\nvoltage of each cell is automatically balanced because the\nresonant DC-DC converters, which is operated with the con-\nstant duties are connected in parallel on the secondary side.\nConsequently, the capacitor voltage on the primary side is\nnaturally clamped by the voltage, which is determined by the\nturn ratio and the secondary voltage because the cell with\nhigh DC-link voltage will supply much power than the cell\nwith low voltage. Thus, capacitor voltage management on\nthe high-voltage side is not required.\nFigure 3 shows the switching pulse generation of the pri-\nmary side rectiﬁer. The switching pulse is generated by com-\nparing the input voltage v\nin and the thresholds voltage of pos-\nitive/negative (Vthp /Vthn). The switching states are the fol-\nlowing:\n•vin >Vthp\nSwitches S1 and S4 are a turn-on\nSwitches S2 and S3 are a turn-oﬀ\n•vin <Vthn\nSwitches S2 and S3 are a turn-on\nSwitches S1 and S4 are a turn-oﬀ\n•Vthn <vin <Vthp\nFig. 3. Pulse generation for primary side rectiﬁer\nTable 2.

In contrast, the current ﬂows\nto the snubber circuit during the regeneration mode.\nTable 2 shows the switching state of the rectiﬁer on the pri-\nmary side, the resonant DC-DC converter, and the rectiﬁer\non the secondary side. In the rectiﬁer on the primary side,\nthe switching frequency is the same as the grid frequency in\norder to achieve the polarity inversion. In the resonant DC-\nDC converter, the switching frequency is set to the resonant\nfrequency for the ZCS operation, and the switches are mod-\nulated with a duty ratio of 50%. Hence, the resonant DC-DC\nconverter is operated with the open-loop control with con-\nstant duty. Thus, the control is simple in this system because\nthe current control is achieved by only the switches of PFC\n(S\npfc ). In the rectiﬁer on the secondary side uses the synchro-\nnized switching pulse with the resonant DC-DC converter.\n3. Design of Proposed SST\n3.1 Snubber Circuit A snubber circuit is used for\nboth the powering operation and the regeneration operation\nin the proposed SST. During the regeneration operation, the\ncontinuous current ﬂow is ensured by the snubber circuit. In\nother words, the boost inductor current commutates into the\nsnubber circuit during the dead time. The snubber circuit\nhas to absorb all energy stored in the boost inductor when all\nof the switches are a turn-o ﬀwith an over-current detection.\n797 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.5, 2019\nSST with Automatic Capacitor V oltage Balance CapabilityʢJun-ichi Itoh et al.ʣ\nThus, the capacitor of the snubber circuit should be larger as\nexpressed by\nCsnb ≥LbI2\nmax\nΔV2 ··································· (3)\nwhere ΔV is the voltage rise of the capacitor, and Imax is cur-\nrent at an over-current detection. The resistor of the snubber\ncircuit is given by\nR\nsnb ≤ 2Vclamp 2\nLbI2max fsw\n rec\n····························· (4)\nwhere Vclamp is the clamp voltage, f se\n rec is the switching fre-\nquency of the rectiﬁer on the primary side. The clamp voltage\nis designed to have a margin concerning the rated voltage of\nthe device. In the miniature model SST, the margin is 20%.\n3.2 Power-factor-correction (PFC) Converter The\nboost converter on each cell is used for the PFC operation.\nThe boost inductor current is controlled into full-wave recti-\nﬁed waveform as same as general PFC circuit\n(19) (20). The boost\ninductor Lb in the PFC circuit is given by\nLb =\n√\n2Vin\n4 feqΔILb\n·································· (5)\nwhere f eq is the equivalent switching frequency of the out-\nput voltage Veq,a n dΔILb is the ripple current of the inductor\ncurrent, and. Then, the equivalent switching frequency f eq is\ngiven by\nfeq =m ×fsw ··································· (6)\nwhere f sw is the switching frequency of the PFC circuit, m is\nthe number of cells. Each cell is modulated with the phase-\nshifted carrier each other. Consequently, the switching fre-\nquency component in V\neq is increased in proportional to the\nnumber of cells. Thus, the size of the boost inductor is re-\nduced because the inductance is inversely proportional to fre-\nquency.\n3.3 Resonant DC-DC Converter The galvanic iso-\nlation is ensured by the resonant DC-DC converter (21).T h e\nhigh-frequency operation contributes to the minimization\nof the isolation transformer. In addition, the zero-current\nswitching (ZCS) is achieved by the series resonance between\nthe inductor L\ns and the capacitor Cs. ZCS greatly reduce the\nswitching loss of the proposed SST system.\nFurthermore, the leakage inductance is designed to be neg-\nligibly smaller than the excitation inductance. Then, the\nswitching frequency f\no of the resonant DC-DC converter is\ngiven by (7). From resonance frequency, the duty ratio of the\nswitch is 50%.\nf\no = 1\n2π√\nLsCs\n·································· (7)\nIn the proposed SST, the operation mode is always the\nboost operation with respect to the primary side voltage.\nThus, the turn ratio of the transformer is designed by (8).\nN =N1\nN2\n≥\n√\n2Vin\n2 mλVout\n····························· (8)\nwhere Vin is the input voltage, Vout is the output voltage, N1\nand N2 are the numbers of turns for the primary /secondary\nside of the high-frequency transformer, and λis the modula-\ntion index of the boost converter.\nTable 3. Circuit parameter of proposed SST for the\nminiature model\nFig. 4. Operation waveform at power running\n4. Experimental Results\n4.1 Power Running Operation Table 3 shows the\nspeciﬁcations and the circuit parameters. In this experiment,\nthe fundamental operation is tested with the prototype, which\nhas three cells. The input voltage of the prototype is derated\nto 1320 V which is 1/5 of the full model.\nFigure 4 shows the waveforms of the input voltage, the\ninput current, and the output voltage. The operation of the\nminiature model is conﬁrmed. The input power factor of the\nproposed SST is unity. The input current THD is 4.3% at\nthe rated load. At the output side, the step-down operation is\nachieved because the output voltage is regulated to 320 V .\nFigure 5 shows voltage changes of the primary DC-link ca-\npacitors in each cell when the output power is changed from\n0.8 p.u. to 1.0 p.u. Note that the rated power is 1.0 p.u. =\n2 kW. The primary capacitor voltage is balanced in both the\nsteady state and transient state. Moreover, the maximum DC-\nlink capacitor voltage on the primary side is almost matched.\nThus, it is conﬁrmed that the DC-link capacitor voltage on the\nprimary side is automatically balanced among all cells with-\nout the balancing control despite the output power changes.\nFigure 6 shows the input voltage of all cells. From\nFig. 6(a), the input voltage is equally divided into each cell\nbecause the output voltage of all cells forms a balanced\n798 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.5, 2019\nSST with Automatic Capacitor V oltage Balance CapabilityʢJun-ichi Itoh et al.ʣ\n(a) Whole ﬁgure (b) Enlarged ﬁgure\nFig. 6.

In Fig. 6(b), it is also conﬁrmed that\nthe equivalent switching frequency f eq is 30 kHz. The equiv-\nalent switching frequency is determined by the switching fre-\nquency in PFC and the number of the cells.\nFigure 7 shows the eﬃciency and input power factor char-\nacteristic. The maximum e ﬃciency is 89.5% at the rated\npower. The input power factor is over 0.95 with the output\npower from 0.5 p.u. to 1.0 p.u.\nFigure 8 shows the input current THD characteristic with\nchanging the output power of the SST. Input current THD is\nrelatively high in the low-power region. This is because the\nrate of the low-order harmonics component appears remark-\nably with respect to the fundamental component because the\ninput current is low when the output power is low.\n4.2 Bidirectional Operation The miniature model is\ntested to conﬁrm the fundamental operation with the input\nvoltage of 200 V because of the limitation of the experimental\nFig. 8. Characteristic of input current THD\nfacilities in this experiment. The regenerative power supply\nis used for the output side for the test of the regeneration.\nFigure 9 shows the bidirectional operation of the proposed\nSST when the operation mode is switched from the power\nrunning to regeneration at the center of the horizontal axis.\nIt is conﬁrmed that the unity power factor on the input side\nis achieved in both the power running and regeneration oper-\nation. The input current THD is 4.2% during the operation.\nFrom the waveforms of the sum of the output voltage of each\ncell, it is conﬁrmed that the waveform is four-level staircase\nvoltage. Note that an equivalent switching frequency f\neq is\n30 kHz. Thereby, the stable operation of the miniature model\nwithout any large distortion is achieved even when the oper-\nation abruptly changes.\nFigure 10 shows the DC-link capacitor voltage on the pri-\nmary side of three cells in the bidirectional operation. Despite\nthe change of the power ﬂow, the DC-link capacitor voltage\non the primary side is balanced among all cells without the\nbalance control even when the operation rapidly changes.\n5. Loss Analysis and Estimation for Full Model\nThe loss of SST is separated based on the components\nshown as follows:\n(i) Diode bridge rectiﬁer on the primary side\n(ii) Switches of PFC converter\n(iii) Switches of the resonant DC-DC converter\n(iv) Rectiﬁer on the secondary side\nTable 4 shows the switching devices for each part. In the\nproposed SST, the rated voltage of 3.3 kV is used in the pri-\nmary side rectiﬁer.\nFirst, the primary DC-link capacitors are selected for the\n799 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.5, 2019\nSST with Automatic Capacitor V oltage Balance CapabilityʢJun-ichi Itoh et al.ʣ\nFig. 9. Bidirectional operation of proposed circuit\nFig. 10. Primary side capacitor voltage of each cell at\nbidirectional operation\nfull model. The current which ﬂows into the electrolytic ca-\npacitor includes not only the power ripple component but also\nthe switching frequency component from the inverter. Thus,\nit is very impossible to analytically derive the ripple current\non the DC-link capacitor. Thus, the capacitor ripple current\nis evaluated by the simulation\n(22). The capacitor ripple cur-\nrent is the function of the output power factor angleϕand the\nmodulation index λ, which is a nonlinear value. Then, the\neﬀective value of the capacitor ripple current is given by (9).\nIrms\n cap =Kcap (ϕ,λ)Iout ·························· (9)\nwhere Iout is the average value of the output current, andKcap\nis the coeﬃcient which is obtained by the simulation.\nFigure 11 shows the simulation result of Kcap . The modu-\nlation index, which expresses the ratio of the voltage per cell\nand the dc-link voltage, is 0.94 in the miniature model SST.\nTable 4. Switching devices for bidirectional operation\nFig. 11. Current coe ﬃcient of output capacitor\nTherefore, from Fig. 11, Kcap (1.0, 0.94) is 0.83.\n5.1 Primary Side Diode Bridge The loss of\nswitches, which is calculated by the on-voltage of the switch\nand the current through the switch, is given by (10).\nP\ncon = 1\n2π\n∫ π\n0\nvon iswdωt······················· (10)\nwhere von is the on-voltage of the switch, isw is the current\nthrough the switch.

In (11),v0 is deﬁned as zero because the MOS-\nFETs are used in the prototype. Moreover, the phase di ﬀer-\nence between the input voltage and the input current is not\nconsidered because the power factor is always unity.

The optimum core shape, core material, and wind-\ning shape can be selected using Gecko MAGNETICS. From\nthe analysis of Gecko MAGNETICS, EPCOS N95 is the op-\ntimum core to minimized the transformer.\n5.5 Loss Distribution Figure 12 shows the shake-\ndown of the power loss, which is measured by the experi-\nments and calculation. The power loss in the powering and\nregeneration operation are presented. It should be noted that\nthe power loss is normalized with the experimental results as\n100%. The calculation shows a good agreement with the ex-\nperimental results. The error of the power loss between the\ncalculation and the experiment is less than 5%.\nFigure 13 shows the calculation result on the power loss of\nthe full model SST. The power loss is calculated with assum-\ning an input voltage of 6.6 kV and an input power of 10 kV A.\nThen, the number of cells is 15 because the use of 1.2-kV\nswitching devices is assumed. From this calculation, the eﬃ-\nciency of the 10-kV A full mode will reach to a 99% conver-\nsion eﬃciency at the rated power. The dominant power loss\nFig. 12.

In the\nproposed SST, the DC-link capacitor on the primary side is\nautomatically balanced without any voltage balancing con-\ntrol. The power running operation of SST is conﬁrmed with\nthe input voltage of 1320 V which is 1 /5 of the full model\nfrom the experimental results. Moreover, the bidirectional\noperation and switch between the powering and regenerating\noperation is tested. As a result, the sinusoidal waveform of\nthe input current is obtained at the primary side. Further-\nmore, the average DC-link capacitor voltage on the primary\nside is stable and balanced among all cells despite the change\nof power ﬂow.\nFinally, the power loss of each part of the system is calcu-\nlated and compared with the experimental result. As a result,\nthe error of the loss between the experimental result and the\ncalculation is less than 5%. Using the calculation, the e ﬃ-\nciency of the full model of the proposed SST is estimated\nthat it will reach a 99% conversion eﬃciency.\n801 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.5, 2019\nSST with Automatic Capacitor V oltage Balance CapabilityʢJun-ichi Itoh et al.ʣ\nReferences\n( 1 ) T.
