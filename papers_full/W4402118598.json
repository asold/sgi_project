  "abstract": "To address the problems of low accuracy in fault diagnosis of oil-immersed transformers, poor state perception ability and real-time collaboration during diagnosis feedback, a fault diagnosis method for transformers based on the integration of digital twins is proposed. Firstly, fault sample balance is achieved through Iterative Nearest Neighbor Oversampling (INNOS), Secondly, nine-dimensional ratio features are extracted, and the correlation between dissolved gases in oil and fault types is established. Then, sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) is used for feature fusion and dimensionality reduction. Finally, the Aquila Optimizer (AO) is introduced to optimize the parameters of the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), establishing the optimal AO-KELM diagnosis model. The final fault diagnosis accuracy reaches 98.1013%. Combining transformer digital twin models, real-time interaction mapping between physical entities and virtual space is achieved, enabling online diagnosis of transformer faults. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has high diagnostic accuracy and strong stability, providing reference for the intelligent operation and maintenance of transformers.",
