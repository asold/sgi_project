INTRODUCTION \nHE concept of Solid-State Transformer (SST) utilizes a \nhigh/medium frequency transformer applied in a power \nelectronic converter. An increase in the operating frequency \nwill make the volume and power density level superior to the \ntraditional 50/60Hz transformers. Modern advancements in the \nmagnetic material discoveries as well as high frequency \nswitching modules development made it possible to have the \ndesirable highly efficient high-power density SSTs. The new \ntechnologies allow the system to have a high saturation flux \ndensity, low core power loss, and low switching & conducting \nlosses [1]-[3]. Many studies have been projected lately on SST \ndesign and applications [4]-[11]. However, most of these studies \nare based on conventional two-ports transformers. The \nsignificant increase in the number of Distributed Generations \n(DGs) and the significance of microgrid concepts has shaped the \nneed for a single compact element integrating multiple \nrenewable sources. This triggered the idea of a Multi-Port Solid \nState Transformer (MPSST) concept. Few articles and research \nwork have been directed towards this concept [12]-[19]. To get \nrid of using several power electronic converters which utilize \nonly two windings solid state transformers, a multi-port solid \nstate transformer can reduce the overall system volume and \nincrease its efficiency and power density. \nAlthough MPSST has multiple ports, it is still a kind of \nmodified Dual Active Bridge (DAB) topology. As it is well \nknown, leakage inductance is one of the most important \nparameters in these converters. A small leakage inductor value \nincreases the di/dt ratio on the switch current and forces the \nswitch to its limitation. In addition, for the same power level, \ncurrent crest factor will increase, and it will result in an increase \nin system losses [20]. On the other hand, the high value of \nleakage inductance raises other problems especially if an \nexternal inductor is utilized in the system topology. The \nmaximum amount of power that can be transferred to the \nsecondary side of the DAB converter is directly related to the \nleakage inductance. A high leakage inductance value limits the \npower throughput transfer capability.  \nThe leakage inductance value depends basically on the \nwinding placement, core geometry, insulation thickness, and \nhence, coupling coefficient between the windings. In addition, \nsystem requirements such as power density, high efficiency, \nmedium voltage insulation specification, partial discharge, etc. \nwill increase the complexity of the transformer design. For a \nmulti-port transformer system, design of the high frequency \ntransformer and achieving the needed leakage inductance value \nis even more difficult [6]. Incorporation of several renewable \nenergy resources in a single compact system will be a major \ndesign breakthrough for the upcoming smart distribution \nsystems.  \nDevelopment of a Medium V oltage, High \nPower, High Frequency Four-Port Solid State \nTransformer  \nAhmad El Shafei, Member, IEEE, Saban Ozdemir, Senior Member, IEEE, Necmi Altin, Senior \nMember, IEEE, Garry Jean-Pierre, Member, IEEE, and Adel Nasiri, Fellow, IEEE \nT\nManuscript received September 11, 2020; revised December 31, 2020; \naccepted August 10, 2021. date of publication March 25, 2022; date of \ncurrent version March 18, 2022. \nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science \nFoundation under Grant No. 1650470, GRAPES I/UCRC program.  \nA.

The four-port SST could be exploited \nin micro and smart grid applications. This research work aims \nat a rated power of 25kW for each connected port. The different \nports can exemplify different DGs such as photovoltaic system, \nenergy storage, and wind turbine. In this research paper, the first \nport illustrates a 4.16kVAC utility grid, while the other three \nports operate at 500VDC representing an energy storage, \nphotovoltaic, and a regulated passive load system. The goal is \nto demonstrate the operation and functionality of the medium \nvoltage multi-port solid state transformer theory, thus, it will be \nassumed that a 7.4kV DC bus (corresponding to 4.16kVAC) \nand three 500V DC buses (corresponding to the energy storage, \nPV, and load) are available. The passive load port will be \nconnected to a full bridge rectifier, while the other three active \nports will be connective to DAB converters operating at 50kHz \nswitching frequency. Furthermore, the energy storage and \nutility grid ports will be considered as bi-directional ports so \nthat power can either be delivered or absorbed, while the PV \nwill be unidirectional one. Fig. 1 summarizes the four-port SST \nsystem that will be studied in this paper.  \nThere are two major challenges in this system: power flow \ncontrol between the four ports as well as designing, building, and \ntesting of the four-windings 50kHz medium voltage SST. In this \npaper, the focus is being directed towards the latter point, while \nthe control study has been developed and published in [21]. \nTransformer modeling complexity incorporates several \ntradeoffs that should be carefully studied and adjusted for. A \ndetailed analysis has been performed in-order to examine the \ndesired transformer core material/shape/size/volume, windings \nplacement/configuration/ number of turns, insulation level, \nleakage/magnetizing inductances, transformer core & copper \nlosses, efficiency, and power density. The design and modeling \nhave been carried throughout a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) \nsimulation. The SST model functionality is verified by ANSYS \nMaxwell-3D and ANSYS Simplorer co-simulation studies. \nThen, the designed transformer and converter are implemented \nand tested for results validation and proof of the medium voltage \nmulti-port solid state transformer (MV MPSST) concept. \nExperimental results will be shown at the end of this work. \n \nFig. 1: Four-ports medium voltage solid state transformer (MV MPSST) \nII. TRANSFORMER DESIGN PROCEDURE \nIn high frequency transformer design, several tasks & studies \nmust be conducted in parallel. For instance, determination of \nmechanical parameters and material selection is considered a \ncritical design issue. Defining these parameters directly affects \nthe electrical parameters such as leakage inductance, energy \ndensity, and efficiency. \nTABLE I.  \nCore Material Comparison \nMaterial Flux \nDensity\n \n1/Price Frequ-\nency  \nDimension \nAvaliability\n \n1/Loss \nFerrite * *** **** *** **** \nAmorphous *** ** ** ** ** \nSilicon Steel **** **** * **** * \nNanocrysta-\nlline ** * *** ** *** \nA. Core Selection \nThe commonly used transformer core materials are si-steel, \nferrite, nanocrystalline, and amorphous. The MV MPSST \ntransformer must use the optimal material for the 50kHz, \n25kW/port application. A literature review has been performed \nto compare the material characteristics at the systems’ rated \nvoltages, power, and switching frequency levels. A summary of \nthe properties of the core materials is given in Table I. Analyzing \nthe material differences sorted out silicon steel and amorphous \nand focused on ferrite and nanocrystalline cores. Although the \nflux density of the nanocrystalline are high compared to ferrite \ncore, nanocrystalline loses its advantages over ferrite when the \nfrequency increases in terms of core loss. In addition, the ferrite \ncore is an easily available material in terms of size, shape, and \ncommercial availability. Consequently, ferrite 3C94 material \nhas been used for the MV MPSST transformer.  \nShape of the transformer is critical as it affects the leakage \ninductance value, core cross-sectional area, volume, energy \ndensity, and thus, the transformer overall size and compactness. \nDesigning a challenging system as the MV MPSST has two \ncritical constraints to be studied and accommodated for: \navoiding the core saturation and minimizing the leakage \ninductance. The core-shape and shell-type configurations have \nbeen studied on a 330kW 50kHz two-port transformer [4]. \nCompared results between the two shapes proved that the shell-\ntype configuration increases the transformer efficiency and has \nlower leakage inductance than the core-type one. Subsequently, \nthe shell-type has been chosen as the MV MPSST core \nconfiguration. Therefore, the three low voltage windings will \nbe interleaved in the middle leg to maximize the coupling \ncoefficient, and the medium voltage winding will be placed on \ntop of them taking into consideration careful insulation.  \nB. Transfomer Formulation \nMathematical formulations for transformer characterization \nand operation have been derived. A MATLAB optimization \nalgorithm has been developed in-order to choose the transformer \nparameters as a starting point for the modeling phase. Some \nequations used in the design optimization phase are given below. \nThe relation between the product of mechanical dimensions with \npower rating, current density, flux density and frequency is given \nin Eq (1): \n\nEI-SHAFEI et al: DEVELOPMENT OF A MEDIUM VOLTAGE, HIGH POWER, HIGH FREQUENCY FOUR-PORT SOLID  97 \nSTATE TRANSFORMER \n 410P C a\nf cu m\nSA A W K K B fJ   \nwhere J is the current density,  f is the switching frequency, Bm \nis the maximum flux density, Ac is the core cross-sectional area, \nAp is the product area, Wa is the window area, S is the rated \npower, Kf is the waveform coefficient, and Kcu is the window \nutilization factor. \nTransformer equations for induced voltage, core loss, \nwinding loss, maximum flux density and number of turns are \nsummarized below: \n       C\nd t dB tv t N NA v tdt dt\n                   (2)\n Core refP k B f   \n 4\nm\nC\nVB xfxNxA  \n 1 d\nf C m\nTVN K A B f \n    \n \nwhere V denotes the induced voltage, N number of turns, I rated \ncurrent, Pcore core losses, kref, β and α core coefficients extracted \nfrom the material datasheet, α wire coefficient, Psw switching \nlosses, and Td dead-time for switches. \nC. Four-port Transformer Equivalent Circuit Derivation \nIn this section, a systematic approach for calculating the \nleakage and magnetizing inductances and obtaining the \nequivalent circuit of MPSST is presented. This method \ngenerates a model for the given MPSST structure. Then, the \nfour-port MPSST inductance matrix which includes the self \nand mutual inductances is extracted from ANSYS Maxwell-\n3D simulation for this model. Finally, the leakage and \nmagnetizing inductances which define the equivalent circuit \nof the MPSST are calculated by using derived mathematical \nequations and this inductance matrix.  \n \nFig. 2. General MPSST Configuration. \nAs seen from Fig. 2 for a general MPSST configuration, all \nports are magnetically coupled and form self and mutual fluxes \nwhich have effects on power transfer among the interacting \nports. The analysis process is as summarized in the flowchart \ngiven in Fig. 3. \nAs a first step, fluxes equations are written, and induced \nvoltage equations are derived by using Faraday’s law [22], [23]: \n 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 4m\ndv N .dt                      (6) \n \nFig. 3.

Definition of Design Parameters \nFerrite 3C94 core has been used with AWG#8 and AWG#16 \nLitz wire for low voltage and medium voltage windings, \nrespectively. After running a MATLAB optimization code, the \nfollowing analysis was concluded. In Fig. 4, the variations of Bm, \ncore loss (Pc), winding loss (Pw), sum of core and winding losses \n(transformer losses, Ptr), sum of transformer and switching \nlosses (total losses, Pt), and core and copper weight, have been \nplotted and demonstrated with respect to Ac and N. Analyzing \nthe graphs shows that for the LV ports, Ac and N being in the \nrange of 34.08-51.12cm2 and 6-12, respectively, will result in a \nhigh transformer efficiency. However, it was noticed that going \nabove 9 turns will increase the core and copper volumes, and in- \nreturn, causes an increase in the cost and a reduction in the power \ndensity. These results gave a good building block information \n \nFig. 4. Results for theoretical calculations. \nand starting point for the MV MPSST design phase.  \nE. Insulation Requirement \nThe insulation requirement for a dry-type transformer is \nexplained in IEEE Std. C.57.12.01 and IEEE Std. C57.124. The \nBasic Impulse Lightning (BIL) test voltage for this MV MPSST \ntransformer shall be in the range of 30kV. The most important \nlimitation regarding the insulation is the effect of the thickness \nof the insulation materials in the high voltage windings and \ntransformer core. There are two cases here, the first is the need \nto increase the physical dimensions of the transformer, and the \nsecond is that the leakage inductance increases due to the \ndecrease in the coupling coefficient. In-order to ensure proper \ninsulation between windings, 10kV AC polyurethane-nylon \n(MW80-C) has been used as Litz wires insulation jackets. \nMoreover, multi-layer Kapton adhesive taped on Nomex818 \nsheets were inserted as inter-winding insulation layers. These \nsheets reached more than 32kV of insulation level. In addition, \nthe transformer core must be covered with these insulation \nsheets in order to avoid insulation breakdown between the core \nand the medium voltage (MV) terminal cables at 7.4kV \npotential. Finally, and as a rule of thumb, the LV windings are \nwrapped first around the transformer mid-leg, and the MV \ncables at the outer layer to avoid MV/core insulation breakdown. \nF. Extracting Four-port Transformer Parameters \nSeveral models have been simulated with different core sizes \n(34.08-51.12cm2), number of turns (6-9), and winding \narrangements as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. Each design is \nmodelled in ANSYS Maxwell-3D, and then co-simulated with a \npower electronic converter modelled in ANSYS Simplorer. The \ntransformer is tested for different operating conditions with \ndifferent phase-shift angles. It should be noted that ANSYS just \ngives the self and mutual inductance matrix between the four \nports and does not calculate the leakage and magnetizing \ninductance values. Therefore, a systematic and theoretical \nmathematical derivation has been carried out in-order to \ncalculate these inductances values. The MPSST equivalent \ncircuit was derived and the winding arrangements have been \ntaken into consideration in-order to calculate the leakage \ninductance for all the models of Fig. 5.  \nAs a next step, the four-port transformer is modelled and \nsimulated with ANSYS Maxwell-3D to obtain the inductance \nmatrix.  The transformer core is designed with Ferrite MnZn \n3C94 core with a number of turns of: N1-LV  = N2-LV  =N3-LV  = 9 \n\nEI-SHAFEI et al: DEVELOPMENT OF A MEDIUM VOLTAGE, HIGH POWER, HIGH FREQUENCY FOUR-PORT SOLID  99 \nSTATE TRANSFORMER \n \n \nFig. 5.

Then, a MATLAB code is developed in \norder to solve equation (24) in which the leakage and \nmagnetizing inductances are calculated.

SIMULATION RESULTS \nSimulation of the complete system by linking the Maxwell-\n3D model (physics and magnetics of the transformer) along with \nSimplorer circuit (power electronics circuit) will result in a \ncomplete and realistic simulation of the entire MV MPSST \nsystem. After the evaluation of the possible design models for \nthe proposed MV MPPST (Fig. 5), Maxwell-3D/ Simplorer co-\nsimulation studies are carried out (Fig. 8). The ports voltages of \nthe system are 7.4kVDC for MV grid port and 500VDC for \nenergy storage, PV, and load ports. The simulation is carried out \nat 50kHz switching frequency and at full load to deliver 25kW \nto the load port. The duty cycle of the PWM signals are kept \nconstant at 50% and power control is obtained by controlling the \nphase-shift angles among the H-bridge converters. The obtained \nresults from the simulation studies are compared in terms of core \nshape, effective cross-sectional area, volume, transformer losses, \nand efficiency. Comparison showed that the leakage inductance \nis adversely affected in terms of the insulation and placement of \nthe high voltage winding. As a result, besides the parameters \nsuch as size and efficiency, lower leakage inductance has been \nchosen as the main target. Results showed that model-7 provides \nthe lowest leakage inductance with the highest efficiency level. \nThe flux distribution of this model is given in Fig. 9. It is seen \nthat the maximum flux density is around 0.11691T which is \nbelow the design target limit that is defined by ferrite material \nspecifications. The detailed parameters of the selected optimal \nmodel are given in Table 3. As seen from the results, the total \nloss of the transformer is obtained as 73.4W, and then the \nefficiency of the transformer is calculated as 99.7%. \nFig. 10 shows the ports currents and voltages waveforms \nobtained from ANSYS Maxwell-3D/ANSYS-Simplorer co-\nsimulation results for Model-7. As can be seen from the figure, \nwhile the PV and grid port currents are in one direction, the load \nand energy storage port currents are in reverse direction. At this \ninstant, the grid and PV ports are delivering power to the load \nand energy storage ports. Besides, the losses of the transformer \nand efficiency of the proposed transformer is calculated and \nvariation of the transformer efficiency versus load level is given \nin Fig. 10(c).  \n \nFig. 8: Maxwell-3D/Simplorer Transient-Transient Co-Simulation model \n \n \nFig. 9.

Simulation results for Model-7. \nIV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND TEST RESULTS \nAfter the desired design specifications are achieved for \nsimulation studies, the designed transformer is built. In Fig. 11a, \na picture of the built transformer is shown. The windings are \nplaced on the middle leg core with interwinding insulation \nlayers. All three low voltage port windings are wrapped \ntogether to increase the coupling coefficient. Core to core, \nwinding to winding, and core to winding insulation are \ncarefully considered in this process. A cold plate is used for \nthermal management and heat dissipation. As a final process, \nthe transformer can be potted to improve both the insulation and \nthe thermal conductivity. However, since this structure was \nused in experimental studies, this method was not used. \nTo test the transformer, three DAB converters are designed \nand implemented using 1.2kV SiC MOSFETs. Since the MV \nport is considered as the load port (for testing purposes as high \nvoltage switches are not available), a MV bridge rectifier is \nimplemented by using SiC Diodes with 1.7kV voltage rating. \nSix series-connected diodes were used for each MV bridge \nrectifier’s single diode at the load side and complete rectifier \nunit is given in Fig. 11b. MV load port is loaded with 13.6kOhm \nresistor bank and an external 20uH to limit the peak current at \nthe LV switches side. The experimental set-up implemented to \ntest the designed MV four-port MPSST is depicted in Fig. 12. \nAll MOSFET modules and drivers, control board, signal \nconditioning board, MV four-port transformer, and MV \nrectifier can be seen from the figure.  \n \n(a)                                                   (b) \nFig. 11. (a) The designed transformer (186/152/90mm Width/Height/Depth). \n(b) MV Bridge Rectifier at the load side. \n \nFig. 12. MV four-port transformer test set-up. \nFor limitation in switches current and power supply used, \ntwo ports were tested to reach and validate the 7.4kV at 4kW \npower level. To test the system, voltage level was increased \ngradually. In Figs. 13 and 14, waveforms of the port voltages \n\n102 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 6, NO. 1, MARCH 2022 \nand currents are depicted for 3.6kV and 5.6kV, respectively. \nThen, the system is tested at its rated value 7.4kV as can be seen \nin Fig. 15. As it can be seen from the figures there is a low \nfrequency swinging. Since availability of the high voltage \nswitches are limited, in this study, (as explained above) serial \nconnected 1.7kV diodes are used to design the rectifier used in \nthe MV port. Similar situation is valid for the DC capacitors, \nserial connected capacitors are used to reach up to 7.4kV. In \naddition, for safety reasons, long Litz wires are used to connect \nthe transformer to the MV bridge rectifier PCB. However, the \nresultant inductances of the connection port and parasitic \ncapacitances of the rectifier interact and cause the swinging \nseen in the testing result waveforms. In these figures, the MV \nvoltage probe attenuation factor is 2000 while the maximum \nfactor in the oscilloscope is 1000 (Model CT4079). Therefore, \nthe real MV port voltage is twice the voltage measured by the \noscilloscope. As the medium voltage has been verified, the next \nstep will be to lower the voltage (again, power supply limitation) \nand test all the ports and analyze the power flow with the closed \nloop control implemented [21].  \nWhen the experimental and simulation results are compared, \nit is seen that the results are consistent. Thus, the four-port \nconverter structure capable of 50kHz switching has been \nsuccessfully tested at 7.4kV medium voltage level. \n \nFig. 13.

CONCLUSION \nIn this study, a four-port SST which can connect four \ndifferent load or source ports together is designed for microgrid \napplications. One port of the transformer is designed to be \noperate at MV (compatible with 4.16kV AC voltage). Different \ndesign models are considered, and optimal design is obtained. \nThe obtained design model simulated and with FEA software \nand 99.7% transformer efficiency is obtained. Then, the \ndesigned transformer is implemented. In addition, to test the \ntransformer, a test set-up including LV full-bridge converters, \nMV rectifier is implemented. 7.4kV voltage level is reached and \nvalidated. \nREFERENCES \n[1] W.
