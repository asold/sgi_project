Introduction\nGeomagnetic Induced Currents (GICs) are currents related\nto\n current\n ﬂow in the ionosphere that interact with power sys-\ntems. These currents are associated with solar storm activity\nand produce currents in the power grid that ﬂow through trans-\nmission lines. These currents have a very low-frequency of\n0.01–0.001 Hz (quasi DC) with average magnitudes of 10–15 A\nand peaks of up to 100 A for 1–2 min (Heindl et al., 2011).\nTransformers with star connections and grounded neutrals\nthat are linked by long transmission lines, as depicted in Figure 1,\nare susceptible to GICs problems due to the induced currents\nthat ﬂow through the transmission line and the neutrals that are\ngrounded to close the circuit.\nSeveral\n undesirable effects, produced by GICs in electrical\npower grids and transformers, have been reported. Moreover,\n∗ Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: jrr@iie.org.mx (J.H.

The reported failures in transformers due to\nGICs are mainly dielectric and not a result of overheating. The\neffects of GICs on the grid and the transformers are summarized\nas\n follow: effects on the electric grid; on the one side when the\nreactive loads in the system are changed, the protections are mis-\naligned and the internal resonant frequencies of the transformer\nchange.\nThis process generates voltage surges that eventually degrade\nthe insulation. On the other side, the magnetization impedance\ndecreases, and the magnetizing current and the losses without\nloading increase. Reactive load absorption can cause instability\nin the electric grid (Berge, Varma, & Marti, 2011). Moreover,\nharmonics are contributed to the system, and even harmonics\nare generated.\nEffects on the transformers are related to the relative permit-\ntivity of the magnetic core and the magnetization impedance\ndecrease signiﬁcantly (Bolduc, Gaudreau, & Dutil, 2000; Price,\n2001). The magnetic core losses increase due to hysteresis, and\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jart.2016.04.003\n1665-6423/All Rights Reserved © 2016 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Centro de Ciencias Aplicadas y Desarrollo Tecnológico.

Furthermore, the skin effect that is associated\nwith harmonics in the current and in the magnetic ﬂux increases.\nHeat increases in the ﬁttings and tank due to the effects of eddy\ncurrents\n that are associated with increasing stray ﬂux and with\nthe appearance of even harmonics (Picher, Bolduc, Dutil, &\nPham,\n 1997; Walling & Khan, 1991; Zhigang et al., 2010). The\nﬁrst harmonic vibration component in the transformer arises due\nto magnetostriction. Residual magnetism occurs in the core even\nwhen GICs are no longer present and the Inrush phenomenon\noccurs until the transient has died away.\nThese effects make it difﬁcult to determine transformer\ndesign parameters that consider the effects of the GICs and\nadequately\n support them. The simulation of these operating con-\nditions with a reduced-scale functional model provides useful\ninformation regarding the non-linear behavior of the trans-\nformer. In a real power transformer, these tests are very difﬁcult\nto carry out, due to the big magnitudes of the currents and\npowers involved. This problem was resolved by using approxi-\nmate\n numerical solutions. However, only real measurements are\ncapable of validating these results. Currently, digital simulation\ntools do not account for time-dependent asymmetric saturation,\nwhich requires the development of speciﬁc models for each type\nof transformer (Egorov, 2007). The approach proposed in this\nwork considers a fabricated small reduced-scale transformer, an\nexperimental setup that permits the simulation of GICs and the\nuse of instrumentation for measuring key variables.\n2. Reduced-scale model and GICs simulator\nThe transformer model is speciﬁed and scaled in order to\nsimulate GICs effects over real transformers. The focus in this\nwork is to simulate only the core losses, losses in the wind-\nings produced by GICs, which are the dominant sources of\nheat associated with the currents and magnetic ﬂuxes harmonic\ncontent.\nVac\nIp\nVp Vs\nIs\nR\nTemperature\nBleakage\nIDC\nFig. 2. Monophasic transformer GIC simulator block diagram.\n2.1. Reduced-scale transformer\nTo manufacture transformer scaled must consider several\ndesign parameters so that their behavior is as close as possi-\nble to real transformers. For example, the operating point of the\nmagnetic core is desired to be equal to the real transformers. The\nsectional area of the magnetic core and windings must be scaled\nbased on the transformer’s power. High voltage windings were\nnot considered since only the effects of the currents in the trans-\nformer are intended to be analyzed. A single phase of a three\nphase transformer bank scaled manufactured to simulate in the\nGICs was selected.\n2.2. Structure of the GICs simulator\nThe simulator consists of a transformer with single-phase\nreduced scale with three legs, a controllable current source, a\nresistive load and the electronic instrumentation data acquisition\nsystem for measuring the primary and secondary voltages and\ncurrents, DC current in order to simulate GICs, the density stray\nmagnetic ﬂux outside the magnetic core and the temperature\nof the transformer core for different operating points. Figure 2\nshows a simpliﬁed schematic diagram of the simulator.\nThe scaled single-phase transformer\n was designed to be feed\nwith\n a voltage of 120 V in the primary and the secondary 6.0 V\nand a load current in the secondary of 100 mA and shell-type\nconstruction. A resistive load of 50 /Omega1, which is the rated trans-\nformer load, was considered. The objective of this simulator is\nto evaluate the effect of GICs with the transformer operating at\nits rated load.\nThe reduced-scale transformer is feed by a variac that allows\nchanging the supply voltage from 0 to 120 VAC . The source\nof DC current “IDC” that simulates the GICs, allows the cur-\nrent supplied to the secondary of the transformer to be adjusted\nfrom 0 to 250 mA DC, from 0 to 250% of the value RMS of\nnominal current. The IDC current mainly ﬂows through the sec-\nondary winding of the transformer because its resistance is 1/50\nof the load resistance. The currents in the primary and secondary\ntransformer are measured by resistive shunts, and the voltage\nmeasurement points have voltage dividers that are appropri-\nate for not exceeding the voltage limits of the data acquisition\nsystem.\nThe\n stray magnetic-ﬂux density is measured with a Hall-\neffect sensor that is located in the external portion of the core,\nat the central leg and parallel to the magnetic ﬂux that is pro-\nduced by the transformer winding. This localization was chosen\nJ. Ramírez-Ni˜no et al. / Journal of Applied Research and Technology 14 (2016) 87–92 89\nto determine the leakage ﬂux that leaves the magnetic core when\nGICs are present. The temperature is measured with an LM35\nsensor that is attached to the magnetic core. The reason for the\ntemperature measurement in the magnetic core is to determine\nthe\n increase of heat produced by harmonics associated with\nGICs. The DC source current, the Hall-effect sensor and the\ntemperature meter were powered with an independent AC/DC\nsource.\n2.3. Instrumentation\nThe instrumentation is based on a commercial data acqui-\nsition system that digitizes the measured variables at a rate\nof 20,000 samples/second. A control program that was devel-\noped in graphical language allows the instrument to acquire the\nwaveforms of the measured variables simultaneously.\nThe control program allows the user to visualize the behavior\nof the variables in time and frequency domain. The frequency\nspectrum of the measured waveforms is spread out by using\na discrete Fourier transform via a Hamming window, and the\nroot\n mean square (RMS) values and the THD (Total Harmonic\nDistortion)\n of the involved variables are also spread out. The\nprogram also shows the behavior of the saturation curve for each\noperating point. The temperature behavior during the test can\nbe used to estimate the losses associated with each simulation\nexecution.\n3. Simulation results and discussion\n3.1. Asymmetric non-linearity with GICs and its effect on\nwaveforms\nThe voltage waveform in the primary corresponds to the sup-\nplied AC power, which is a low-impedance source. The primary\ncurrent shows\n signiﬁcant changes as the IDC current increases\nin the secondary. The average value of the primary current is\nzero, but the waveform indicates half-wave asymmetry. The peak\nvalue of the current is higher by a half-wave compared to the\nother. This difference demonstrates the decreasing magnetiza-\ntion impedance in the half-cycle, when the peak current is larger.\nFigure 3 shows two current waveforms that are seen from the\nprimary. The red curve has no IDC component, while the blue\ncurve\n corresponds to the primary current plus IDC component\nin the secondary which simulates the GICs. The voltages at the\nsecondary positive and negative peaks are deformed due to sym-\nmetrical saturation under normal conditions. However, when the\nIDC component is present, the half-wave symmetry is lost, and\nthe duty cycle is asymmetrical.\nFigure 4 shows the current waveforms of two conditions on\nthe\n secondary, with and without IDC current that were measured\non transformer winding.\n3.2. The behavior of the generated harmonics\nThe voltages and currents waveforms in the secondary of the\ntransformer during nominal operating condition, where the fun-\ndamental frequency can be 50 Hz or 60 Hz, have symmetry of\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\nCurrent mA\n10\n0\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02\nTime\n0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04\nFig. 3.

Thus, the harmonic components of 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . represent\nthe components that possess these waveforms and satisfy the\nfollowing property:\nf (x) = −f (x + T/2) (1)\nwhere T is the period of the periodic signal.\nWhen the GICs ﬂow through the secondary winding, even\nharmonics are generated as a product of asymmetric nonlinear-\nity and the magnitude of the odd harmonic components remains\nconstant. Even harmonic components appear in the primary and\nsecondary current and secondary voltage. Figure 5 shows the\nharmonic components of the primary current with and with-\nout\n GICs, depicted as solid red and blue curves, respectively.\nFigure 6 shows the changing magnitudes of the largest harmon-\nics as a function the magnitudes of the IDCs.\n90 J.

Magnetic-core operating point and losses from\nhysteresis\nThe operating point of the magnetic core is obtained from\nthe graphical representation of the magnetic ﬂux density (B) and\nthe magnetic ﬁeld intensity (H). The BH curve shows how the\nmagnetic ﬂux density changes as the alignment of the magnetic\ndomains changes within the magnetic circuit. Once all domains\nhave\n been aligned, the saturation point is reached, and further\nincreases in magnetic ﬁeld intensity have little changes of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density. The area of the hysteresis loop corre-\nsponds to the energy dissipated as heat by the magnetization and\ndemagnetization process during each cycle. Figure 7 shows two\noperation conditions with and without an IDC component. These\ncurves are obtained by plotting the integral of the secondary volt-\nage (proportional to magnetic ﬂux density “B”) on the vertical\naxis\n and primary current on the transformer (proportional to\nampere*turns “H”) on the horizontal axis.\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nB tesla\n–0.5\n–1.0\n–1.5\n–2.0\n–60.0 –50.0 –40.0 –30.0 –20.0 –10.0 0.0 10.0 20.0\nH au\n30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 90.0\nFig. 7. Transformer magnetization curves with and without GIC depicted as red\nand blue lines, respectively, where the hysteresis curve is observed.\nA qualitative analysis indicated that the saturation curve is\nsymmetric about the vertical axis when no DC current is present.\nHowever, when the DC component is present, the curve shifts to\nthe right in the ﬁrst quadrant, which indicates increasing satura-\ntion.\n In contrast, the saturation decreases in the third quadrant.\nNo signiﬁcant\n change was found in the area of the hysteresis\ncurve\n when the GICs levels are present. However, when the GICs\nlevel is higher, the area increased due to the level of harmonics\nincrease.\n3.4. Stray magnetic ﬂux density and its relationship with\nthe\n magnetization\n current\nThe waveform of the magnetic ﬂux density measured in the\nouter portion of the core is similar to the current waveform\nmeasured in primary of the transformer (Fig. 3). Therefore, the\nmagnetic ﬂux density and the current in the primary of the trans-\nformer have the same harmonic content. Similarly, the magnetic\nﬂux density has a DC component only when GICs are present.\nFigure 8 provides a comparison of the two waveforms. The curve\nin blue corresponds to the presence of GICs, and the curve in\nred corresponds to the absence of GICs.\nThe\n magnetic ﬂux density can be measured in the ﬁttings and\ntank and with this information; losses in the critical mechanical\nparts of the transformer can be estimated.\n3.5. Impedance as seen from the primary\nThe relationship between the voltage and current RMS val-\nues gives an idea of the impedance magnitude when the GICs\noccur. When a DC component is present in the secondary, the\nimpedance\n varies as follows:\nZ = a − b(IDC)2 (2)\nwhere a and b are parameters that depend on the supply voltage.\nFigure 9 shows the impedance behavior as a function of the\nJ.

The reactive\npower change is from 100% to 166% V ARs (under the same\nconditions), which corresponds to an increase of 66% in the\nabsence of the IDC. In contrast, the peak instantaneous power\nvalues increase by 29%.\nIf we consider the product of the “RMS” voltage and cur-\nrent, the magnitude of the apparent power can be obtained.

The temperature measurement results on the transformer core.\ndisplays a parabolic behavior that is similar to the behavior that\nis presented in Figure 9.\n3.7. Thermal behavior\nThe amount of heat generated by the core losses (in the wind-\nings and ﬁttings) results in non-uniform temperature increases\nin the transformer. However, if the total concentrated losses\nare considered, the temperature increase follows an exponential\nfunction relative to the amount of heat generated by all losses, the\ntransformer mass, the environmental temperature and time evo-\nlution.\n Figure\n 12 shows the temperature measurement results on\nthe\n transformer core. During the ﬁrst period, only losses from the\ntransformer occurred. The temperature tends to stabilize during\nthe second period. In addition, when the DC current is applied,\nthe temperature of the transformer increases.\nThe performance of the core temperature with and without\nthe IDC can be approximated by using the following equations:\nT = 6.6 ∗ (1 − e−0.06t) + 23.6 (4)\nT = 25 ∗ (1 − e−0.017(t−52)) + 29.5 (5)\nwhere T represents the temperature (◦C) and t is time (min). Eq.\n(4) is only valid over the time interval of 0 < t < 52, while Eq. (5)\nis only valid for t > 52. The time constants in Eqs. (4) and (5)\nare different because new heat sources appear when the GICs\nare present. For example, the heat produced by “eddy currents\nlosses” on the\n core and windings.\n4. Conclusions\nThe simulation of GICs using a reduced-scale transformer\nmodel provide insight into the effects that occur on parame-\nters such as voltage, current, power, magnetic ﬂux and thermal\nbehavior.\n This simulation permits to observe the harmonics con-\nduct produced at the operating point of the magnetic core. In\naddition, the losses and the reactive load variations can be esti-\nmated when the GICs are present. Changes can be observed in\nthe operating point of the transformer due to the GICs, which\nmainly affect real power transference, variation in its impedance\nand the increase of losses. Each transformer has a unique electri-\ncal, magnetic and mechanical design in which the characteristics\nof the materials are very important. Therefore, to apply the pro-\nposed solution, manufacturing a scale model and the simulation\nof its behavior\n under the effect of GICs is required for each\ntransformer design. The information obtained from the simula-\ntion can be used to obtain design rules and validate mathematical\nsimulation models. Consequently, design rules can be optimized\nconsidering the GICs. Future studies will aim to develop elab-\norate scale models for real transformers in order to simulate\ntheir behavior under the inﬂuence of the GICs. Further studies\nwill explore the effects of GICs in three-phase transformers with\nthree, four, ﬁve legs and power of 100 kV A, which will be con-\nstructed with different design criteria. One current technological\nchallenge is the establishment of test methods for evaluating\nthe performance of transformers with more than 1 MV A when\ninﬂuenced\n by GICs.\nConﬂict of interest\nThe authors have no conﬂicts of interest to declare.\nReferences\nBerge, J., Varma, R.
