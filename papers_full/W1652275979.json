    "abstract": "Power flow controlling devices such as phase shifting transformers are increasingly important in the power system. They can increase reliability and can serve as an alternative to new investments in overhead lines, which are difficult due to a lack of public support. Furthermore, they are an important means of control for a transmission system operator in the liberalized market. HVDC links recently also got renewed attention as they do not only provide the possibility to control the power flow, but can also be economically competitive to underground ac cables [1]. Especially with the emergence of VSC HVDC applications for bulk power transport, HVDC is a real alternative in the meshed power system. The usage of power flow controlling devices in a meshed grid causes the power to flow along alternative paths. However, these devices, and especially HVDC and VSC HVDC, incorporate significant losses. Furthermore, the shifting of power to other lines can cause losses in other parts of the grid. In this paper, the losses caused by the different power flow controlling elements are discussed, and afterwards their influence on the power system losses of a meshed grid are investigated. An important issue that is addressed in this paper is the use of multiple power flow controlling devices in one grid, consisting of multiple control areas.",
