  "abstract": "Port Scanning is a method which is used in the vulnerability Detection of a host Machine. Port scanning is a phase in footprinting and scanning; this comes in reconnaissance which is considered as the first stage of a computer attack. However there are different methods that can be used in different circumstances to perform a port scanning. But each method has its own cons and pros. This survey paper presents few such methods that was developed long ago but are in constant research and the tools that employ these methods. The paper presents different methods and compares them.",
