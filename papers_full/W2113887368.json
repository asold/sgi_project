The increasing interest in process engineering and\napplication integration has resulted in the appearance of various new\nprocess modelling languages. Understanding and comparing such\nlanguages has therefore become a major problem in information\nsystems research and development. We suggest a framework to solve\nthis problem involving several instruments: a general process meta-\nmodel with a table, an analysis of the event concept, and a classification\nof concepts according to the interrogative pronouns: what, how, why,\nwho, when, and where. This framework can be used for several\npurposes, such as translating between languages or verifying that\nrelevant organisational aspects have been captured. To validate the\nframework, three different process modelling languages have been\ncompared: Business Modelling Language (BML), Event-driven Process\nChains (EPC) and UML State Diagrams.\n1 Introduction\nBusiness Process Modelling has become a major focus of attention in Information\nSystems Engineering, in order to create efficiency, quality and customer satisfaction.\nProcess models can be used for planning, design, simulation and automatic execution\nof business processes, e.g. in Workflow Management Systems and Process Brokers\n[1, 2]. Furthermore, methods like Total Quality Management and Business Process\nReengineering, and software packages like SAP R/3 and Baan ERP all have put the\nbusiness processes in the centre of analysis. As a result, several different process\nmodelling languages have been developed, e.g. Business Modelling Language, Event-\ndriven Process Chains, and UML Activity and State Diagrams. However, these\nlanguages often define and use concepts in different and sometimes ambiguous ways,\nwhich makes comparisons between and integration of process models difficult.\nTowards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages      601\nLanguage comparison can be made easier by using e.g. a meta-model. The reason\nis that the meta-model provides a graphical illustration of the basic concepts and their\nrelations that is easy to grasp even for non-experts on process modelling languages.\nThe purpose of this paper is to suggest a framework that aims at making comparisons\nbetween business process modelling languages easier to perform. The framework\nconsists of several instruments: a general process meta-model, an analysis of the event\nconcept, and a classification of concepts according to the interrogative pronouns:\nwhat, how, why, who, when, and where. The intended users of the framework are\nIS/IT-managers, business people and other stakeholders involved in business process\nmanagement in different domains. The framework must therefore: firstly, be easy to\nunderstand for people not familiar with process modelling; secondly, include basic\nbusiness concepts that are central to business process management (e.g. activity,\nevent, actor, location, resource and time); and thirdly, be extensible to enable users to\ncomplement it with concepts of interest to a certain business domain.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Related research in Chapter 2 presents\napproaches such as meta-modelling and ontology analysis for comparing and\nevaluating process modelling languages. Chapter 3 presents a process meta-model, an\nanalysis of the event concept and a classification of the concepts according to the\ninterrogative pronouns. Chapter 4 introduces three process modelling languages: EPC,\nUML State diagram and BML. In chapter 5, the meta-model is used to compare the\nthree such languages, and the result is presented in a in a table (referred to as a\ncomparison matrix). Chapter 6 contains conclusions and directions for further\nresearch.\n2 Related Research\nMeta-models, ontologies and conceptual models are often used to describe and\nanalyse the relations between concepts. A model is an abstraction of phenomena in\nthe real world, and a meta-model is yet another abstraction highlighting properties of\nthe model itself [3]. Meta-modelling is closely related to, and to some extent\noverlapping, ontology analysis and conceptual modelling.\nOntology is a philosophical discipline where the nature of the real world is studied.\nSome ontologies attempt to define basic concepts in a certain domain, e.g. medicine\nor automobile manufacturing, while others try to be more domain independent. The\nBunge, Wand and Weber (BWW) ontology [4\n, 5] is domain independent. Wand and\nWeber [5, 6] have used the BWW ontology to provide a theoretical foundation for the\nevaluation of information systems models. They assume that an information system\n(IS) represents a real world system, and that it is built to manage information process\nfunctions in this real world. They present a set of basic real world concepts that IS\nmodels should be able to express. By mapping the concepts (e.g. thing, state, event\nand system) to concepts in different languages, Wand and Weber discuss strengths\nand weaknesses in these languages. However, some concepts in this ontology are\ndifficult for non-experts to map to concepts in everyday process modelling languages.\nExamples of models of process concepts  are the Workflow Management Coalition\nWfMC reference model [7] and the FRISCO report [8]. In the WfMC reference\nmodel, terminology, structure, components and interfaces for workflow management\n602      Eva Söderström et al.\nsystems and languages are defined. The FRISCO report also defines central concepts\nin the IS area (e.g. process, state and action), but its definitions of are different from\nthose given by WfMC. None of these models show how concepts from different types\nof process modelling languages, e.g. activity-oriented, state-oriented and\ncommunication-oriented languages, relate to one another. Activity-oriented languages\nprimarily describe which activities follow and precede another in a process. Examples\nof such languages are UML Activity Diagram [9], Task Structures [10], and Event-\ndriven Process Chain (EPC) [11, 12]. State-oriented languages, for instance UML\nState Diagram  [9], describe which states follow and precede another in a process.\nSDL [13] and Business Modeling Language (BML) [2, 14] are examples of\ncommunication-oriented languages that focus on the interaction between people and\nsystems, and between systems.\nThe basic grammar of most process modelling languages derives from Petri nets\n[15], which provide both a graphical description and formal definition of processes.\nResearchers [16, 10] have mapped EPC and Task Structures to Petri nets to give the\nlanguages formal semantics, and hence to verify the correctness (soundness) of the\nprocess definitions. This approach could be used to compare different process\nmodelling languages, but Petri net analysis are for method experts and cannot easily\nwork as a platform for communication between business people. Furthermore, a\nprocess modelling language for business process management must include more\nconcepts than just places, transitions and tokens that are present in classical Petri nets.\nWe have grouped the meta-model concepts according to a set of interrogative\npronouns to clarify what aspects of processes that different concepts represent. Other\nresearchers that use interrogative pronouns to structure their analysis are Zachman\n[17] who uses them to classify a descriptive representation of an enterprise with focus\non managing and developing an enterprises system and Bunge [18] who uses the\npronouns to understand and separate basic types of domain-dependent problems.\n3 The Framework\nThe framework will be explained starting with the basic concepts, before the meta-\nmodel is introduced. Finally, we explain how and why the interrogative pronouns\nhave been used in the meta-model.\n3.1 Basic Concepts\nMost process modelling languages include at least four basic concepts: time point,\nactivity, state and event, i.e. these four concepts are the common denominators of\nprocess modelling languages. Intuitively, a  time point is an instant in time, not further\ndecomposable. An activity is a performance of some sort, possibly changing some\nthings state, i.e. its set of properties. An event is a noteworthy occurrence. Usually,\none is interested in particular events associated with changes of state, i.e. activities are\ninvolved in some way. Activities, states and the running of time can be thought of as\nexisting regardless of an observer but events are some facts about a thing that an\nobserver notice and records by some means.\nTowards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages      603\nMost process modelling languages agree on the general meaning of these concepts\nand their definitions are usually precise but differ in some respects. The greatest\ndifferences between the languages lie in the understanding of the relations between\nthe concepts. We claim that it is useful to consider an event as a connector that\nconnects states and activities in time as is schematically illustrated by the lines from\nevent to the other three concepts in Fig.1. One reason why languages differ is that\nactivities, states and time can be connected in many ways and this suggests that the\nrelations between the concepts are best understood by analysing the event concept.\nActivity\nTime Point\nState\nEvent\nFig. 1. The intuitive relation between the event concept and other basic concepts\nThe following event types were identified in an analysis of the event concept from\nthe languages BML, UML State Diagram, and EPC:\n• Events can either record a certain point in time ( time point events) or record the\ntime between two time points (time duration events).\n• Events can either record the start of an activity (pre-activity events) or record the\nend of an activity (post-activity events).\n• Events may record the change of a state (state change events) or not.\nUsing the event types described above in a language analysis, some conclusions\ncan be drawn about the languages and their use of the event concept. Firstly, the\nlanguages define an event as non-similar combinations of the above mentioned event\ntypes. For example, one language defines an event as a combination of post-activity\nand state change events, i.e. the completion of an activity always leads to a change of\nthe process state. Other languages define event as a combination of time point and\npre-activity events, and so on. Secondly, some languages do not recognise differences\nbetween event types as they are presented above, e.g. by not distinguishing between\npre-activity and post-activity events.\n3.2 The Meta-model\nFigure 2 shows the meta-model, which is divided into two levels: type and instance.\nOn the type level, we find activity, resource, role and logical dependencies between\nactivities. On the instance level, we find event, state, actor, and temporal\ndependencies between events. Thus, the meta-model includes some additional\nconcepts besides the basic ones to make it more useful in a business setting.\nA process is modelled on a type level as a structure of logical dependencies\nbetween activities. These activities use one or more resources as input, and produces\none or more resources as output. One specific type of resource, the role, is regarded to\nbe responsible for that one or more activities will be performed.\n604      Eva Söderström et al.\nThe execution of a process is regarded to be a time-bound series of events, caused\nby an actor. These events may result in a state change for a resource. An actor who\ncauses an event always has an intention with his/her actions to achieve a specific state\nfor a resource. The state can be either different from the resources current state, or it\ncan be the same state as the current one.

The meta-model\nAn actor is regarded to be an instantiation of a role, a state is viewed as an instance\nof a resource, and an event is an instance of an activity. In the latter case, our\nperception of an activity is through the event that initiates and/or terminates it. An\nevent always occurs at a certain time point or between two time points on a certain\nlocation.\n3.3 Interrogative Pronouns\nThe interrogative pronouns: where, who, how, when, what and why, have been\ninserted into the meta-model to enhance readability and understandability. They\nprovide an easy-to-grasp classification of the concepts according to various aspects,\nand also give an intuitive meaning to the abstract concepts.\nThis classification can help organisations to ask questions about their processes\nand process models, and to aid organisations in selecting the process modelling\nlanguage appropriate to their business. For example, an organisation for which actors\nare central can exclude languages that do not model actors, i.e. languages that\ndisregard from the who aspect.\nTowards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages      605\n4 Process Modelling Languages\nEPC, UML State Diagram and BML represent different types of process modelling\nlanguages: an activity-oriented, a state-oriented, and a communication-oriented (see\nsection 2). The three languages are considered to be representative of their respective\ncategory, which motivates their presence in this paper. Following are a short\npresentation of the languages, and a description of how the event concept is used in\nrespective language. This section includes as an example a very short snippet of a\nmanufacturing process to show language symbols and how they are used.\n4.1 Event-Driven Process Chains (EPC)\nEvent-driven Process Chains (EPC) [11] is used for instance to describe business\nprocesses in the SAP/R3 enterprise system. The EPC diagrams are also embedded and\nused in the process view of the Architecture of Integrated Information System (ARIS)\nframework that integrates five different perspectives or views (data, function,\norganisation, output and process) of an organisation [12].\nEPC is a graph with active nodes, called functions (soft rectangles), and passive\nnodes, called events (hexagons), see Fig. 3 (left). In EPC, a process is considered to\nbe a chain of business functions to be executed, and of events describing the situation\nbefore and after each function. EPC does not explicitly use the state concept. The\nlogical relationships and dependencies between functions and events are described\nusing logical connectors (circles including the logical AND, OR and XOR) and\ncontrol flow (arrows). The EPC diagram of Fig. 3 shows that two events, Order\nreceived and Production date arrived  must occur before the business function\nManufacturing can take place. When the function is completed, two additional events\nmust occur: Product in store  and Order executed . The function nodes can be\nconnected to information, material, product and services and responsible\norganisational unit, by adding the other views of the ARIS framework. This is not\nincluded in Fig. 3.\nEPC explicitly uses the following event types:\n• Pre-activity events (i.e. the events before the functions in the EPC diagram).\n• Post-activity events (i.e. the events after the functions in the EPC diagram).\nEPC does not use the following event types:\n• State change events (because EPC does not explicit use the concept state)\nEPC does not explicitly distinguish between following event types:\n• Time point events and Time duration events\nNote that EPC does not explicitly combine any event types.\n606      Eva Söderström et al.\nOrder\nreceived\n Manufacturing\n&\nOrder\nexecuted\nProduct\nin store\n&\nProduction\ndate arrived StateOrder\nreceived\n (and)\nProduktion\ndate arrived\nProduct in\nstore\n (and)\nOrder\nexecuted\nDo activity/\nManufacturing\nWa it\nfor\nEvent\nOrder\nreceived\nProduction\ndate\narrived\nSend to\nManu-\nfacturing\nWait\nfor\nEvent\nProduct\nin store\nOrder\nexecuted End\nFig. 3. Three different modelling languages: EPC (left), UML State Diagram (top, right) and\nBML (down, right)\n4.2 UML State Diagram (SD)\nThe Unified Modelling Language (UML) [19] is an industry standard maintained by\nthe Object Management Group (OMG) [9]. The state  or state-chart  diagram (SD)\nis one of several diagram types in UML. SD is a graphical representation of a state\nmachine and visualises how and under what circumstances a modelled element, e.g. a\nUML class, a system or a business process, changes its state. SD is also used to show\nwhich activities that are executed as a result of events. The SD graph uses symbols for\nstates (soft rectangles), transitions (arrows), events (text labels), and activities (text\nlabels), and always includes a start state (solid circle) and one or more final states\n(bulls-eye), see Fig. 3 (right, top).\nA state consists three components: name, variables (describing local variables like\ncounters and timers), and activities; where all but the name component is optional.\nThe state symbol is divided into three compartments to illustrate this division. The\ndifference between an action and an activity is that an action is non-divisible and non-\ninterruptible, and that an activity can contain several actions. There are three different\ntypes of actions/activities associated with the state of a modelled element: entry\naction (performed when entering the state); exit action  (performed when exiting the\nstate), and do activity (performed while in the state). Fig. 3 only shows the do activity\nManufacturing. A state that does not contain any activities is called a wait state.\nState changes are called transitions (arrows connecting the states). A transition\noccurs if an event occurs and aborts an ongoing do activity, or if a do activity  has\nbeen completed and triggered a completion event. However, before a transition can\noccur, an optional condition called \"guard\" must be evaluated. If the guard evaluates\nto true, the transition occurs, otherwise it will not. During a transition certain actions\ncan be performed. A SD considers events to occur instantaneously, while states have\nduration, but UML does not hinder modellers to redefine events to have duration and\nstates to have no duration. Some additional event types from UML state diagrams are\nomitted in this paper for the sake of brevity.\nTowards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages      607\nSD explicitly uses the following simple or combined event types:\n• Post-activity events (i.e. an event occurs, which aborts an ongoing do activity,\nbut does not trigger a transition since a guard is evaluated to false).\n• Post-activity events and State change events (i.e. an event occurs, which both\naborts an ongoing do activity and triggers a transition).\n• Post-activity events, and Pre-activity events (i.e. an event occurs, which both\naborts an ongoing do activity and initiates the exit action, but does not trigger\na transition because a guard is evaluated false).\n• Post-activity events, Pre-activity events and State change events (i.e. an event\noccurs, which both aborts an ongoing do activity, initiates an optional exit\naction, triggers a transition, triggers some optional actions while in transition,\nand initiates optional entry action and do activities in the next state).\n• State change events (i.e. an event occurs, and the state is a wait state, and the\nevent triggers a transition).\n• Pre-activity events (i.e. an event occurs, and the state is a wait state, and the\nevent initiates an exit action, but does not trigger a transition because a guard\nis evaluated to false).\n• Pre-activity events, and State change events (i.e. an event occurs, and the state is\na wait state, and the event both initiates an optional exit action, triggers a\ntransition, trigger some optional actions while in transition, and initiates\noptional entry action and do activities in the next state).\nSD does not explicitly distinguish between the following event types:\n• Time point events and Time duration events\n4.3 Business Modelling Language (BML)\nThe Business Modelling Language (BML) is used in a Process Broker [2], the\nVisuera Process Manager [14]. BML focuses on describing interactions between\nsystems through the sending and receiving of messages. The language has similarities\nto SDL (Specification and Description Language) [13], but is more adapted to\napplication integration. One important feature of BML is that it can be used for\nbusiness specification and design as well as for the execution of systems.\nBML describes structure and behaviour of a system by using two kinds of\ndiagrams. The Business Process Integration (BPI) diagram shows the system structure\nin terms of its logical decomposition into parts and the communication taking place\nbetween the system and its environment, i.e. external applications and human agents.\nThe communication metaphor is sending and receiving messages through a channel.\nThe Business Integration Application (BIA) diagrams describe the dynamic behaviour\nof the system, visualising when the system sends and receives messages, the rules for\nhandling messages and what activities to perform depending on the messages\ncontents.\nThe BML symbols in the process diagram (BIA), some of which are presented in\nFig. 2 (right, down), are: Receive message (concave box), Send message (convex\nbox), and State (circle). Further BML symbols are: Start timer (hourglass full of\ntime), Expire timer (hourglass out of time), Business activity (rectangle, not\n608      Eva Söderström et al.\nshown), and Automated business decision (rhombus, not shown), which shows what\npaths should be taken through the process according to business rules. BIA always\nincludes a start state (circle without name) and one or more End states (circle with the\nlabel End). A BIA can visualise to which application, human agent or process that a\nmessage is sent to or received from, by using labels (or icons) above the diagrams\nsend and receive symbols (not shown in Fig. 2).\nAn instance of a BIA can either be in a state or in transition from one state to\nanother. A transition is initiated when a message is received or when a timer is\nexpired. Activities that may occur during the transition, e.g. Send message and Start\ntimer, are considered to happen instantaneously.\nBML explicitly uses the following combined event types:\n• Time point events, Pre-activity events and State change events (i.e. a Receive\nMessage or Expire Timer triggers one or several activities, i.e. Send message,\nStart timer and/or, Business activity, and a transition.)\n• Time point events and State change events, (i.e. a Receive Message or BML\nExpire Timer triggers a BML transition, but not an activity.\nBML does not explicitly use the following event types:\n• Post-activity events\n• Time duration events\n5 Language Comparison\nResults from comparing process modelling language using the meta-model is\npresented in Table 1. The table provides a structured overview of defined concepts,\nand clearly indicates some differences between the languages. For example, empty\nboxes in the table illustrate that a particular language does not explicity express this\nconcept. Anyone creating and using the table for language selection is made aware of\nthis fact and can eliminate a language that cannot express desired concepts or extend\nit with the missing concept. Furthermore, the table makes differences in definitions\nbetween the languages explicit, which enables organisations to discover languages\nwhich defines and uses concepts in ways similar to the organisation itself. Creating\nthe table may also provide an opportunity for organisations to reflect about the way\nthey define their own concepts and consider alternative definitions.\n6 Summary and Further Research\nThe framework presented in this paper consists of a meta-model of process concepts\nwith a comparison matrix, a classification of the concepts according to interrogative\npronouns, and an analysis of the event concept. It aims at making comparisons\nbetween various process modelling languages easier. In this summary, we will\nhighlight contributions and strengths of both the parts, and of the framework as a\nwhole. Since the parts provide slightly different views of the same phenomenon, some\nof their contributions will be the same.\nTowards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages      609\nTable 1.

Furthermore, the meta-\n610      Eva Söderström et al.\nmodel is extensible and can thus be adapted to different business domains. It also\nenables organisations to cover many different organisational aspects through the use\nof the interrogative pronouns . These pronouns provide understandability, readability,\nand an easy-to-grasp classification of concepts. The meta-model still needs some\nwork, however, such as a deeper exploration into all the meta-model concepts, and\nreal life cases through which the extensibility of the meta-model can be shown.\nBy using a comparison matrix (or table) to present the results from applying the\nmeta-model, several contributions can be identified. The matrix provides a structured\noverview of defined concepts, and an explicit illustration of definitional differences\nbetween the languages. This enables organisations to identify the language that best\nsuits the organisations own definitions and intentions. Should an organisation lack\nexplicit definitions of its concepts, the matrix can provide a basis for creating such\ndefinitions.\nBy analysing the event concept, we have highlighted that some major differences\nbetween the languages lie in how they use this concept. However, the other basic\nconcepts (activity and state) also need to be analysed to enhance the usefulness of the\nframework, as do the concepts in the complete meta-model (rule, resource, actor, and\ngoal).\nThe framework as a whole was validated by comparing three different process\nmodelling languages: BML, EPC and UML SD. The comparison shows that the\nframework can be used for several purposes, many of them already described in this\nchapter. Different process modelling languages can be compared with respect to their\nconcepts definitions, concept relationships, and correspondences of concepts between\nlanguages. The result provides a basis for selecting the process modelling language\nthat best suites the organisational needs. The framework can also be used as a\ntranslation instrument between process modelling languages, and to identify what\norganisational aspects that the languages cover. As mentioned, the framework still\nneeds some work: a method for using the framework, including step-by-step\nguidelines for how to perform e.g. language comparisons, needs to be developed.\nFurthermore, more formal definitions of the basic concepts are needed, as are\nexperiences from real life case studies where the framework is applied, validated and\nverified.\nReferences\n1.
