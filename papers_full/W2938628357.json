    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare and evaluate the accuracy of three screening tools in identifying illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse among a diverse sample of pregnant women. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study enrolled a consecutive sample of 500 pregnant women, stratified by trimester, receiving care in two prenatal clinical settings in Baltimore, Maryland, from January 2017 to January 2018. All participants were administered three index tests: 4P's Plus, NIDA Quick Screen-ASSIST (Modified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test), and the SURP-P (Substance Use Risk Profile-Pregnancy) scale, and administered reference tests (urine and hair drug testing) at the in-person baseline visit. To assess test–retest reliability of the index tests, screening tool administrations were repeated 1 week later by telephone. For each screening tool, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and test–retest reliability were computed. Results were stratified by age, race, and trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: Of the 500 enrolled pregnant women, 494 completed the index screening tools, 497 completed reference testing, and 453 underwent test–retest analysis. For the 4P's Plus, sensitivity=90.2% (84.5, 93.8), and specificity=29.6% (24.4, 35.2). For the NIDA Quick Screen-ASSIST, sensitivity=79.7% (71.2, 84.2), and specificity=82.8% (78.1, 87.1). For the SURP-P, sensitivity=92.4% (87.6, 95.8) and specificity=21.8% (17.4, 27.2). Test–retest reliability (phi correlation coefficients) was 0.84, 0.77, and 0.79 for the 4P's Plus, NIDA Quick Screen-ASSIST and the SURP-P, respectively. For all screening tools, there were differences in validity indices by age and race, but no differences by trimester. CONCLUSION: The SURP-P and 4P's Plus had high sensitivity and negative predictive values, making them more ideal screening tests than the NIDA Quick Screen-ASSIST. A clear recommendation for a clinically useful screening tool for prenatal substance use is crucial to allow for prompt and appropriate follow-up and intervention.",

Although it is judged not \nacceptable for publication in Obstetrics & Gynecology in its present form, we would be willing to give further consideration \nto a revised version.\nIf you wish to consider revising your manuscript, you will first need to study carefully the enclosed reports submitted by \nthe referees and editors. Each point raised requires a response, by either revising your manuscript or making a clear and \nconvincing argument as to why no revision is needed. To facilitate our review, we prefer that the cover letter include the \ncomments made by the reviewers and the editor followed by your response. The revised manuscript should indicate the \nposition of all changes made. We suggest that you use the \"track changes\" feature in your word processing software to do \nso (rather than strikethrough or underline formatting).\nYour paper will be maintained in active status for 21 days from the date of this letter. If we have not heard from you by \nFeb 07, 2019, we will assume you wish to withdraw the manuscript from further consideration.\nREVIEWER COMMENTS:\nReviewer #1: Thank you for your important work.\nIn terms of disclosures, since the primary author lists a corporation, there should be some disclosure about how or if that \nemployment impacts upon or relates to the study.\nAbstract: well written overall.  I would use one sentence in the objectives to tell us why he screens are needed (rather \nthan just doing universal testing?)\nIntroduction: lines 81-3, while they say that screening should be universal, I assumed this to mean urine or blood screen. \nWhat advantage do you see to a questionnaire screen? In other words, make the case as to what this type of screening will \nadd to prenatal care.\nMethods: you do a really nice job of describing your methods and process.\nResults: you do not need to re-describe values in tables 4 and 5 in the text.\nDiscussion: Again, I am still not convinced that you have mad the case for me for using these screen rather than doing \nroutine urine screens.  Patients with problematic drug use will likely be actively using through pregnancy and will be \npositive.  If someone used cannabis but stopped upon discovering the pregnancy, it seems that this may not be relevant.\nReviewer #2: Doing the type of study reported here is fraught with difficulties and these investigators have overcome  \nmany of them in this well designed and performed study. The manuscript is clearly written and understandable by non-\nsubstance use specialists and scientists. The conclusions are, for the most part warranted. There are, however, several \nissues that should be addressed.\n1. I'd recommend using he term substance use disorder and avoiding pejorative terms whenever possible.\n2. Line 138. It should be noted whether the decision to consider moderate and high risk as positive screens was made a \nView Letter .\n1 of 6 2/11/2019, 10:09 AM\n\npriori or post hoc. The former would be more rigorous, the latter more susceptible to bias.\n3. Line 153ff. The choice of urine and hair tests as the gold standard here has strengths and weaknesses. Each has \nsensitivity issues, for example. These should be noted in more detail in the discussion. Further, neither are useful for \npicking up alcohol and indeed no alcohol is reported as detected here (Table 3). The screens, however, include alcohol, \nwhich would impact the measures of merit. This should be noted in the manuscript and very likely suggests that a different \nscreener should be used for alcohol use during pregnancy -- VERY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE MULTIPLE DOCUMENTED \nANATOMIC AND NEURODEVELOPMENTS BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES REPROTED WITH FETAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE.\n4. Line 165.The power analysis is under-discribed. It would be sensitive to the anticipated prevalence of positive and \nnegative outcome measures. I don't understand the statements re false negative -- surely not a standard way of \ndetermining sample size or at least of reporting on it.\n5. Line 181. The test-retest reliability is probably overestimated, given learning effects with data being re-collected so \nclose together and perhaps patients wanting to please the research staff (social desirability); this might be noted in ht \nmanuscript\n6. Line 215ff. The specificity by race differnces need some discussion later in the paper. It's surey not clear to me why \nthese should have occurred.\n7. Line 263. The non-relevance of these findings re alcohol screening in pregnancy should be included here.\n8. Line 280. Universal screening is not supported by the findings in this study -- no evidence for enhancing outcomes or \nreducing costs, especially when you've mentioned negatives like incarceration above. The results would support the use of \nthe two screeners for ilicit drugs in pregnancy.\nReviewer #3: \nLine 47 - It is probably unnecessary to give the sample size in the precis.\nThe introduction is well written, and the authors appear to be knowledgeable about the subject.  The goal of this \nmanuscript is to identify quality screening instruments for prenatal substance abuse.\nLine 166 - The author's description of the sample size calculation should be more detailed.  The authors previously \npublished (BMJ Open. 2018 Feb 17;8(2): e020248 PMID 29455170) this description.\nThe overall study design is appropriate with the following limitations: 1) Two of the three survey instruments have been \nstudied in pregnancy.  Not surprising they performed better. 2) The applaud the efforts to obtain biological specimens. The \ntrade-off is that the sample may not reflect the general population.  Interestingly, biological data and patient self-reporting \nare reasonably correlated.\nTable 1 - Do the authors have permission to publish 4P's PLUS questionnaire?  It is my understanding that this is \nproprietary.\nTable 3 - This prevalence data could be presented better with a bar graph\nSTATISTICAL EDITOR COMMENTS:\nThe Statistical Editor makes the following points that need to be addressed:\nTable 3: Need to include CIs for all the prevalence estimates. Footnote should be added clarifying how a (+) was \nestablished: by examination of either hair or urine, or by requiring both (Table 4 implies that the results were slightly \ndifferent.  If substantially different, should add a supplemental table showing various criteria for (+) prevalence.\nTable 4: The NPV and PPV estimates do not apply to other populations with different prevalence rates of (+) substance.  A \nbetter metric would be LR(+) and LR(-).  Also, given the sample sizes, should round values to nearest .1, not.01 and \nshould include CIs for all estimates.\nTable 5: Same comments re: rounding to nearest .1 (phi coefficient could be rounded to nearest .01), including CIs.  \nShould also indicate either in this table or a supplemental table, the sample size for all the demographic subsets for each \nscreening test.\nView Letter\n2 of 6 2/11/2019, 10:09 AM\n\nGeneral, lines 47-48: Need to indicate by stats testing the basis for \"best\" performance.  Also, since two screens were cited \nas being superior to the third, that would make them better, not best, unless there was a stats basis for ordering them \nfrom best, better and last.  The false negative estimate is redundant, since it is the complement of the sensitivity estimate, \nbut if it is cited, then why is not the false positive estimate also cited?  As a screening test, both are important and both \nhave consequences. The false positive rates for 4P's and SURP-P are each quite high (70-80% range), compared to ~ 20% \nfalse positive rate for the NIDA test.  Another useful metric for the three screening tests would be to state their overall \naccuracy (true positive + true negative)/(all test results), with CIs. It appears that the usual trade-off between specificity \nand sensitivity is more favorable to the NIDA screen.  \nThe NIDA screen actually has statistically better AUC and accuracy metrics than did either the 4P's or the SURP-P screens.  \nTrue, the NIDA screen had more false negatives, but far fewer false positives and generally had better discriminatory \nmetrics than did the other two tests.  Applied to the population tested, the NIDA did have higher false negative rates, but \nthe other tests had much worse false positive rates, so the net result depends on the trade-off desired from the screening \ntest.\nEDITOR COMMENTS:\n1. Thank you for your submission to Obstetrics & Gynecology. In addition to the comments from the reviewers above, you \nare being sent a notated PDF that contains the Editor’s specific comments.

If you cannot locate the file, contact \nRandi Zung and she will send it by email - rzung@greenjournal.org.***\n- Most readers won't know what these two specific tools are before reading your paper. As the precis is supposed to be the \n\"hook\" on the table of contents page that draws peopel who use the TOC to determine what papers to read, could you \nmake this more generic. Something like:by comparing results of three different tools to screen prenatal patients for drug \nabuse to biologic samples, two were found to have high screening characteristics. That's not perfect but do you see what \nI'm suggesting?\n- As I read the tables that describe the different screening tools, it seems that they screen for different things.\n- how can a screening tool have diagnostic validity? \"Screener\" sounds like a person. Would you consider substituting \n\"Screening test or screening tool\"?\n- how were patients selected?\n- were they each given all 3? Have they been validated by phone? On the first administration, how were the given? When \nwere the biologic samples obtained with respect to the screening tools?\n- you don't provide all of these in the abstract. you do report the false negative rate, however.\n- congratulations to your study team. This is remarkable.\n- A false positive rate would also be important. It would be problematic to label a patient as a substance user if she is not. \nIn the manuscript, I hope you report this.\n- while assumed, I'm not sure this is known, and you didn't test that in this study.\n- ages 15-17 years. please add as appropriate throughout\n- ACOG is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n- as you've noted 2/3 are validated already. Could you explicate what you mean here by validation?\n- STARD guidelines ask you to clarify in methods if data collection was planned before index testing (Propsective) or after \n(Retrospective). Please include this.\n- in abstract you say it was a convenience sample. Was it consecutive or convenience? How did you decide on 500?\n- was the order here also randomized?\n- could you provide a little introduction about how you chose these (see STARD 10A). It looks like 2 are for any drugs and \nView Letter\n3 of 6 2/11/2019, 10:09 AM\n\nSURP-P only for alcohol. Is that correct?\n- could you explain that it is a two part test first?\n- is this on the Quick Screen or the Assist that response on 2-7 are summed?\n- are these NIDA's classifications or yours? If yours, how did you decide this? When did you\ndecide this?\n- how so if hair is for long term use? please be clear about ability of biologic samples to screen for EtOH\n- spell out\n- Please discuss here why you chose these outcomes as opposed to pos and neg predictive values (or including those). in \nyour abstract you also report the false negative rate--if not a primary outcome, perhaps shouldn't be in abstract. As one \nreviewer noted, you have a fairly high rate of substance abuse in your clinic. Sensitivity and Specificity are important or \ncourse and should be independent of prevalence. For others who. might want to consider using these tools, a reporting of \npredictive values in your setting could help them in assessing in their own populations after implementation what the rates \nare.\n- Based on STARD, please add discussion of 12 ab, 13 ab.\n- You don't mention PPV and NPV on lines 162-164.\n- were results of biological tests provided to the patients?\n- Per STARD, any adverse events?\n- This is called a primacy claim (your paper is the first or biggest) and must either be deleted or supported by providing \nthe search terms used, dates, and data bases searched (Medline, Ovid, Pubmed, Google Scholar, etc) in order to \nsubstantiate your claim.\n- Please include a more thorough comparison of the 3 screening tools in your manuscript. As I read what you've provided \nhere and think about the differences the 4P's plus there is no question about illegal drugs (other than cannibas, not illegal \neverywhere). The ASSIT tool is more thorough (but tested poorly). The SURP tool only asks specifically about marijuana \nand Alcohol and the 3rd tool is very general.\n- is this based on the screening test results only or on the biologic testing?\n2.

We were encouraged by the reviewers’ recognition of the importance of our \nwork and appreciated the detailed feedback offered for improving upon our original \nmanuscript. We have addressed the reviewers’ and editors’ concerns point-by-point. \n \nReviewer #1\n: \n“In terms of disclosures, since the primary author lists a corporation, there should be some \ndisclosure about how or if that employment impacts upon or relates to the study.” \n \nDr. Coleman-Cowger is employed by and receives a salary from The Emmes Corporation. \nHowever, this employment does not impact upon or relate to the study, which is funded by a \ngrant from NIDA. The grant was originally awarded and data collection was completed while Dr. \nColeman-Cowger was at Battelle. \n \n“Abstract: well written overall.  I would use one sentence in the objectives to tell us why the \nscreens are needed (rather than just doing universal testing?)” \n \nThank you for this comment. We agree that it is important for readers to understand the \ndifference between screening tools and biologic testing and have added a sentence to the \nObjectives. We have also added the following information to the introduction on lines 86-87: \n“Although many providers use biologic testing to determine use, a positive urine toxicology does \nnot provide any context regarding temporality of use or indications of problematic use.” \n \n“Introduction: lines 81-3, while they say that screening should be universal, I assumed this to \nmean urine or blood screen. What advantage do you see to a questionnaire screen? In other \nwords, make the case as to what this type of screening will add to prenatal care.” \n \nWe agree with your statement and thank you for this feedback. The following statement has \nbeen added to lines 86-87 in the introduction: “Although many providers use biologic testing to \ndetermine use, a positive urine toxicology does not provide any context regarding temporality of \nuse or indications of problematic use.” \n \n \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 2 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \n“Methods: you do a really nice job of describing your methods and process.” \n \nThank you. \n \n“Results: you do not need to re-describe values in tables 4 and 5 in the text.” \n \nWe have edited the text in the Results section so as not to re-state the values from tables 4 and \n5 in the text, except for race differences which we felt was clearer to keep in text. \n \n“Discussion: Again, I am still not convinced that you have made the case for me for using these \nscreens rather than doing routine urine screens.  Patients with problematic drug use will likely \nbe actively using through pregnancy and will be positive.  If someone used cannabis but \nstopped upon discovering the pregnancy, it seems that this may not be relevant.” \n \nThe following sentence was added to lines 259-262: “Urine tests, although relatively easy to \nobtain, are subject to variable excretion rates meaning that a negative toxicology test does not \nnecessarily preclude recent use, particularly for those drugs with a short half-life. Although hair \nsampling tests for a longer duration of exposure, its collection is more arduous and not likely to \nbe employed in most obstetric practices.” We have also added the following sentence to lines \n290-292: “Although screening with biologic tests such as urine toxicology have utility for \nconfirmatory testing, screening questionnaires are low cost, non-invasive and allow self-report \nof use, which may provide context and assist in the building of a trusting doctor-patient \nrelationship which is essential in the treatment of substance use disorders.”   \n \nReviewer #2\n: \n“I'd recommend using the term substance use disorder and avoiding pejorative terms whenever \npossible.” \n \nIn this manuscript, we utilize the terminology “illicit drug use” and “prescription drug misuse” to \nalign with that used by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, but otherwise use \n“substance use” throughout. We do not use “substance use disorder” as the screening tools are \nnot diagnostic and are screening for substance use only.  \n \n“Line 138. It should be noted whether the decision to consider moderate and high risk as \npositive screens was made a priori or post hoc. The former would be more rigorous, the latter \nmore susceptible to bias.” \n \nWe have noted in the manuscript that this was an a priori decision. \n \n“Line 153ff. The choice of urine and hair tests as the gold standard here has strengths and \nweaknesses. Each has sensitivity issues, for example. These should be noted in more detail in \nthe discussion. Further, neither are useful for picking up alcohol and indeed no alcohol is \nreported as detected here (Table 3). The screens, however, include alcohol, which would \nimpact the measures of merit. This should be noted in the manuscript and very likely suggests \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 3 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \nthat a different screener should be used for alcohol use during pregnancy -- VERY IMPORTANT \nGIVEN THE MULTIPLE DOCUMENTED ANATOMIC AND NEURODEVELOPMENTS BEHAVIORAL \nABNORMALITIES REPROTED WITH FETAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE.” \n \nWe have addressed the strengths and weaknesses of biologic testing in the Discussion. Drug \ntesting with hair and urine samples have limitations in that urine and hair testing can produce \nfalse positives and cannot tell timing or dosage of substance use. Hair sample testing does not \ninclude benzodiazepines, barbiturates or tricyclic antidepressants, additionally, hair samples \nallow for detecting substance use for up to 90 days after last use compared to 5-14 days for \nurine. It is in recognition of these individual limitations that we used a combination of the two, \nallowing for detection of recent substance use, and up to 90 days afterwards. We could not \ndetermine from this study the accuracy of the selected screeners in detecting prenatal alcohol \nuse, as ethanol was not measured via biologic testing. The purpose of this study was specific to \nillicit and prescription drugs and no conclusions can be drawn about the accuracy of the \nscreening tools for alcohol. \n \n“Line 165.The power analysis is under-described. It would be sensitive to the anticipated \nprevalence of positive and negative outcome measures. I don't understand the statements re \nfalse negative -- surely not a standard way of determining sample size or at least of reporting on \nit.” \n \nWe have addressed this and expanded the description of the sample size calculations. \n \n“Line 181. The test-retest reliability is probably overestimated, given learning effects with data \nbeing re-collected so close together and perhaps patients wanting to please the research staff \n(social desirability); this might be noted in the manuscript.” \n \nWe have addressed this concern by expanding our discussion. \n \n“Line 215ff. The specificity by race differences need some discussion later in the paper. It's not \nclear to me why these should have occurred.” \n \nWe speak more to the observed race differences in the Discussion, noting that these may be due \nto differences in substance use by subgroup and differences in the screening tools and how they \nassess substance use. \n \n“Line 263. The non-relevance of these findings re alcohol screening in pregnancy should be \nincluded here.” \n \nWe acknowledge in the Discussion that this study did not focus on alcohol screening. \n \n“Line 280. Universal screening is not supported by the findings in this study -- no evidence for \nenhancing outcomes or reducing costs, especially when you've mentioned negatives like \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 4 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \nincarceration above. The results would support the use of the two screeners for illicit drugs in \npregnancy.” \n \nThank you for this comment. We have removed this line from the discussion/conclusions.  \n \nReviewer #3\n: \n“Line 47 - It is probably unnecessary to give the sample size in the precis.” \n \nWe have removed the sample size from the precis. \n \n“Line 166 - The author's description of the sample size calculation should be more detailed.  The \nauthors previously published (BMJ Open. 2018 Feb 17;8(2): e020248 PMID 29455170) this \ndescription.” \n \nWe have expanded the description of the sample size calculations. \n \n“The overall study design is appropriate with the following limitations: 1) Two of the three \nsurvey instruments have been studied in pregnancy.  Not surprising they performed better. 2) \nThe applaud the efforts to obtain biological specimens. The trade-off is that the sample may not \nreflect the general population.  Interestingly, biological data and patient self-reporting are \nreasonably correlated.” \n \nWe have added these limitations to the Discussion section.  \n \n“Table 1 - Do the authors have permission to publish 4P's PLUS questionnaire?  It is my \nunderstanding that this is proprietary.” \n \nWe have removed reference to the specific questions from the 4P’s Plus and stated copyright \nlimitations in the footnotes. \n \n“Table 3 - This prevalence data could be presented better with a bar graph.” \n \nWe appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have removed Table 3. We now present the data \nfrom that table in a bar graph (Figure 2). \n \nStatistical Editor\n: \n“Table 3: Need to include CIs for all the prevalence estimates. Footnote should be added \nclarifying how a (+) was established: by examination of either hair or urine, or by requiring both \n(Table 4 implies that the results were slightly different.  If substantially different, should add a \nsupplemental table showing various criteria for (+) prevalence.” \n \nWe have addressed this in the manuscript. \n \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 5 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \n“Table 4: The NPV and PPV estimates do not apply to other populations with different \nprevalence rates of (+) substance.  A better metric would be LR(+) and LR(-).  Also, given the \nsample sizes, should round values to nearest .1, not.01 and should include CIs for all estimates.” \n \nWe have included confidence intervals and corrected the decimal places. \n \n“Table 5: Same comments re: rounding to nearest .1 (phi coefficient could be rounded to \nnearest .01), including CIs.  Should also indicate either in this table or a supplemental table, the \nsample size for all the demographic subsets for each screening test.” \n \nWe have addressed this in the manuscript. \n \n“General, lines 47-48: Need to indicate by stats testing the basis for \"best\" performance.  Also, \nsince two screens were cited as being superior to the third, that would make them better, not \nbest, unless there was a stats basis for ordering them from best, better and last.  The false \nnegative estimate is redundant, since it is the complement of the sensitivity estimate, but if it is \ncited, then why is not the false positive estimate also cited?  As a screening test, both are \nimportant and both have consequences. The false positive rates for 4P's and SURP-P are each \nquite high (70-80% range), compared to ~ 20% false positive rate for the NIDA test.  Another \nuseful metric for the three screening tests would be to state their overall accuracy (true positive \n+ true negative)/(all test results), with CIs. It appears that the usual trade-off between \nspecificity and sensitivity is more favorable to the NIDA screen.”   \n \nWe have removed reference to “better” or “best” as we include all the indices for the reader to \nmake an informed judgment about each screening tool’s usefulness. \n \n“The NIDA screen actually has statistically better AUC and accuracy metrics than did either the \n4P's or the SURP-P screens.  True, the NIDA screen had more false negatives, but far fewer false \npositives and generally had better discriminatory metrics than did the other two tests.  Applied \nto the population tested, the NIDA did have higher false negative rates, but the other tests had \nmuch worse false positive rates, so the net result depends on the trade-off desired from the \nscreening test.” \n \nWe agree and leave the trade-off decisions up to the reader. \n \nEditor\n: \n“Most readers won't know what these two specific tools are before reading your paper. As the \nprecis is supposed to be the \"hook\" on the table of contents page that draws people who use \nthe TOC to determine what papers to read, could you make this more generic…”  \n \nWe have edited the precis to be less specific and capture a reader’s attention. \n \n“As I read the tables that describe the different screening tools, it seems that they screen for \ndifferent things.” \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 6 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \n \nWe have included a more thorough comparison of the 3 screening tools, and what they screen \nfor, in the Discussion section. \n \n“how can a screening tool have diagnostic validity?”  \n \nWe have changed the wording for clarity to simply note “validity.” Given that we are examining \nthe accuracy of screening tools in identifying substance use rather than a diagnosis of substance \nuse disorder, we recognize that the terminology diagnostic validity could be confusing. We also \nstate in the discussion that a positive screen is not intended to be diagnostic. \n \n\"Screener\" sounds like a person. Would you consider substituting \"Screening test or screening \ntool\"? \n \nWe have edited the text throughout to “screening tool” instead of “screener.” \n \n“how were patients selected?” \n \nPatient selection is detailed in the materials and methods section of the paper; however, the \nabstract has been corrected to state the sample as “consecutive” rather than “convenience.” \n \n“were they each given all 3? Have they been validated by phone? On the first administration, \nhow were the given? When were the biologic samples obtained with respect to the screening \ntools?” \n \nEach participant was given all 3 screening tools in a randomized order. The tools have not been \nvalidated for telephone administration, and this is now noted in the text, along with answers to \neach of the editor’s subsequent questions. \n \n“you don't provide all of these in the abstract. you do report the false negative rate, however.” \n \nWe generally agree with the reviewer’s sentiments on this. As such, we have stuck to reporting \nonly sensitivity and specificity in the abstract. We have also taken out false negative rates, since \nthese are really just the inverse of sensitivity. \n \n“A false positive rate would also be important. It would be problematic to label a patient as a \nsubstance user if she is not. In the manuscript, I hope you report this.” \n \nThank you for this comment. We completely agree. We feel that this issue was addressed in the \nparagraph in the discussion that begins “The high false positive rate needs to be taken into \naccount when recommending these screeners…” \n \n“while assumed, I'm not sure this is known, and you didn't test that in this study.” \n \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 7 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \nWe have removed this part of the sentence from the abstract. \n \n“ages 15-17 years. please add as appropriate throughout” \n \nWe have now added “years” throughout.  \n \n“ACOG is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.” \n \nThis correction has been made. \n \n“as you've noted 2/3 are validated already. Could you explicate what you mean here by \nvalidation?” \n \nValidation here refers to validation by hair and urine biologic testing confirmation. Previously \nvalidated studies were done by interviews or urine only. \n \n“STARD guidelines ask you to clarify in methods if data collection was planned before index \ntesting (Prospective) or after (Retrospective). Please include this.” \n \nWe now state that data collection was prospective. \n \n“in abstract you say it was a convenience sample. Was it consecutive or convenience? How did \nyou decide on 500?” \n \nIt was consecutive. This has been corrected in the abstract. Our sample of 500 was decided upon \nprior to study start and was based on preliminary clinic data and power calculations. \n \n“was the order here also randomized?” \n \nYes, the order of index tests was randomized in the follow-up as well. We have added this \ninformation to the manuscript. \n \n“could you provide a little introduction about how you chose these (see STARD 10A). It looks \nlike 2 are for any drugs and SURP-P only for alcohol. Is that correct?” \n \nIntroductory text has been added to the Index Tests section to clarify how the three screening \ntools were chosen. All are intended to be screening tools for substance use, including the SURP-P \n(though the questions only inquire about alcohol and marijuana use).  \n \n“could you explain that it is a two part test first?” \n \nWe have added a sentence explaining that this is a two-part screening tool. \n \n“is this on the Quick Screen or the Assist that response on 2-7 are summed?” \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 8 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \n \nThe ASSIST contains items 2-7. We have modified the wording to make this more clear in the \ntext. \n \n“are these NIDA's classifications or yours? If yours, how did you decide this? When did you \ndecide this?” \n \nThese are NIDA’s classifications. \n \n“how so if hair is for long term use? please be clear about ability of biologic samples to screen \nfor EtOH” \n \nThe text was missing the word “less” so that it read incorrectly. It has been corrected. We are \nnow clear in our Limitations section that alcohol use was not biochemically verified as our tests \ndid not measure EtOH. \n \n“spell out” \n \nWe have edited to spell out electronic health records. \n \n“Please discuss here why you chose these outcomes as opposed to pos and neg predictive \nvalues (or including those). in your abstract you also report the false negative rate--if not a \nprimary outcome, perhaps shouldn't be in abstract. As one reviewer noted, you have a fairly \nhigh rate of substance abuse in your clinic. Sensitivity and Specificity are important or course \nand should be independent of prevalence. For others who. might want to consider using these \ntools, a reporting of predictive values in your setting could help them in assessing in their own \npopulations after implementation what the rates are.” \n \n“Based on STARD, please add discussion of 12 ab, 13 ab.” \n \nThis has been addressed within the manuscript. \n \n“You don't mention PPV and NPV on lines 162-164.” \n \nWe have added NPV and PPV to this paragraph. We thank the reviewer for this comment.  \n \n“were results of biological tests provided to the patients?” \n \nResults of urine tests were provided to patients at the in-person baseline visit; results of hair \ntests were provided by phone within 48 hours of receipt by research staff. We now include this \nin the Procedure and Test Methods section. \n \n“Per STARD, any adverse events?” \n \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 9 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \nThere were no adverse events and we now state this in the Ethical Considerations section of the \ntext. \n \n“This is called a primacy claim (your paper is the first or biggest) and must either be deleted or \nsupported by providing the search terms used, dates, and data bases searched (Medline, Ovid, \nPubmed, Google Scholar, etc) in order to substantiate your claim.” \n \nWe have deleted the primacy claim, and revised language to show that our study is an \nadvancement from prior studies that did not utilize both hair and urine testing.  \n \n“Please include a more thorough comparison of the 3 screening tools in your manuscript. As I \nread what you've provided here and think about the differences the 4P's plus there is no \nquestion about illegal drugs (other than cannabis, not illegal everywhere). The ASSIST tool is \nmore thorough (but tested poorly). The SURP tool only asks specifically about marijuana and \nAlcohol and the 3rd tool is very general.” \n \nWe have included a more thorough comparison of the 3 screening tools in the Discussion \nsection.  \n \n“is this based on the screening test results only or on the biologic testing?” \n \n“The word limits for different article types are as follows: Original Research articles, 300 words. \nPlease provide a word count.” \n \nWe have included a word count immediately following our abstract (296 words). \n \n“The journal does not use the virgule symbol (/) in sentences with words. Please rephrase your \ntext to avoid using \"and/or,\" or similar constructions throughout the text. You may retain this \nsymbol if you are using it to express data or a measurement.” \n \nWe have edited the body of the manuscript to remove the virgule symbol. \n \n“Line 246: We discourage claims of first reports since they are often difficult to prove. How do \nyou know this is the first report? If this is based on a systematic search of the literature, that \nsearch should be described in the text (search engine, search terms, date range of search, and \nlanguages encompassed by the search). If on the other hand, it is not based on a systematic \nsearch but only on your level of awareness, it is not a claim we permit.” \n \nWe have deleted the primacy claim, and revised language to show that our study is an \nadvancement from prior studies that did not utilize both hair and urine testing. \n \n“Please review the journal's Table Checklist to make sure that your tables conform to journal \nstyle. The Table Checklist is available online here: \nhttp://edmgr.ovid.com/ong/accounts/table_checklist.pdf\n.” \nGreen Journal Cover Letter Page 10 \nFebruary 7, 2019 \n \n \n \nWe have reviewed the Table Checklist and have modified Table 4 given the guidance listed \nabout not having different headings mid-title. \n \n“The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) documents are frequently \nupdated. These documents may be withdrawn and replaced with newer, revised versions. If \nyou cite ACOG documents in your manuscript, be sure the reference you are citing is still \ncurrent and available. If the reference you are citing has been updated (ie, replaced by a newer \nversion), please ensure that the new version supports whatever statement you are making in \nyour manuscript and then update your reference list accordingly (exceptions could include \nmanuscripts that address items of historical interest)...” \n \nWe have checked all ACOG documents cited to ensure that the most up-to-date versions are \nreferenced. \n \n“Figure 1: Please upload as a separate figure file on Editorial Manager. Additionally, were the 6 \nwith incomplete or missing index tests not excluded (500–6–47 does not equal 453).” \n \nWe have uploaded Figure 1 as a separate file. The six participants with incomplete or missing \nindex tests were not necessarily excluded from the study if they completed follow-up index tests. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThank you again for the opportunity to address reviewer concerns and strengthen our \nmanuscript.

Before a final decision can be made, we need\nyou to address the following queries. Please make the requested changes to the latest version of your\nmanuscript that is attached to this email. \nPlease track your changes and leave the ones made by the\nEditorial Office. Please also note your responses to the author queries in your email message back to\nme.\n1. General: The Editor has made edits to the manuscript using track changes. Please review them to\nmake sure they are correct.\nI have reviewed all changes and they are correct, with the exception of one that I rejected related to\nquery 11. Thank you.\n2. Title: Do you agree with the edited title?\n \nI modified it slightly to say “use” and not “abuse” but otherwise I agree with the edits.\n3. Kathleen E. Trocin will need to complete our electronic Copyright Transfer Agreement, which was\nsent to her through Editorial Manager\nMs. Trocin has completed the electronic Copyright Transfer Agreement.\n4. Abstract-Objective: The objective for the abstract should be a simple \"to\" statement without\nbackground. The second sentence listed here is not needed.\nOkay. I agree with edits made.\n5. Starting at Line 63 and elsewhere: Please remove the use of the word “screener” and replace\nthroughout with “screening test”.\n We had changed many references of screener to screening tool in the prior revision but missed\nseveral. We have made the change here and did a search and replace for all other reference to\n“screeners.”\n6. Line 67: Table 3 says 84.5. Which is correct?\n \nThe number in the table is correct (84.5) and we have corrected the abstract to reflect this.\n7. Line 112: Please clarify. I have a hard time believing that every woman approached was enrolled for a\ntotal of 500.\n \n The # of enrolled belongs in the results section.\n \n There, please tell us how many\nconsecutive patients were approached and how many agreed. Please edit this statement like you have\nit in the first paragraph of the Results.\n\n We have modified this sentence for clarity and removed number of enrolled participants from this\nsection. The number of approached and enrolled participants is reported in Results.\n8. Line 138: By “screened positive” here does that include only the questionnaire screening tests or\ndoes it also include the biologic testing?  I ask because right before this sentence you are describing\nhandling of the biological testing results.\n \nIt includes both. I have added additional clarifying information to this sentence.\n9. Line 167: 2 or 3 affirmative responses don’t “yield a HR individual”.  2 or 3 affirmative responses\nmight result in someone being considered to be at high risk.  Same is true for the “yielded a low-risk\nindividual” above. \n \nWe appreciate the suggestion to change this language, and we have modified this sentence.\n10. Line 203: This might be clearer, if I understand the meaning correctly if you said “If results between\nany pair of surveys disagreed for at least 15% of study participants,…”.\n \nWe have changed wording as suggested for clarity.\n11. Line 277: I’m a bit confused here. Have copied what you said above about the SURP-P study.   There\nyou indicated that  “2 or 3 affirmative responses yielded a high risk individual for substance use, not just\nalcohol and marijuana.” You reiterate here that it screens only for MJ and EtOH. So how can you say it\nidentifies people at high risk for use of other drugs? Based on what? Also, the tests.\nThe SURP-P is intended to be a screening tool for all prenatal substance use, though it only inquires\nabout alcohol and marijuana use. The questions asked are about ever-use of marijuana and alcohol use\nin the month prior to pregnancy, as the idea is that women may not be as forthcoming about substance\nuse during pregnancy if asked directly. These questions serve as a proxy for current substance use.\nHere’s the article about the development of the SURP-P:\nYonkers KA, Gotman N, Kershaw T, Forray A,\nHowell HB, Rounsaville BJ. Screening for prenatal substance use: development of the Substance Use Risk\nProfile-Pregnancy scale. Obstetrics and gynecology. 2010 Oct;116(4):827.\n12. Line 285: I always have trouble with this as I know what you mean, but it’s not technically correct. \nNeither alcohol, nor marijuana in many states, are “illicit” which generally means forbidden by law or\nrule.\n \nWe have removed “illicit” here.\nTo facilitate the review process, we would appreciate receiving a response within 48 hours.\n \nBest,\nRandi Zung\n \n_ _\nRandi Zung (Ms.)\nEditorial Administrator | Obstetrics & Gynecology\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n409 12th Street, SW\nWashington, DC 20024-2188\nT: 202-314-2341 | F: 202-479-0830\nhttp://www.greenjournal.org\n \n \nFrom:\nTo: Eileen Chang (Temp)\nSubject: Re: O&G Figure Revision 18-2286\nDate: Thursday, February 28, 2019 6:30:14 AM\nDear Eileen,\nApologies for my delay in getting back to you. I have been out of town all week and am just\nreturning. The figures you sent look fine and the v3 of Figure 2 improves upon the original, so\nplease move forward with that one.\nThank you,\nVictoria\n \nOn Mon, Feb 25, 2019 at 2:01 PM Eileen Chang (Temp) <echang@greenjournal.org> wrote:\nGood Afternoon,\n \nYour figures have been edited, and PDFs of the figures and legend are attached for your\nreview. Please review the figures and legend CAREFULLY for any mistakes.\n \nPLEASE NOTE: Any changes to the figures must be made now.

We think either version of the figure could work – we would\nlike to leave it up to you to decide what you think works best for your manuscript.\n \nTo avoid a delay, I would appreciate a reply no later than Wednesday, 2/27. Thank you for\nyour help!\n \nBest,\nEileen\n"
