  "abstract": "Machine learning has been increasingly utilized in the field of protein engineering, and research directed at predicting the effects of protein mutations has attracted increasing attention. Among them, so far, the best results have been achieved by related methods based on protein language models, which are trained on a large number of unlabeled protein sequences to capture the generally hidden evolutionary rules in protein sequences, and are therefore able to predict their fitness from protein sequences. Although numerous similar models and methods have been successfully employed in practical protein engineering processes, the majority of the studies have been limited to how to construct more complex language models to capture richer protein sequence feature information and utilize this feature information for unsupervised protein fitness prediction. There remains considerable untapped potential in these developed models, such as whether the prediction performance can be further improved by integrating different models to further improve the accuracy of prediction. Furthermore, how to utilize large-scale models for prediction methods of mutational effects on quantifiable properties of proteins due to the nonlinear relationship between protein fitness and the quantification of specific functionalities has yet to be explored thoroughly. In this study, we propose an ensemble learning approach for predicting mutational effects of proteins integrating protein sequence features extracted from multiple large protein language models, as well as evolutionarily coupled features extracted in homologous sequences, while comparing the differences between linear regression and deep learning models in mapping these features to quantifiable functional changes. We tested our approach on a dataset of 17 protein deep mutation scans and indicated that the integrated approach together with linear regression enables the models to have higher prediction accuracy and generalization. Moreover, we further illustrated the reliability of the integrated approach by exploring the differences in the predictive performance of the models across species and protein sequence lengths, as well as by visualizing clustering of ensemble and non-ensemble features.",
