However, the large model\nsizes, together with the long inference time,\nlimit the deployment of such models in real-\ntime applications. One line of model com-\npression approaches considers knowledge dis-\ntillation to distill large teacher models into\nsmall student models. Most of these stud-\nies focus on single-domain only, which ig-\nnores the transferable knowledge from other\ndomains. We notice that training a teacher\nwith transferable knowledge digested across\ndomains can achieve better generalization ca-\npability to help knowledge distillation. Hence\nwe propose a Meta-Knowledge Distillation\n(Meta-KD) framework to build a meta-teacher\nmodel that captures transferable knowledge\nacross domains and passes such knowledge\nto students. Speciﬁcally, we explicitly force\nthe meta-teacher to capture transferable knowl-\nedge at both instance-level and feature-level\nfrom multiple domains, and then propose\na meta-distillation algorithm to learn single-\ndomain student models with guidance from the\nmeta-teacher. Experiments on public multi-\ndomain NLP tasks show the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of the proposed Meta-KD frame-\nwork. Further, we also demonstrate the capa-\nbility of Meta-KD in the settings where the\ntraining data is scarce.\n1 Introduction\nPre-trained Language Models (PLM) such as\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and XLNet (Yang et al.,\n2019) have achieved signiﬁcant success with the\ntwo-stage “pre-training and ﬁne-tuning” process.\nDespite the performance gain achieved in various\nNLP tasks, the large number of model parameters\n∗H. Pan and C. Wang contributed equally to this work.\n†M. Qiu is the corresponding author.\n(a) Learning from an in-domain teacher.\n(b) Learning from multiple teachers of varied domains.\n(c) Learning from meta-teacher with multi-domain knowledge.\nPhysicsTeacher\nPhysicsTeacherPhysicsEquationPhysicsStudentMathTeacher\nPhysicsEquationAll-purposeTeacher\nPhysicsEquationPhysicsStudent\nPhysicsStudent\nFigure 1: A motivation example of academic learning.\nA physics student may learn physics equations better\nwith a powerful all-purpose teacher.\nand the long inference time have become the bot-\ntleneck for PLMs to be deployed in real-time ap-\nplications, especially on mobile devices (Jiao et al.,\n2019; Sun et al., 2020; Iandola et al., 2020). Thus,\nthere are increasing needs for PLMs to reduce the\nmodel size and the computational overhead while\nkeeping the prediction accuracy.\nKnowledge Distillation (KD) (Hinton et al.,\n2015) is one of the promising ways to distill the\nknowledge from a large “teacher” model to a small\n“student” model. Recent studies show that KD can\nbe applied to compress PLMs with acceptable per-\nformance loss (Sanh et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019b;\nJiao et al., 2019; Turc et al., 2019; Chen et al.,\n2020a). However, those methods mainly focus\non single-domain KD. Hence, student models can\nonly learn from their in-domain teachers, paying\nlittle attention to acquiring knowledge from other\ndomains. It has been shown that it is beneﬁcial\nto consider cross-domain information for KD, by\neither training a teacher using cross-domain data\nor multiple teachers from multiple domains (You\net al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020;\n3027\nPeng et al., 2020). Consider an academic scenario\nin Figure 1. A typical way for a physics student\nto learn physics equations is to directly learn from\nhis/her physics teacher. If we have a math teacher\nto teach him/her basic knowledge of equations, the\nstudent can obtain a better understanding of physics\nequations. This “knowledge transfer” technique in\nKD has been proved efﬁcient only when two do-\nmains are close to each other (Hu et al., 2019). In\nreality, however, it is highly risky as teachers of\nother domains may pass non-transferable knowl-\nedge to the student model, which is irrelevant to\nthe current domain and hence harms the overall\nperformance (Tan et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020).\nBesides, current studies ﬁnd multi-task ﬁne-tuning\nof BERT does not necessarily yield better perfor-\nmance across all the tasks (Sun et al., 2019a).\nTo address these issues, we leverage the idea of\nmeta-learning to capture transferable knowledge\nacross domains, as recent studies have shown that\nmeta-learning can improve the model generaliza-\ntion ability across domains (Finn et al., 2017; Javed\nand White, 2019; Yin, 2020; Ye et al., 2020). We\nfurther notice that meta-knowledge is also help-\nful for cross-domain KD. Re-consider the example\nin Figure 1. If we have an “all-purpose teacher”\n(i.e., the meta-teacher) who has the knowledge of\nboth physics principles and mathematical equations\n(i.e., the general knowledge of the two courses), the\nstudent may learn physics equations better with the\nteacher, compared to the other two cases. Hence, it\nis necessary to train an “all-purpose teacher” model\nfor domain-speciﬁc student models to learn.\nIn this paper, we propose the Meta-Knowledge\nDistillation (Meta-KD) framework, which facili-\nties cross-domain KD. Generally speaking, Meta-\nKD consists of two parts, meta-teacher learning\nand meta-distillation. Different from the K-way\nN-shot problems addressed in traditional meta-\nlearning (Vanschoren, 2018), we propose to train\na “meta-learner” as the meta-teacher, which learns\nthe transferable knowledge across domains so that\nit can ﬁt new domains easily. The meta-teacher\nis jointly trained with multi-domain datasets to\nacquire the instance-level and feature-level meta-\nknowledge. For each domain, the student model\nlearns to solve the task over a domain-speciﬁc\ndataset with guidance from the meta-teacher. To\nimprove the student’s distillation ability, the meta-\ndistillation module minimizes the distillation loss\nfrom both intermediate layers, output layers, and\ntransferable knowledge, combined with domain-\nexpertise weighting techniques.\nTo verify the effectiveness of Meta-KD, we\nconduct extensive experiments on two NLP tasks\nacross multiple domains, namely natural language\ninference (Williams et al., 2018) and sentiment\nanalysis (Blitzer et al., 2007). Experimental re-\nsults show the effectiveness and superiority of the\nproposed Meta-KD framework. Moreover, we ﬁnd\nour method performs well especially when i) the\nin-domain dataset is very small or ii) there is no\nin-domain dataset during the training of the meta-\nteacher. In summary, the contributions of this study\ncan be concluded as follows:\n• To the best of our knowledge, this work is the\nﬁrst to explore the idea of meta-teacher learn-\ning for PLM compression across domains.\n• We propose the Meta-KD framework to ad-\ndress the task. In Meta-KD, the meta-teacher\ndigests transferable knowledge across do-\nmains, and selectively passes the knowledge\nto student models with different domain ex-\npertise degrees.\n• We conduct extensive experiments to demon-\nstrate the superiority of Meta-KD and also\nexplore the capability of this framework in the\nsettings where the training data is scarce.\nThe rest of this paper is summarized as follows.\nSection 2 describes the related work. The detailed\ntechniques of the Meta-KD framework are pre-\nsented in Section 3. The experiments are reported\nin Section 4. Finally, we conclude our work and\ndiscuss the future work in Section 5. 1\n2 Related Work\nOur study is close to the following three lines of\nstudies, introduced below.\n2.1 Knowledge Distillation (KD)\nKD was ﬁrst proposed by (Hinton et al., 2015), aim-\ning to transfer knowledge from an ensemble or a\nlarge model into a smaller, distilled model. Most of\nthe KD methods focus on utilizing either the dark\nknowledge, i.e., predicted outputs (Hinton et al.,\n2015; Chen et al., 2020b; Furlanello et al., 2018;\nYou et al., 2017) or hints, i.e., the intermediate\n1The experimental code can be found in https:\n//github.com/alibaba/EasyTransfer/tree/\nmaster/scripts/metaKD.\n3028\nrepresentations (Romero et al., 2015; Yim et al.,\n2017; You et al., 2017) or the relations between\nlayers (Yim et al., 2017; Tarvainen and Valpola,\n2017) of teacher models. You et al. (2017) also\nﬁnd that multiple teacher networks together can\nprovide comprehensive guidance that is beneﬁcial\nfor training the student network. Ruder et al. (2017)\nshow that multiple expert teachers can improve the\nperformances of sentiment analysis on unseen do-\nmains. Tan et al. (2019) apply the multiple-teachers\nframework in KD to build a state-of-the-art mul-\ntilingual machine translation system. Feng et al.\n(2021) considers to build a model to automatically\naugment data for KD. Our work is one of the ﬁrst\nattempts to learn a meta-teacher model that digest\ntransferable knowledge from multiple domains to\nbeneﬁt KD on the target domain.\n2.2 PLM Compression\nDue to the massive number of parameters in PLMs,\nit is highly necessary to compress PLMs for ap-\nplication deployment. Previous approaches on\ncompressing PLMs such as BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2019) include KD (Hinton et al., 2015), param-\neter sharing (Ullrich et al., 2017), pruning (Han\net al., 2015) and quantization (Gong et al., 2014).\nIn this work, we mainly focus on KD for PLMs.\nIn the literature, Tang et al. (2019) distill BERT\ninto BiLSTM networks to achieve comparable re-\nsults with ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). Chen\net al. (2021) studies cross-domain KD to facilitate\ncross-domain knowledge transferring. Zhao et al.\n(2019) use dual distillation to reduce the vocabulary\nsize and the embedding size. DistillBERT (Sanh\net al., 2019) applies KD loss in the pre-training\nstage, while BERT-PKD (Sun et al., 2019b) distill\nBERT into shallow Transformers in the ﬁne-tuning\nstage. TinyBERT (Jiao et al., 2019) further dis-\ntills BERT with a two-stage KD process for hidden\nattention matrices and embedding matrices. Ad-\naBERT (Chen et al., 2020a) uses neural architec-\nture search to adaptively ﬁnd small architectures.\nOur work improves the prediction accuracy of com-\npressed PLMs by leveraging cross-domain knowl-\nedge, which is complementary to previous works.\n2.3 Transfer Learning and Meta-learning\nTL has been proved to improve the performance on\nthe target domain by leveraging knowledge from\nrelated source domains (Pan and Yang, 2010; Mou\net al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). In\nmost NLP tasks, the “shared-private” architecture\nis applied to learn domain-speciﬁc representations\nand domain-invariant features (Mou et al., 2016;\nLiu et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018, 2019). Com-\npared to TL, the goal of meta-learning is to train\nmeta-learners that can adapt to a variety of different\ntasks with little training data (Vanschoren, 2018).\nA majority of meta-learning methods for include\nmetric-based (Snell et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2019),\nmodel-based (Santoro et al., 2016; Bartunov et al.,\n2020) and model-agnostic approaches (Finn et al.,\n2017, 2018; Vuorio et al., 2019). Meta-learning\ncan also be applied to KD in some computer vision\ntasks (Lopes et al., 2017; Jang et al., 2019; Liu\net al., 2020; Bai et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). For\nexample, Lopes et al. (2017) record per-layer meta-\ndata for the teacher model to reconstruct a training\nset, and then adopts a standard training procedure\nto obtain the student model. In our work, we use\ninstance-based and feature-based meta-knowledge\nacross domains for the KD process.\n3 The Meta-KD Framework\nIn this section, we formally introduce the Meta-\nKD framework. We begin with a brief overview of\nMeta-KD. After that, the techniques are elaborated.\n3.1 An Overview of Meta-KD\nTake text classiﬁcation as an example. Assume\nthere are K training sets, corresponding to K do-\nmains. In the k-th dataset Dk = {X(i)\nk ,y(i)\nk }Nk\ni=1,\nX(i)\nk is the i-th sample 2 and y(i)\nk is the class label\nof X(i)\nk . Nk is the total number of samples in Dk.\nLet Mk be the large PLM ﬁne-tuned on Dk. Given\nthe K datasets, the goal of Meta-KD is to obtain\nthe Kstudent models S1,··· ,SK that are small in\nsize but has similar performance compared to the\nKlarge PLMs, i.e., M1,··· ,MK.\nIn general, the Meta-KD framework can be di-\nvided into the following two stages:\n• Meta-teacher Learning : Learn a meta-\nteacher Mover all domains\nK⋃\nk=1\nDk. The\nmodel digests transferable knowledge from\neach domain and has better generalization\nwhile supervising domain-speciﬁc students.\n• Meta-distillation: Learn K in-domain stu-\ndents S1,··· ,SK that perform well in their\n2X(i)\nk can be a sentence, a sentence pair or any other tex-\ntual units, depending on the task inputs.\n3029\nrespective domains, given only in-domain data\nDk and the meta-teacher Mas input.\nDuring the learning process of the meta-teacher,\nwe consider both instance-level and feature-level\ntransferable knowledge. Inspired by prototype-\nbased meta-learning (Snell et al., 2017; Pan et al.,\n2019), the meta-teacher model should memo-\nrize more information about prototypes. Hence,\nwe compute sample-wise prototype scores as\nthe instance-level transferable knowledge. The loss\nof the meta-teacher is deﬁned as the sum of classi-\nﬁcation loss across all Kdomains with prototype-\nbased, instance-speciﬁc weighting . Besides, it\nalso learns feature-level transferable knowledge by\nadding a domain-adversarial loss as an auxiliary\nloss. By these steps, the meta-teacher is more gen-\neralized and digests transferable knowledge before\nsupervising student models.\nFor meta-distillation, each sample is weighted\nby a domain-expertise score to address the meta-\nteacher’s capability for this sample. Thetransfer-\nable knowledge is also learned for the students from\nthe meta-teacher. The overall meta-distillation\nloss is a combination of the Mean Squared Er-\nror (MSE) loss from intermediate layers of both\nmodels (Sun et al., 2019b; Jiao et al., 2019), the\nsoft cross-entropy loss from output layers (Hinton\net al., 2015), and the transferable knowledge distil-\nlation loss, with instance-speciﬁc domain-expertise\nweighting applied.\n3.2 Meta-teacher Learning\nWe take BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) as our base\nlearner for text classiﬁcation due to its wide\npopularity. For each sample X(i)\nk , the input\nis: [CLS], tok(i)\nk,1, tok(i)\nk,2, ···, [SEP], where\ntok(i)\nk,n is the n-th token in X(i)\nk . The last\nhidden outputs of this sequence is denoted as\nh[CLS],h(tok(i)\nk,1),h(tok(i)\nk,2),..,h (tok(i)\nk,N), where\nh(tok(i)\nk,j) represents the last layer embedding of\nthe j-th token in X(i)\nk , and N is the maximum se-\nquence length. For simplicity, we deﬁne h(X(i)\nk )\nas the average pooling of the token embeddings,\ni.e., h(X(i)\nk ) =∑N\nn=1 h(tok(i)\nk,n).\nLearning Instance-level Transferable Knowl-\nedge. To select transferable instances across do-\nmains, we compute a prototype score t(i)\nk for each\nsample X(i)\nk . Here, we treat the prototype repre-\nsentation for the m-th class of the k-th domain:\np(m)\nk = 1\n|D(m)\nk |\n∑\nX(i)\nk ∈D(m)\nk\nh(X(i)\nk ), where D(m)\nk\nis the k-th training set with the m-th class label.\nThe prototype score t(i)\nk is:\nt(i)\nk =αcos(p(m)\nk ,h(X(i)\nk ))\n+ ζ\nK(k′̸=k)∑\nk′=1\ncos(p(m)\nk′ ,h(X(i)\nk )),\nwhere cos is the cosine similarity function, αis a\npre-deﬁned hyper-parameter and ζ = 1−α\nK−1. We\ncan see that the deﬁnition of the prototype score\nhere is different from previous meta-learning, as\nwe require that an instance X(i)\nk should be close\nto its class prototype representation in the embed-\nding space (i.e., p(m)\nk ), as well as the prototype rep-\nresentations in out-of-domain datasets (i.e., p(m)\nk′\nwith k′ = 1,··· ,K,k ′ ̸= k). This is because\nthe meta-teacher should learn more from instances\nthat are prototypical across domains instead of in-\ndomain only. For the text classiﬁcation task, the\ncross-entropy loss of the meta-teacher is deﬁned us-\ning the cross-entropy loss with the prototype score\nas a weight assigned to each instance.\nLearning Feature-level Transferable Knowl-\nedge. Apart from the cross-entropy loss, we pro-\npose the domain-adversarial loss to increase the\nmeta-teacher’s ability for learning feature-level\ntransferable knowledge.\nFor each sampleX(i)\nk , we ﬁrst learn an|h(X(i)\nk )|-\ndimensional domain embedding of the true domain\nlabel d(i)\nk by mapping one-hot domain representa-\ntions to the embeddings, denoted as ED(X(i)\nk ). A\nsub-network is then constructed by:\nhd(X(i)\nk )) = tanh((h(X(i)\nk ) +ED(X(i)\nk ))W + b),\nwhere W and bare sub-network parameters. The\ndomain-adversarial loss for X(i)\nk is deﬁned as:\nLDA(X(i)\nk ) =−\nK∑\nk=1\n1k=z(i)\nk\n·log σ(hd(X(i)\nk )),\nwhere σis the K-way domain classiﬁer, and 1 is\nthe indicator function that returns 1 ifk= z(i)\nk , and\n0 otherwise. Here, z(i)\nk ̸= d(i)\nk is a false domain la-\nbel of X(i)\nk\n3. Hence, we deliberately maximize the\nprobability that the meta-teacher makes the wrong\n3For ease of implementation, we shufﬂe the domain labels\nof all instances in a mini-batch.\n3030\nEmbeddingEncoderEncoder......Encoder...\nEmbeddingEncoderEncoder\n......ℒ!\"\nTransferrableKnowledgeTransferrableKnowledgeℒ#!\"\nDomain 1\nDomain 2\nClass 1 SampleClass 1 CentroidClass 2 SampleClass 2 Centroid\nPrototype Score 𝑡!(%)\nPredictedLabel #𝑦!(%)\nDomain-expertise Weight 𝜆!(%)\nInputInstance w.

The total loss of the\nmeta-teacher LMT is the combination of weighted\nLCE(X(i)\nk ) and LDA(X(i)\nk ), shown as follows:\nLMT =\n∑\nX(i)\nk ∈\nK⋃\nk=1\nDk\nt(i)\nk LCE(X(i)\nk ) +γ1LDA(X(i)\nk )\n∑K\nk=1 |Dk|\n,\nwhere γ1 is the factor to represent how the domain-\nadversarial loss contributes to the overall loss.\n3.3 Meta-distillation\nWe take BERT as our meta-teacher and use smaller\nBERT models as student models. The distillation\nframework is shown in Figure 2. In our work, we\ndistill the knowledge in the meta-teacher model\nconsidering the following ﬁve elements: input em-\nbeddings, hidden states, attention matrices, output\nlogits, and transferable knowledge. The KD pro-\ncess of input embeddings, hidden states and atten-\ntion matrices follows the common practice (Sun\net al., 2019b; Jiao et al., 2019). Recall that Mand\nSk are the meta-teacher and the k-th student model.\nLet Lembd(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ), Lhidn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) and\nLattn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) be the sample-wise MSE loss\nvalues of input embeddings, hidden states and at-\ntention matrices of the two models, respectively.\nHere, Lembd(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ), Lhidn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )\nand Lattn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) refer to the sum of MSE\nvalues among multiple hidden layers. We refer\ninterested readers to Jiao et al. (2019) for more\ndetails. Lpred(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) is the cross-entropy\nloss of “softened” output logits, parameterized by\nthe temperature (Hinton et al., 2015). A naive ap-\nproach to formulating the total KD loss Lkd is the\nsum of all previous loss functions, i.e.,\nLkd =\n∑\nX(i)\nk ∈Dk\n(\nLembd(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )+\nLhidn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) +Lattn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )+\nLpred(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )\n)\n.\nHowever, the above approach does not give spe-\ncial considerations to the transferable knowledge of\nthe meta-teacher. Let hM\nd (X(i)\nk ) and hS\nd(X(i)\nk ) be\nthe transferable knowledge of the meta-teacher and\nthe student model w.r.t. the input X(i)\nk . We further\ndeﬁne the transferable knowledge distillation loss\nLTKD(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) as follows:\nLtkd(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) =\n1\n|Dk|\n∑\nX(i)\nk ∈Dk\nMSE\n(\nhM\nd (X(i)\nk )WM\nd ,hS\nd(X(i)\nk )\n)\nwhere WM\nd is a learnable projection matrix to\nmatch the dimension between hM\nd (X(i)\nk ) and\nhS\nd(X(i)\nk ), and MSE is the MSE loss function w.r.t.\nsingle element. In this way, we encourage student\nmodels to learn more transferable knowledge from\nthe meta-teacher.\nWe further notice that although the knowledge\nof the meta-teacher should be highly transferable,\nthere still exists the domain gap between the meta-\nteacher and domain-speciﬁc student models. In this\n3031\nwork, for each sample X(i)\nk , we deﬁne the domain\nexpertise weight λ(i)\nk as follows:\nλ(i)\nk = 1 +t(i)\nk\nexp(ˆy(i)\nk −y(i)\nk )2\n+1\n,\nwhere ˆy(i)\nk is the predicted result of X(i)\nk ’s class\nlabel. Here, the weight λ(i)\nk is large when the meta-\nteacher model i) has a large prototype scoret(i)\nk and\nii) makes correct predictions on the target input, i.e.,\nˆy(i)\nk = y(i)\nk . We can see that the weight reﬂects how\nwell the meta-teacher can supervise the student on\na speciﬁc input. Finally, we derive the complete\nformulation of the KD loss L′\nkd as follows:\nL′\nkd =\n∑\nX(i)\nk ∈Dk\nλ(i)\nk\n(\nLembd(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )+\nLhidn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk ) +Lattn(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )+\nLpred(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )\n)\n+ γ2Ltkd(M,Sk,X(i)\nk )\n)\n,\nwhere γ2 is the transferable KD factor to represent\nhow the transferable knowledge distillation loss\ncontributes to the overall loss.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we conduct extensive experiments\nto evaluate the Meta-KD framework on two popular\ntext mining tasks across domains.\n4.1 Tasks and Datasets\nWe evaluate Meta-KD over natural language infer-\nence and sentiment analysis, using the following\ntwo datasets MNLI and Amazon Reviews. The\ndata statistics are in Table 1.\n• MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) is a large-\nscale, multi-domain natural language infer-\nence dataset for predicting the entailment re-\nlation between two sentences, containing ﬁve\ndomains (genres). After ﬁltering samples with\nno labels available, we use the original devel-\nopment set as our test set and randomly sam-\nple 10% of the training data as a development\nset in our setting.\n• Amazon Reviews (Blitzer et al., 2007) is\na multi-domain sentiment analysis dataset,\nwidely used in multi-domain text classiﬁca-\ntion tasks. The reviews are annotated as pos-\nitive or negative. For each domain, there are\n2,000 labeled reviews. We randomly split the\ndata into train, development, and test sets.\nDataset Domain #Train #Dev #Test\nMNLI\nFiction 69,613 7,735 1,973\nGov. 69,615 7,735 1,945\nSlate 69,575 7,731 1,955\nTelephone 75,013 8,335 1,966\nTravel 69,615 7,735 1,976\nBook 1,631 170 199\nAmazon DVD 1,621 194 185\nReviews Elec. 1,615 172 213\nKitchen 1,613 184 203\nTable 1: Statistics of the two datasets.\n4.2 Baselines\nFor the teacher side, to evaluate the cross-domain\ndistillation power of the meta-teacher model, we\nconsider the following models as baseline teachers:\n• BERT-single: Train the BERT teacher model\non the target distillation domain only. If we\nhave Kdomains, then we will have KBERT-\nsingle teachers.\n• BERT-mix: Train the BERT teacher on a\ncombination of K-domain datasets. Hence,\nwe have one BERT-mix model as the teacher\nmodel for all domains.\n• BERT-mtl: Similar to the “one-teacher”\nparadigm as in BERT-mix, but the teacher\nmodel is generated by the multi-task ﬁne-\ntuning approach (Sun et al., 2019a).\n• Multi-teachers: It uses K domain-speciﬁc\nBERT-single models to supervise K student\nmodels, ignoring the domain difference.\nFor the student side, we follow TinyBERT (Jiao\net al., 2019) to use smaller BERT models as our\nstudent models. In single-teacher baselines (i.e.,\nBERT-single, BERT-mix and BERT-mtl), we use\nTinyBERT-KD as our baseline KD approach. In\nmulti-teachers, because TinyBERT-KD does not\nnaturally support distilling from multiple teacher\nmodels, we implement a variant of the TinyBERT-\nKD process based on MTN-KD (You et al., 2017),\nwhich uses averaged softened outputs as the incor-\nporation of multiple teacher networks in the output\nlayer. In practice, we ﬁrst learn the representations\nof the student models by TinyBERT, then apply\nMTN-KD for output-layer KD.\n3032\nMethod Fiction Government Slate Telephone Travel Average\nBERTB-single 82.2 84.2 76.7 82.4 84.2 81.9\nBERTB-mix 84.8 87.2 80.5 83.8 85.5 84.4\nBERTB-mtl 83.7 87.1 80.6 83.9 85.8 84.2\nMeta-teacher 85.1 86.5 81.0 83.9 85.5 84.4\nBERTB-single\nTinyBERT-KD\n−−−−−−−−→BERTS 78.8 83.2 73.6 78.8 81.9 79.3\nBERTB-mix\nTinyBERT-KD\n−−−−−−−−→BERTS 79.6 83.3 74.8 79.0 81.5 79.6\nBERTB-mtl\nTinyBERT-KD\n−−−−−−−−→BERTS 79.7 83.1 74.2 79.3 82.0 79.7\nMulti-teachers MTN-KD−−−−−→BERTS 77.4 81.1 72.2 77.2 78.0 77.2\nMeta-teacher\nTinyBERT-KD\n−−−−−−−−→BERTS 80.3 83.0 75.1 80.2 81.6 80.0\nMeta-teacher Meta-distillation− −−−−−−−− →BERTS 80.5 83.7 75.0 80.5 82.1 80.4\nTable 2: Results over MNLI (with ﬁve domains) in terms of accuracy (%).

We train 3-4 epochs with the\nlearning rate to be 2e-5. The batch size and γ1\nare chosen from {16, 32, 48}and {0.1, 0.2, 0.5},\nrespectively. All the hyper-parameters are tuned on\nthe development sets.\n4https://github.com/huawei-noah/\nPretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/\nTinyBERT\nFor meta-distillation, we choose the hidden lay-\ners in {3, 6, 9, 12 }of the teacher models in the\nbaselines and the meta-teacher model in our ap-\nproach to learn the representations of the student\nmodels. Due to domain difference, we train stu-\ndent models in 3-10 epochs, with a learning rate\nof 5e-5. The batch size and γ2 are tuned from {32,\n256}and {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}for intermediate-\nlayer distillation, respectively. Following Jiao et al.\n(2019), for prediction-layer distillation, we run the\nmethod for 3 epochs, with the batch size and learn-\ning rate to be 32 and 3e-5. The experiments are\nimplemented on PyTorch and run on 8 Tsela V100\nGPUs.\n3033\n4.4 Experimental Results\nTable 2 and Table 3 show the general testing perfor-\nmance over MNLI and Amazon Reviews of base-\nlines and Meta-KD, in terms of accuracy. From the\nresults, we have the following three major insights:\n• Compared to all the baseline teacher models,\nusing the meta-teacher for KD consistently\nachieves the highest accuracy in both datasets.\nOur method can help to signiﬁcantly reduce\nmodel size while preserving similar perfor-\nmance, especially in Amazon review, we re-\nduce the model size to 7.5x smaller with only\na minor performance drop (from 89.9 to 89.4).\n• The meta-teacher has similar performance\nas BERT-mix and BERT-mtl, but shows\nto be a better teacher for distillation,\nas Meta-teacher\nTinyBERT-KD\n−−−−−−−−→BERTS and\nMeta-teacher Meta-distillation− −−−−−−−− →BERTS have bet-\nter performance than other methods. This\nshows the meta-teacher is capable of learn-\ning more transferable knowledge to help the\nstudent. The fact that Meta-teacher →Meta-\ndistillation has better performance than other\ndistillation methods conﬁrms the effectiveness\nof the proposed Meta-KD method.\n• Meta-KD gains more improvement on the\nsmall datasets than large ones, e.g. it improves\nfrom 86.7 to 89.4 in Amazon Reviews while\n79.3 to 80.4 in MNLI. This motivates us to\nexplore our model performance on domains\nwith few or no training samples\n4.5 Ablation Study\nWe further investigate Meta-KD’s capability with\nregards to different portion training data for both of\ntwo phases and explore how the transferable knowl-\nedge distillation loss contributes to ﬁnal results.\n4.5.1 No In-domain Data during\nMeta-teacher Learning\nIn this set of experiments, we consider a special\ncase where we assume all the “ﬁction” domain\ndata in MNLI is unavailable. Here, we train a\nmeta-teacher without the “ﬁction” domain dataset\nand use the distillation method proposed in Jiao\net al. (2019) to produce the student model for the\n“ﬁction” domain with in-domain data during dis-\ntillation. The results are shown in Table 4.

Additionally, learning from the\nout-domain meta-teacher has a similar performance\nto KD from the in-domain “ﬁction” teacher model\nitself. It shows the Meta-KD framework can be\napplied in applications for emerging domains.\n4.5.2 Few In-domain Data Available during\nMeta-distillation\nWe randomly sample a part of the MNLI dataset as\nthe training data in this setting. The sample rates\nthat we choose include 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and\n0.2. The sampled domain datasets are employed\nfor training student models when learning from the\nin-domain teacher or the meta-teacher. The experi-\nmental results are shown in Figure 3, with results\nreported by the improvement rate in averaged ac-\ncuracy. The experimental results show that when\nless data is available, the improvement rate is much\nlarger. For example, when we only have 1% of the\noriginal MNLI training data, the accuracy can be\n3034\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTransferable KD factor 2\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95Accuracy (%)\nBooks DVD Electronics Kitchen\nFigure 4: Model performance w.r.t. the transferable\nKD factor γ2\nincreased by approximately 10% when the student\ntries to learn from the meta-teacher. It shows Meta-\nKD can be more beneﬁcial when we have fewer\nin-domain data.\n4.5.3 Inﬂuence of the Transferable\nKnowledge Distillation Loss\nHere, we explore how the transferable KD fac-\ntor γ2 affects the distillation performance over the\nAmazon Reviews dataset. We tune the value of γ2\nfrom 0.1 to 1.0, with results are shown in Figure\n4. We ﬁnd that the optimal value of γ2 generally\nlies in the range of 0.2 - 0.5. The trend of accu-\nracy is different in the domain “DVD” is different\nfrom those of the remaining three domains. This\nmeans the beneﬁts from transferable knowledge of\nthe meta-teacher vary across domains.\n5 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we propose the Meta-KD framework\nwhich consists of meta-teacher learning and meta\ndistillation to distill PLMs across domains. Ex-\nperiments on two widely-adopted public multi-\ndomain datasets show that Meta-KD can train a\nmeta-teacher to digest knowledge across domains\nto help better teach in-domain students. Quantita-\ntive evaluations conﬁrm the effectiveness of Meta-\nKD and also show the capability of Meta-KD in\nthe settings where the training data is scarce i.e.\nthere is no or few in-domain data. In the future,\nwe will examine the generalization capability of\nMeta-KD in other application scenarios and apply\nother meta-learning techniques to KD for PLMs.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by Open Research Projects\nof Zhejiang Lab (No. 2019KD0AD01/004).
