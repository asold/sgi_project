Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance access to culturally speciﬁc healthcare,\nincluding traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This study evaluated the diagnostic and treatment\nperformance of seven publicly available LLMs using a real-world acupuncture case, comparing their\noutputs with three professional acupuncturists acrossﬁve domains: Western diagnosis, TCM\ndiagnosis, acupoint selection, needling technique, and herbal medicine. Twenty-eight expert\nevaluators from China, South Korea, and the United States assessed the responses using a\nmultilingual survey. LLMs performed comparably to acupuncturists in Western diagnosis and showed\nvariable performance in TCM-speciﬁc tasks. GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 Max, and Doubao 1.5 Pro\ndemonstrated the highest alignment with expert evaluations, particularly in TCM diagnosis and\nacupoint selection. Theseﬁndings highlight the potential of general-purpose LLMs to support\nculturally grounded medical decision-making and reduce access barriers in TCM care systems.\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers therapeutic approaches through\nherbal medicine, acupuncture, and Qigong to support neurological disorders1\n,2, mental health3,4,p a i n r e l i e f5,6,w o m e n’s health and fertility7,8, cancer care9,10,\nchronic conditions11,12, disease prevention13,14, and overall wellness15,16.T h e s e\napproaches emphasize personalized treatment based on individual patient\nassessment, syndrome differentiation\n17, and many other disorders/conditions.\nHowever, global adoption of TCM faces signiﬁcant barriers. Its philosophical\nfoundations, such as Yin-Yang balance18, ﬁve elements, and Qiﬂow19,a r e\ndeeply rooted in Chinese philosophy, making them difﬁcult to translate into\nglobal and modern scientiﬁcb i o m e d i c a lm o d e l s20. Additionally, the diag-\nnostic approach in TCM also differs signiﬁcantly from modern Western\nmedicine; while Western protocols typically follow standardized pathways,\nTCM adopts a more personalized and nonlinear diagnosis approach\n21.T h e s e\nphilosophical and methodological differences create substantial and funda-\nmental cultural and systemic barriers to global reach and adoption of TCM,\naffecting broader health equity. Populations unfamiliar with the cultural\ncontext of TCM struggle to fully understand and trust its practices, limiting\ntheir access to its potential beneﬁts. Addressing these cultural disparities is\nessential for transforming TCM into a globally inclusive healthcare option.\nRecent advances in digital health technologies, particularly large lan-\nguage models (LLMs), present an innovative opportunity for making TCM\nmore globally accessible\n22– 25.L L M sh a v ep r o v e nv a l u a b l ei nc l i n i c a ld e c i s i o n\nsupport, diagnostics, and medical documentation26– 29, while also playing an\nexpanding role in medical education30– 32. Furthermore, their multilingual\ncapabilities and adaptability enable more inclusive digital health solutions,\nensuring accessibility for diverse populations through culturally and lin-\nguistically tailored applications33,34. However, the use of LLMs for TCM\npresents unique challenges due to its complex philosophical and linguistic\nnuances. For example, adapting LLMs to TCM-speciﬁc tasks such as syn-\ndrome differentiation, acupuncturepoint selection, and herbal medicine\nrecommendations, require LLMs to bridge signiﬁcant cultural and theore-\ntical gaps\n35. Thus, successfully integrating LLMs into TCM practice\ndemands not only technological advancements but also a deeper under-\nstanding of cross-cultural medical translation capabilities.\nThis study aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs in diagnosing\nand recommending treatments for a complex real-world acupuncture case\nstudy by comparing the performance of seven general-purpose LLMs with\nprofessional acupuncturists. Speciﬁcally, we test three hypotheses: (1) can\n1Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.2Beijing University of Chinese Medicine,\nBeijing, China. e-mail: jkong2@mgh.harvard.edu\nnpj Digital Medicine|           (2025) 8:466 1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\nLLMs provide Western and TCM diagnoses consistent with the assessments\nfrom professional acupuncturists, (2) can LLMs recommend appropriate\nacupuncture points and techniques, and (3) can LLMs suggest suitable\nherbal medicine combinations. As a pilot benchmarking effort, this study\nprovides foundational insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs\nwithin culturally embedded medical systems such as TCM. By exploring\nhow scalable AI tools can bridge linguistic, cultural, and geographic gaps in\nmedical knowledge delivery, ourﬁndings underscore the potential of LLMs\nto promote digital health equity and expand global access to culturally\nrooted care.\nResults\nEvaluator characteristics\nA total of 28 evaluators participated in the study, with the majority being\nfemale (71.43%) and most falling within the 31~40 age group (42.86%). A\nsigniﬁcant proportion (85.71%) had active clinical practice experience.\nGeographically, evaluators were primarily from China (64.29%), followed\nby the United States (21.43%) and South Korea (14.29%). In terms of\neducation, most held a Doctorate Degree (75.00%), while others had post-\ndoctoral training (10.71%), a master’s degree (7.14%), or a bachelor’sd e g r e e\n(7.14%). Academic titles varied, with 25.00% as Full Professors/Chief\nPhysicians, 25.00% serving as Associate Professors/Associate Chief Physi-\ncians, 17.86% as Assistant Professors/Attending Physicians, 10.71% as\nLecturers/Instructors/Residents, and 7.14% as Postdoctoral Fellows. These\ncharacteristics reﬂect a diverse and experienced group of evaluators. These\ndemographic details are summarized in Table1.\nPerformance comparison in Western medical diagnosis\naccuracy\nThe ANOVA analysis showed no signiﬁcant differences in Western medical\ndiagnosis performance across groups (p = 0.953), indicating that all LLMs\ndemonstrated capabilities comparable to professional acupuncturists. The\nmean scores (±standard deviation) for each source were: Gemini\n(4.36 ± 0.87), GPT (4.25 ± 0.80), Qwen (4.14 ± 1.30), Acupuncturist 1\n(4.14 ± 1.27), Acupuncturist 3 (4.11 ± 1.31), Acupuncturist 2 (4.04 ± 1.45),\nLLaMA (4.00 ± 1.28), Claude (4.00± 1.05), Doubao (4.00 ± 1.31), and\nERNIE (3.89 ± 1.26). These results suggest that all evaluated LLMs per-\nformed at levels statistically indistinguishable from human acupuncturists\nin Western medical diagnostic assessments. All detailed performance results\nare summarized in Table2,T a b l e3,F i g .1.\nPerformance comparison in TCM diagnosis accuracy\nThe ANOVA analysis showed signiﬁcant differences in TCM diagnosis\nperformance across groups (p = 0.008). The ranking was as follows: Acu-\npuncturist 3 (4.21 ± 0.92) > Acupuncturist 1 = Acupuncturist 2 (4.14 ± 0.89,\n4.14 ± 1.15) > Qwen (3.93 ± 1.05) > LLaMA (3.57 ± 1.23) > GPT = ERNIE =\nDoubao (3.54 ± 1.17, 3.54 ± 1.29, 3.54 ± 1.10) > Claude (3.46 ± 1.17) >\nGemini (3.21 ± 1.42). Pairwise comparisons revealed that Gemini scored\nsigniﬁcantly lower than Acupuncturist 3 (p = 0.04). No signiﬁcant differences\nwere observed between the LLMs and other professional acupuncturists.\nPerformance comparison in acupoint selection appropriateness\nThe ANOVA analysis revealed signiﬁcant differences in acupoint selection\nperformance across groups (p < 0.001). The ranking from highest to lowest\nscores was as follows: Acupuncturist 1 (4.25 ± 0.70) > Acupuncturist 2\n(4.07 ± 0.90) > Qwen (3.89 ± 0.83) > GPT (3.82 ± 0.72) > Acupuncturist 3\n(3.75 ± 0.80) > Doubao (3.50 ± 0.79) > Claude (3.21 ± 1.10) > LLaMA =\nERNIE (3.14 ± 1.08) > Gemini (3.04 ± 1.07). Pairwise comparisons showed\nthat Qwen and GPT signiﬁcantly outperformed Gemini (p =0 . 0 2a n dp =0 . 0 5 ,\nrespectively). Qwen, GPT, and Doubao exhibited no statistically signiﬁcant\ndifferences across comparisons with Acupuncturists 1, 2, or 3 (allp > 0.05).\nPerformance comparison in needling technique practicability\nThe ANOVA analysis showed signiﬁcant differences in needling technique\nperformance across groups (p < 0.001). From highest to lowest scores, the\nranking was as follows: Acupuncturist 1 (4.04 ± 0.79) > Acupuncturist 2\n(3.86 ± 1.18) > Acupuncturist 3 (3.75 ± 0.70) > GPT (3.71 ± 0.81) > Doubao\n(3.68 ± 0.90) > Qwen (3.43 ± 1.14) > ERNIE (3.36 ± 1.06) > Gemini\n(3.14 ± 1.01) > LLaMA (3.04 ± 1.20) > Claude (2.93 ± 1.05). Pairwise com-\nparisons revealed no statistically signiﬁcant differences among the LLMs\n(p > 0.05). Similarly, no signiﬁcant differences were found between GPT,\nDoubao, Qwen, ERNIE and any of thethree acupuncturists (p > 0.05).\nPerformance comparison in herbal prescription suitability\nThe ANOVA analysis revealed signiﬁcant differences in herbal med-\nicine recommendations across groups (p = 0.001). The ranking from\nhighest to lowest score was as follows: Acupuncturist 2 (4.07 ± 1.02) =\nAcupuncturist 3 (4.07 ± 0.77) > Acupuncturist 1 (3.39 ± 0.92) > Qwen\n(3.36 ± 1.19) = LLaMA (3.36 ± 0.99) > Doubao (3.32 ± 0.98) > GPT\n(3.29 ± 1.15) > ERNIE (3.25 ± 1.08) > Gemini (3.07 ± 1.41) > Claude\n(3.04 ± 1.14).

Similarly,\nfor needling techniques, acupuncturists ranged from 60.7% to 78.6% com-\npared to LLMs (25.0% to 67.9%), where GPT ranked highest. In herbal\nmedicine, acupuncturists scored between 42.9% and 75.0%, exceeding LLMs,\nwhich ranged from 28.6% to 42.9%, with Qwen and Gemini performing best\n(42.9%). Chi-square test results indicate signiﬁcant differences in TCM\ndiagnosis (p < 0.001), acupoint selection (p < 0.001), needling techniques\n(p < 0.001), and herbal medicine prescriptions (p = 0.004), whereas no sig-\nniﬁcant variation was observed in Western medicald i a g n o s i s(p =0 . 9 3 ) .\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we conducted a case-based evaluation of seven publicly\naccessible LLMs and compared their diagnostic and treatment recom-\nmendations with those of experiencedacupuncturists using a real-world\nTCM case. We found that (1) certain LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5\nMax, and Doubao 1.5 Pro, demonstrated performance comparable to\nlicensed acupuncturists in speciﬁc domains such as TCM diagnosis, acu-\npoint selection, and herbal treatment planning, and (2) performance varied\nsubstantially across models and tasks, indicating inconsistency in current\ncapabilities. Theseﬁndings suggest that general-purpose LLMs possess\nfoundational potential to support culturally embedded healthcare systems\nlike TCM. With targeted reﬁnement, they may serve as scalable and cost-\neffective tools to expand access to high-quality, culturally relevant care,\nparticularly in settings where linguistic, geographic, or infrastructural bar-\nriers limit the availability of trained practitioners.\nOur ﬁndings demonstrated exceptional performance in the Western\nmedical diagnostic capabilities of LLMs. In addition, we found that three\nmodels, GPT, Qwen, and Doubao, achieved performance comparable to\nhuman acupuncturists in TCM diagnosis and acupoint selection, while\nshowing more variability in needling techniques and herbal formulation. This\nﬁnding is consistent with broader evaluations where LLMs have shown high\naccuracy in structured and rule-based assessments, such as medical board\nexaminations\n36– 38. These models exhibit a robust understanding of standar-\ndized protocols and diagnostic criteria, enabling them to deliver promising\nresults that match or even surpass human expertise in some scenarios.\nAdditionally, the multilingual processing capabilities of LLMs also present\nanother signiﬁcant advantage in global healthcare applications. LLMs\ndemonstrated proﬁciency in aligning with clinicalguidelines across linguistic\nbarriers, making accurate recommendations in various languages39– 41.T h i s\ncapacity for multilingual processingpromotes equitable access to medical\nknowledge and improves global healthcare accessibility.\nWhile LLMs like GPT, Qwen, and Doubao are comparable to profes-\nsional acupuncturists in multiple tasks in several key domains, their perfor-\nmance was not uniform across all assessment criteria. Although GPT, a\nWestern-developed model, demonstrated strong performance, Chinese-\ndeveloped LLMs, like Qwen and Doubao, outperformed many other models\nin handling culturally sensitive TCMtasks. This suggests that both model\narchitecture and culturally tailored training datasets can enhance perfor-\nmance in areas requiring deep cultural adaptability. Our results have\nimportant implications for addressinglongstanding barriers in globalization\nof TCM. TCM has historically faced challenges in globalization due to its\ncomplex theoretical foundations, cultural nuances, and differences in edu-\ncational systems worldwide\n42,43. These barriers make it difﬁcult for interna-\ntional practitioners and students to access and integrate TCM knowledge into\ntheir practices. LLMs provide innovative potential to address these challenges\nand foster health equity through several processes. First, the ability of LLMs to\nprocess TCM concepts and provide recommendations across multiple lan-\nguages addresses linguistic barriers and enables broader engagement with\nTCM practices\n33,35,44. The strong performance of culturally adapted models\nlike GPT, Qwen, and Doubao demonstrates the potential for maintaining\nAsian cultural authenticity while increasing accessibility of TCM. Further-\nmore, LLMs’scalability and cost-effectiveness, and digital nature make them\npowerful tools for democratizing TCM education and distribution, particu-\nlarly in regions where access to trained acupuncturists is limited\n42,45,46.\nNevertheless, LLMs still face signiﬁcant challenges in handling culturally\nsensitive and complex tasks within TCM.

In contrast, Qwen and Doubao, along with GPT, consistently achieved\nperformance levels comparable to acupuncturists in culturally nuanced tasks,\nparticularly in TCM diagnosis and acupoint selection, while still showing\nvariability in other domains such as needling techniques and herbal for-\nmulation. These models demonstrated better performance than other\nmodels, likely due to their training with more regionally and culturally\nrelevant data. These performance variations may be primarily inﬂuenced by\nmodel architecture\n47,t r a i n i n gd a t a48, ﬁne-tuning49, domain specialization50,\nand reasoning ability51. The comparable performance of GPT demonstrates\nthe impact of its advanced architecture,large-scale parameters, and reasoning\ncapabilities, allowing it to achieve high diagnostic accuracy even without\nexplicit cultural optimization52–55. The stronger performance of Chinese-\ndeveloped models (Qwen and Doubao) indicates that they might beneﬁtf r o m\ntargeted optimization for Chinese medical corpora, improving text\ncomprehension and diagnostic reasoning56. Their integration of Chinese\nclinical guidelines and traditional decoction provides a distinct advantage in\nculturally sensitive tasks57, with reasoning patterns that more closely align\nwith those of Chinese physicians. Ourﬁndings highlight fundamental chal-\nlenges in applying LLMs to TCM practices, as the diagnostic framework relies\nheavily on complex subjective and culturally embedded methods such as\npulse analysis, tongue observation, and syndrome differentiation17,56,58.T h e s e\nholistic and dynamic approaches and elements pose additional challenges for\nLLMs that are primarily trained on Western medical datasets\n57,59.F u r t h e r -\nmore, the lack of large, standardized datasets speciﬁct oT C Me x a c e r b a t e s\nt h e s ei s s u e s ,l e a v i n gm a n yL L M su n a b l et of u l l yr e p l i c a t et h ee x p e r t i s e\nrequired for culturally sensitive TCM practices56.

While this allowed for a controlled comparison across\nmultiple domains, it may limit the generalizability of theﬁndings. Broader\nvalidation using diverse case types and disease categories is needed to\ndetermine LLM adaptability in more varied clinical settings. Second, all LLM\nresponses were generated from structured case texts without real-time\ninteraction. This non-interactive format does not replicate the real-world\nprocess in which a practitioner interprets a patient’s natural expressions and\nthen translates them into TCM terms. In clinical settings, TCM diagnosis\noften depends on spontaneous patient language, behavioral cues, and subtle\ncontextual factors that are difﬁcult to capture in standardized written formats.\nIn addition, while this study evaluated acupoint selection and needling\ntechniques, it did not assess treatment implementation or patient response,\nboth of which are critical to therapeutic outcomes in acupuncture. Future\nresearch should incorporate more interactive methodologies, such as clinical\nsimulations or real patient interviewsusing AI-Agent, to better approximate\nreal-world diagnostic workﬂows in TCM and evaluate how LLMs perform\nunder more naturalistic and context-rich conditions. Third, while we used a\nﬁve-domain scoring rubric developed through expert consensus, the fra-\nmework has not been externally validated. Although predeﬁned criteria were\napplied, some subjectivity in evaluator judgments may remain. Formal\nassessment of inter-rater reliability and the development of standardized\nevaluation tools tailored to TCM practice are important next steps. Fourth,\nthe models examined were general-purpose LLMs that had not beenﬁne-\ntuned on medical or TCM-speciﬁc corpora. The results should therefore be\ninterpreted as a baseline assessment of current capabilities.

It is expected that\nfuture domain-specialized models trained on curated TCM datasets will show\nimproved contextual understanding and clinical accuracy.\nTo address these limitations and support the responsible integration of\nAI into TCM practice, future researchshould prioritize the development of\nhigh-quality, domain-speciﬁc corpora. These should include classical TCM\ntexts, modern clinical guidelines, trial data, and real-world patient records to\nalign model outputs with TCM theory, language, and diagnostic reasoning.\nExpanding datasets to include diverse cases and longitudinal, multi-case\nevaluations will be essential for testing performance across varied clinical\nsettings.\nFurthermore, incorporating AI agents and multimodal diagnostic\ninputs, such as tongue images or pulse waveforms, could allow the AI to\ncommunicate with the patient directly to mimic real clinical settings,\nenhancing the realism and clinical utility of LLMs. Also, expert-in-the-\nloop learning approaches would allow continuous reﬁnement based on\npractitioner feedback, while explainable AI tools can support transpar-\nency and clinician trust. From a system-level perspective, cross-cultural\nvalidation and prospective clinical trials will be necessary to determine\nwhether LLM-informed TCM care improves diagnostic accuracy,\nhealthcare access, and patient outcomes, particularly in underserved or\nresource-constrained environments. These efforts will help deﬁne the role\nof LLMs within global digital health ecosystems. Ultimately, advancing the\nuse of LLMs in TCM requires close collaboration among practitioners, AI\ndevelopers, and policy experts. By fostering culturally sensitive, inclusive,\nand evidence-based innovation, LLMs can contribute meaningfully to the\nmission of digital health equity and support more accessible, high-quality\ncare for all.\nIn summary, this study establishes an initial benchmark for evaluating\nthe diagnostic and treatment capabilities of LLMs in TCM. Using a stan-\ndardized clinical case, we found thatwhile general-purpose LLMs demon-\nstrated performance comparable to licensed acupuncturists in Western\nmedical diagnosis, their capabilities varied considerably across TCM-\nspeciﬁc domains. Notably, GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 Max, and Doubao 1.5 Pro\nexhibited the highest alignment with licensed acupuncturists in TCM\ndiagnosis, acupoint selection,and needling techniques. Theseﬁndings\nhighlight the potential of LLMs as accessible and scalable tools to support\nTCM care, particularly in settings with limited healthcare resources. Future\nresearch should prioritize domain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning, AI-agent, multi-\nmodal input integration, and real-world clinical validation to enhance both\nperformance and reliability. As LLMs continue to evolve, their thoughtful\nintegration into TCM practice holds signiﬁcant potential to bridge tradi-\ntional medical knowledgewith modern healthcare systems, contributing to\na more equitable and culturally inclusive digital health future.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis survey-based study evaluated the diagnostic and treatment recom-\nmendations of seven LLMs and three acupuncturists, assessed indepen-\ndently by 28 professional acupuncturists. A clinically complex and\neducationally representative case of ALS was selected from a peer-\nreviewed TCM case report\n60. ALS was chosen for its neurological com-\nplexity, integration of Western and TCM diagnostic elements, and rele-\nvance to acupuncture education and practice in China\n61. These\ncharacteristics made it a suitable case example for benchmarking LLM\nperformance across multiple diagnostic and treatment domains. The case\nwas reformatted to include detailed patient history, physical examination\nﬁndings, and TCM diagnosis to provide uniform inputs (Supplementary\nTable 1). Each LLM and acupuncturist was treated as an independent\n“model” and assessed acrossﬁve domains: diagnostic accuracy (Western\nand TCM), acupoint selection, needling technique, and herbal prescrip-\ntion appropriateness. Blinding and bias mitigation strategies were\nimplemented to enhance the validity. A detailed overview of the study\ndesign is provided in Fig.2.\nTable 4 | Proportion of high-scoring recommendations (≥4) across evaluation domains\nModel/Expert Western Medical Diagnosis N(%) TCM Diagnosis N (%) Acupoint Selection N(%) Needling Technique N (%) Herbal Medicine N (%)\nGPT 22 (78.60%) 13 (46.40%) 20 (71.40%) 19 (67.90%) 11 (39.30%)\nGemini 23 (82.10%) 14 (50.00%) 9 (32.10%) 9 (32.10%) 12 (42.90%)\nLLaMA 21 (75.00%) 14 (50.00%) 9 (32.10%) 7 (25.00%) 11 (39.30%)\nClaude 20 (71.40%) 12 (42.90%) 10 (35.70%) 7 (25.00%) 8 (28.60%)\nERNIE 19 (67.90%) 15 (53.60%) 10 (35.70%) 14 (50.00%) 10 (35.70%)\nQwen 22 (78.60%) 21 (75.00%) 17 (60.70%) 13 (46.40%) 12 (42.90%)\nDoubao 20 (71.40%) 15 (53.60%) 13 (46.40%) 15 (53.60%) 10 (35.70%)\nAcupuncturist 1 23 (82.10%) 24 (85.70%) 24 (85.70%) 22 (78.60%) 12 (42.90%)\nAcupuncturist 2 22 (78.60%) 22 (78.60%) 23 (82.10%) 19 (67.90%) 20 (71.40%)\nAcupuncturist 3 23(82.10%) 24 (85.70%) 15 (53.60%) 17 (60.70%) 21 (75.00%)\np-value 0.93 <0.001 * <0.001* <0.001* 0.004*\nThis table reports the number and percentage of evaluator scores≥4 (on a 5-point Likert scale) acrossﬁve domains for each of the 7 LLMs and 3 professional acupuncturists.

Seven generative LLMs were selected for\nevaluation based on the following criteria: (1) representation of leading\ninternational or Chinese developers, including models designed for English\nand Chinese language tasks; (2) public availability through free or low-cost\nuser interfaces to ensure accessibility and reproducibility; and (3) general-\npurpose design withoutﬁne-tuning in medicine or TCM, allowing for an\nunbiased evaluation of baseline performance in TCM diagnostic and\ntreatment recommendations.\nThe models included in this study were GPT-4o (OpenAI), Gemini 1.5\nFlash (Google), LLaMA 3.2 (Meta), Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic), ERNIE\n3.5 (Baidu), Qwen 2.5 Max (Alibaba), and Doubao 1.5 Pro (ByteDance).\nDetailed speciﬁcations are provided in Supplementary Table 2. All models\nwere accessed through publicly available user interfaces without any\nexternal plugins or real-time internet access. Therefore, all generated\nresponses were based solely on the models’pre-trained knowledge available\nat the time of data collection. None of the models had been speciﬁcally\ntrained orﬁne-tuned on medical or TCM data. Each model was tasked with\nresponding to three prompts designedto assess its ability to translate,\ndiagnose, and recommend treatments (see Supplementary Table 3):\n1. Prompt #1: Please translate the following case report into English. As\nthe case of a medical questionnaire, the context must be provided\nconcisely, clearly, coherently, andaccurately. The full case report,\nincluding detailed patient history, physical examination, and TCM\ndiagnosis, is provided in the supplementary material (Supplementary\nTable 1).\n2. Prompt #2: Please offer both Western and TCM diagnoses based on\nthe provided patient information. As the case of a medical ques-\ntionnaire, the context must be provided concisely, clearly, coherently,\nand accurately (Less than 150 counts).\n3. Prompt #3:D e s i g na na c u p u n c t u r et r e a t m e n tp l a nf o rt h i sp a t i e n t ,\nincluding selection of primary and supplementary acupuncture points,\nneedling techniques, and details on the angle, direction, and depth of\ninsertion. Additionally, recommend an herbal medicine as adjunct\ntherapy. As the case of a medical questionnaire, the context must be\nprovided concisely, clearly, coherently, and accurately (Less than 150\ncounts).\nRecommendations by licensed acupuncturists\nTo establish a benchmark for evaluating LLMs, experienced TCM acu-\npuncturists were recruited based on the following inclusion criteria: (1)\npossession of a valid license as a TCM or acupuncture practitioner; (2) a\nminimum of eight years of clinical acupuncture experience; (3) active\nclinical practice in a hospital or an academic acupuncture department.\nTwo acupuncturists met these criteria: Acupuncturist 1, MSc, an\nattending TCM physician at a hospital in Guangzhou, China, with about ten\nyears of clinical experience, and Acupuncturist 2, PhD, a full professor in the\nDepartment of Acupuncture, chief physician, and senior clinician at a\nhospital in Chengdu, China, with more than ten years of clinical experience.\nThe third set of clinical responses was extracted from the original peer-\nreviewed case report\n60, in which the author was identiﬁed as a clinician (with\naM a s t e r’sd e g r e e )a fﬁliated with Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese\nMedicine, with about 8 years of clinical experience.\nThe participating acupuncturists were provided with standardized case\ninformation, identical to what was given to the LLMs through three\nprompts, including detailed clinical history, examinationﬁndings, and\npreliminary diagnoses. They were not aware of the study’sa i m sb e f o r e\ncompleting their responses to minimize potential bias. Each acupuncturist\nwas instructed to independently provide a written response, which was\nsubmitted via email. All participants were encouraged to complete their\nrecommendations independently(see Supplementary Table 3).\nEvaluation criteria\nThe recommendations were evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale across\nﬁve criteria: (1) accuracy of Western medical diagnoses, (2) accuracy of\nTCM diagnoses, (3) appropriateness of acupuncture point selection, (4)\npracticability of needling techniques, and (5) suitability ofherbal medicine.\nScoring deﬁnitions and thresholds were standardized to ensure consistency\nacross evaluations (Table5).\nEvaluator selection and survey implementation\nProfessional acupuncturists from China, South Korea, and the United\nStates participated as independent evaluators to assess the diagnostic and\ntreatment responses generated by both LLMs and licensed acupuncturists.\nEvaluators were selected based on the following criteria: (1) active\ninvolvement in either clinical care or academic activities (e.g., teaching or\nresearch) in acupuncture or TCM; and (2) afﬁliation with a TCM hospital/\nclinic or an accredited university/institution. Recruitment was conducted\nthrough email invitations distributed through professional networks,\ninstitutional collaborations of all co-authors, and academic referrals. As a\npilot study designed to provide preliminary insights, a broad pool of\nqualiﬁed professionals was invited. Of those invited, 28 evaluators com-\npleted the full assessment within the designated timeframe and were\nincluded in the ﬁnal analysis. To reduce bias, evaluators were not\ninformed that some responses were generated by LLMs. They were told\nthat the study aimed to examine variation in diagnostic and treatment\nrecommendations from different sources. All evaluators were blinded to\nthe study hypothesis, evaluation criteria, and the identities of the\nrespondents.\nEach evaluator received a standardized survey translated into Chinese,\nKorean, or English through a forward-backward translation process to\nensure accuracy and cultural equiv alence. Evaluators independently\nreviewed anonymized diagnostic and treatment responses and rated them\nusing predeﬁned criteria. All responses were submitted anonymously\nthrough the secure online survey platform“Wenjuanxing”\n62 (www.wjx.cn)\nbetween November 1 and November 30, 2024.\nBias mitigation\nTo minimize bias, a standardized evaluation guide with clear scoring deﬁ-\nnitions and examples was provided to all evaluators. The order of responses\nwas randomized, and all identifying labels (e.g.,“AI” or“acupuncturist”)w e r e\nremoved to ensure impartial assessments. Independent evaluations were\nconducted under blinded conditions to prevent inﬂuence by prior responses.\nEthical approval\nThis study was reviewed and determined to be exempt from full ethical\nreview by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board (Pro-\ntocol #: 2025P001014) under 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2). The research\ninvolved no identiﬁable private information or direct interaction with\nhuman participants, and relied solely on a publicly available, de-\nidentiﬁed clinical case and anonymous expert survey data. Informed\nconsent was waived in accordance with relevant policy\n63,64. All proce-\ndures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki\nand applicable guidelines\n65.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version\n29.0.1.0\n66. Descriptive statistics were reported as means ± standard devia-\ntions for continuous variables and as counts (n) with percentages for cate-\ngorical variables. Group differences were assessed using one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) for continuous variables, followed by Tukey’sH o n e s t\nSigniﬁcant Difference (HSD) test for post-hoc pairwise comparisons when\napplicable. Chi-square tests were conducted for categorical variables across\nmultiple groups. All analyses were two-tailed, with statistical signiﬁcance set\nat p < 0.05.
