INTRODUCTION\nThe fast-growing population requires industrialization at a\nsubstantial level to cope with their needs, particularly for\ndeveloping and underdeveloped nations. The fast industrial\ndevelopment would lead to the rapid and consistent growth\nin energy demand [1]. In addition, a deﬁcit of fossil fuels\nwould hurdle energy development, and many nations are\nfacing this challenge and hence looking forward to it. One\npossible solution is to expand their renewable energy based\nelectricity generation.

MOTIVATION AND INCITEMENT\nTo meet enormous energy demand, most national, regional,\nurban, and rural grids opted for grid interconnection [5].\nThe resulting grid interconnection offers greater reliabil-\nity, thereby offering reduced electricity generation cost and\nimproves the power supply services [6]. In addition, the inter-\nconnection of power networks avoids generating reserve\nrequirements in each system.

Furthermore, the interconnection\nof power system networks leads to the ease of the electricity\n105588 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

It enables the commercialization of power through\nmultiple provinces and nations. Most power system networks\nin the world today operate at either 50 Hz or 60 Hz frequen-\ncies. The integration of nearby power networks is a dynamic\napproach to the global energy system today, and further\nresearch in this ﬁeld is of quite an interest globally. There is a\ndevelopment of multiple microgrids, integration of multiple\nrenewables to the utility grids, and the interconnection of\nvarious national, regional and local power grids [7]–[10]. Due\nto the above facts, many researchers and power engineers are\nlooking forward to various grid interconnection technologies\nand different power ﬂow controllers.\nB. LITERATURE REVIEW\nTo interconnect two power systems, a reliable and cost-\neffective interconnector (link) is required. Two power\nsystems may be interconnected via synchronous intercon-\nnection and asynchronous interconnection. The synchronous\ninterconnection allows the interconnection of power grids\noperating at the same frequency through an AC link. This\narrangement offers simplicity as well as economic feasibil-\nity [11]. However, this method imposes complexity in the\noperation of the power system. Moreover, it also imposes\nserious stability limitations under severe fault conditions [12].\nThe control of power transfer through these connection\nlines is regulated by different power ﬂow controlling devices\nsuch as phase-shifting transformer (PST) [13], [14], sen\ntransformer (ST) [15], [16], rotary power ﬂow controller\n(RPFC) [17], [18], and FACTS controller [19]. In the case\nof PST, the power ﬂow can be assessed by controlling the\nline voltage vector. However, control of power transfer is\naccompanied in steps by changing the tapings of the trans-\nformer, which ultimately results in sluggish control of power.\nIndependent control of real and reactive power ﬂow can\nbe attained by using Sen Transformer (ST) [20]. However,\nST has limitations of output error and sluggish response [15],\n[21]. The RPFC claims better results than PST but requires\nan isolated drive system for rotation of rotor shaft [22].\nA comparative study of various power ﬂow controllers used\nfor controlling the power ﬂow in synchronous interconnected\npower systems is presented in Table 1.\nThe FACTS controller is emerging from the roots of power\nelectronics to control one or more power transmission param-\neters. There are various FACTS controllers which have been\nevolved for the control of power transfer through AC link.\nThe conventional FACTS controller is static var compen-\nsator (SVC) which is a variable impedance type. The SVC\nis usually placed in a shunt with the power network. More-\nover, the thyristor switched series reactor (TSSR), thyristor-\ncontrolled series reactor (TCSR), thyristor-controlled series\ncapacitor (TCSC) are series FACTS controllers. However,\ndrawbacks related to these controllers are the injection of\ncurrent harmonics, and their sluggish response [33]. Table 2\nsummarizes various FACTS controllers used for controlling\nthe power ﬂow in the interconnected power system networks.\nThe other method of the interconnection of two power\nsystems operating at the same or different frequencies is\nasynchronous interconnection. A high voltage direct cur-\nrent (HVDC) system is a common technique to implement\nasynchronous interconnection. The HVDC system is eco-\nnomical for large distances and a huge amount of power\ntransfer. However, the high cost of converters, demands of\nreactive power, production of harmonics, and the problems of\ncircuit breaking restricts its applications [45]–[47]. Moreover,\nHVDC link also has operating problem where low AC power\nis linked on any of the two sides [48]. A summary of various\nHVDC topologies used for asynchronous interconnections\nare presented in Table 3.\nAn asynchronous interconnection may also be made by a\nvirtual synchronous machine (VSM) to integrate distributed\ngenerators (DGs) into the utility grid. The concept of VSM\nhas evolved to provide aspects of controllability and stability\nof a conventional synchronous machine in the control of\npower electronic converters [62]. The problems associated\nwith the installation of VSM include generating oscillations\nof reduced frequency in the power systems, which is a result\nof interaction between the synchronous generators [63].\nAlternatively, asynchronous interconnection can also be\nmade by the variable frequency transformer (VFT). Over the\npast decade, the VFT has proven itself to be an effective\nmeans for asynchronous interconnection, and a perfect con-\ntender of PST in synchronous interconnection [64], [65].\nThe VFT was initially introduced by General Electric (GE)\nin the US in the 1990s and successfully used on the power\ngrid in the early 21st century. The world’s maiden VFT\nwas developed at Hydro-Quebec’s Langlois substation in\nOctober 2003, where it used to transport 100 MW of elec-\ntric power between the power grids of Quebec, Canada,\nand New York, US [66]–[68]. A negotiation was signed\nin 2001 with corporations for installing a 100 MW VFT\nat Langlois substation. Initially, many simulator tests were\nperformed to verify the adaptableness nature of VFT, and the\nVFT was then tested in the physical environment in 2003.\nThe VFT was ﬁrst used in operation as a phase-shifter\nin parallel with the local network in April 2004 for eight\nmonths. Due to the continuous satisfying operation during\nthis period, ﬁnally, the industrial operation commenced in\nApril 2005. The successful operation of the maiden VFT\ngained a signiﬁcant attraction of researchers, and its appli-\ncation scope began to extend. Consequently, the world’s\nnext VFT was ﬁnanced by American Electric Power (AEP)\nand produced by GE. This VFT was established at Laredo\nSubstation in southwestern Texas, and its commercial oper-\nation commenced in 2007 for interconnecting Texas Power\nGrid with Mexico Power Grid [69], [70]. The third VFT\nwas successfully inaugurated among PJM power grid and\nNYISO power grid in 2010 [71]–[73]. The variable frequency\ntransformer (VFT) is an engineered energy conversion device\nthat is a mighty alternative for asynchronous grid intercon-\nnection with huge rotating inertia that provides coherent\ndamping capability to damp out grid oscillations [74], [75].\nVOLUME 9, 2021 105589\nM.

Power flow controllers used in interconnected power system networks.\nThe VFT integrates technologies of power transformer,\nphase-shifter, hydro generator, doubly-fed generator, and dc\ndrive control [76], [77].\nThe VFT is one of the most appealing and reliable inno-\nvations in the ﬁeld of the power system in this century\nin the context of asynchronous interconnection. Therefore,\nit is necessary to have a detailed review of VFT technology\ndeveloped and reported in the literature so far. This paper\nfocuses on a comprehensive study of VFT technology used\nin asynchronous grid interconnection. This study includes\nVFT constructional details, VFT installations, comparison of\nVFT with back-to-back HVDC link, various control schemes\nutilized to improve the VFT performance, various conﬁgu-\nrations of VFT systems, including VFT park for huge power\nexchange and BDFIM based VFT system, and detailed math-\nematical model of VFT system.

VFT SYSTEM AND ITS COMPONENTS\nThe VFT is essentially a continuously variable phase-shifting\ntransformer that can operate at the controllable phase\nangle [78]. The essential component of the VFT is a\ndoubly-fed induction machine (DFIM) which works as a\nrotating transformer, comprising of three-phase balanced\nwindings on the stator and the rotor [79]. One power system\nVOLUME 9, 2021 105591\nM. M. Khanet al.: Research on VFT: Smart Power Transmission Technology\nTABLE 3. Summary of different HVDC topologies used for asynchronous interconnection.\nFIGURE 1. General configuration of VFT system.\nis connected to the rotor while the other power system is\nconnected to the stator of the VFT system. The various com-\nponents of the VFT system are shown in Fig. 1. The VFT rota-\ntory system consists of a rotating transformer to exchange the\npower between two asynchronous power systems and a drive\nmotor to apply control torque on the rotating transformer to\nregulate the power ﬂow. It also has a collector system that\nconducts current between the three-phase rotor winding and\nits stationary buswork [80].\nThe external DC motor provides the controlling torque.\nRegulation of speed and torque applied to the rotor results\nin a stable power exchange. When the grids’ operating fre-\nquencies are the same, the rotor of VFT tries to orient in a\nposition depending on the variance in phase angle between\nthe two power grids. In this case, power transferred is ideally\nzero. To initiate the power transfer, the rotor of VFT is\nallowed to rotate. Assuming applied torque in one way, power\ntransfers from the grid have a higher phase angle to the grid\nhaving a smaller phase angle. If the applied torque is reversed,\nthe direction of power exchange is also reversed. The net\npower exchange is a function of magnitude as well as the\ndirection of torque applied to the rotor [81]. Even at idle\nposition (when the normal operating speed of VFT is zero),\nthe drive motor is meant to produce torque consistently. When\nthe operating frequencies of both grids are unequal, the rotor\nof VFT rotates continually. Hence, the rotational speed is\na function of variance in frequencies of the two grids [82].\nTherefore, load ﬂow is retained. The VFT is considered for\ncontinuous power exchange control even if there are ﬂoating\nfrequencies on both grids. Irrespective of the power exchange,\nthe rotor is implicitly oriented to follow the variance in\nphase angle set by two of the asynchronous systems. Unlike\nother power electronic topologies, VFT does not generate\nharmonics and avoids intolerable interactions with adjacent\ngenerators or other equipment on the grid [72].\nIII. SALIENT FEATURES OF VFT SYSTEM\nThe classical back-to-back HVDC link ﬁnds its practical\nfeasibility for establishing an asynchronous interconnection\nbetween the two power systems. However, it causes seri-\nous concerns that may threaten the stability of the power\n105592 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. M. Khanet al.: Research on VFT: Smart Power Transmission Technology\nTABLE 4. Comparison of VFT with HVDC systems for an asynchronous\ninterconnection [source:GE].\nsystem [83]. In this context, it is essential to ﬁnd an effective\nalternate solution. The VFT offers lead over the classical\nback-to-back HVDC link in the following aspects [84], [85]:\n(i) Natural damping ability to suppress power oscilla-\ntions because of having huge rotational inertia of the\nmachine.\n(ii) The operation is harmonics free as there are no power\nelectronic components involved in the principal path\nof power exchange.\n(iii) Smaller footprint because of having the large power\ndensity of a hydro generator design and no ﬁlters\nrequirement.\n(iv) Little control interface with various distinct units of\nthe network (slower dynamics prevent any kind of\ncontrol interfere with adjacent devices).\n(v) High overloading capability (due to its large thermal\ntime constant).\n(vi) Isolated control of real and reactive power exchange\nthrough the VFT, and\n(vii) Avoid spreading up of fault from one side to another\nside of the network.\nMoreover, a comparison of VFT with classical HVDC and\nVSC-HVDC is also illustrated in the Table 4. It is revealed\nfrom the Table 4 that VFT may be a suitable alternative\nto back-to-back HVDC link at a broader level for realizing\nthe asynchronous interconnection. Moreover, a description\nof few U.S. patents on VFT is also presented in the Table 5.\nA comprehensive table depicting thorough details of success-\nful operating VFT installations so far is shown in the Table 6.\nIV. CONTROL STRATEGIES USED IN VFT SYSTEM\nVarious control strategies are proposed in the literature\nto achieve smooth control over real and reactive power\nexchange, and reliable and secure operation of the VFT\nsystem [85]–[87]. As mentioned in Table 7, the proposed\ncontrol methods can improve the dynamic response of VFT\nduring grid disturbances and avoid the spreading of fault\nfrom one side of VFT to another side. Moreover, sufﬁcient\nreactive power control and immunization against all types of\nasymmetrical faults are achieved.\nFIGURE 2. Hierarchical control scheme suggested for synchronization and\ncontrol of power exchange [86].\nThe proposed hierarchical control scheme provides a\ncomplete control over the VFT. Moreover, a series dynamic\nbraking resistor (SDBR) is also proposed to enhance the\nfault ride-through (FRT) capability of the VFT system [86].\nA detailed hierarchical control including all the essential\ncontrols is represented in three stages. A practical approach to\ninterconnect two asynchronous power systems through VFT\nis discussed below.\nThe stator of the machine is straightly tied to the PG-1\n(power grid-1) having frequency f1 and phase angle θ1, and\nthe rotor is directly connected to PG-2 having frequency\nf2 and phase angle θ2. To initiate the asynchronous inter-\nconnection, connect PG-1 to the stator side by closing the\ncircuit breaker of sending end CBSE meanwhile, the circuit\nbreaker of receiving end CBRE is open. During this instant,\nmeasure the frequency fm and phase angle θm of the voltage\ninduced across the rotor windings (v m,abc) at CBRE terminals.\nMeasure the frequency f2 and phase angle θ2 of PG-2 voltage\n(v2,abc) available on the other side of CBRE . At this instant,\ndc motor drive is used to obtain the matching of frequency\nand phase angle. This controlling part is taken care in stage-1\nand stage-2. Since, once the interconnection is established,\npower exchange is regulated in stage-3. The control block\ndiagram explaining these three corresponding stages of the\nrecommended hierarchical control scheme is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe modiﬁcation from one step to next step is attained using\nthe states S1, S2, S3 as mention in Fig. 2 with predeter-\nmined sequence along with SDBR protection strategy shown\nin Fig. 3.\nA. STAGES IN HIERARCHICAL CONTROL SCHEME\n1) STAGE-1: FREQUENCY COORDINATION\nAt ﬁrst, when the stator of VFT is connected across PG-1,\nthe rotor is idle, and CBRE is open, to initiate the frequency\nmatching step, a command S1 =1 is released. At this event,\nVOLUME 9, 2021 105593\nM. M. Khanet al.: Research on VFT: Smart Power Transmission Technology\nTABLE 5. US patents granted on VFT system.\nTABLE 6. Details of the VFT installation with their basic characteristics.\nfrequency of the rotor induced voltage fm is to be changed\nfrom fm = f1 to fm = f2. In order to implement this\ndesired frequency transform, the equivalent speed of rotor\ncorresponding to which the rotor of VFT ought to be directed\nby dc motor drive is,\nN∗\nref =120(f1 −f2)\np (1)\nThus, reference (N ∗\nref ) and actual (N ref ) speeds are mea-\nsured against each other using comparator, and the corre-\nsponding error, Ea is generated which is further processed\nto the PI controller to initiate the required armature voltage\n(V ∗\nA,1) to feed dc motor. Whenever the average value of sheer\nspeed error (E a) falls under 1 rev/min, S1 goes low and S2\ngoes high, which introduces the next phase of the control.\n2) STAGE-2: PHASE-ANGLE COORDINATION\nIn this stage, phase angle coordinating between (v m,abc) and\n(v2,abc) is achieved using abc to dq transformation. This abc\nto dq transformation is applied on the measured rotor induced\nvoltages (v m,abc) using phase angle (θ 2) of PG-2 voltage\n(v2,abc), achieved through phase locked loop (PLL), gives the\ndirect (v m,d ) and quadrature (v m,q) components of the rotor\ninduced voltages referred to PG-2 voltage phasor. By setting,\nvm,q =0, phase angle matching can be achieved. In order to\nimplement this desired condition, a PI controller is operated\nthrough the vm,q to produce the required armature voltage\n(V ∗\nA,2). Whenever, the average value of sheer phase angle\nerror, Eb falls below a pre-set margin, S2 falls low allowing\nfor the completion of stage-2. Once, the frequency and phase\nangle matching is achieved, CBRE is allowed to close to\n105594 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. M. Khanet al.: Research on VFT: Smart Power Transmission Technology\nTABLE 7. Control strategies to improve the performance of VFT.\ninterconnect two power grids via VFT. Eventually, S3 goes\nhigh to initiate the power exchange controller.\n3) STAGE-3: POWER EXCHANGE CONTROL\nThe real power transfer (P VFT ) from PG-1 to PG-2 is allowed\nto measure at the stator side of the machine and hence,\nis compared against the reference power (P ∗\nVFT ), and the\ncorresponding error, Ec is passed over PI controller to cause\nthe required armature voltage (V ∗\nA,3) and thus, regulates the\ntorque advanced by the dc motor drive.\nB. SDBR-BASED FAULT RIDE-THROUGH CONTROL\nBoth the SDBR control along with error unveiling is incorpo-\nrated in the hierarchical control scheme of Fig. 3. In the event\nof the fault at the grid, to avoid rotor acceleration, the power\nexchange should be controlled at its pre-fault value by forcing\nS3 =0 in order to have the corresponding output of the PI\ncontroller at its pre-fault value. To damp out rotor oscillations\nat this event, a command S1 =1 is again issued via regulating\nthe torque of dc motor drive. At the same time, a combina-\ntion of several resistors in SDBR is inserted to restrict the\npropagation of fault from faulted circuit to healthy one. This\ncontrol is implemented with the help of a two-dimensional\nlookup table which is a function of VFT current and fault\nvoltage magnitudes. The output of the lookup table deﬁnes\nthe condition of switches Sw1, Sw2, and Sw3 which enables\nthe insertion of the proper combination of various resistances.\nOnce the fault is ﬁnished, the power exchange controller is\nrevitalized by releasing the control signals S1 =S2 =0,\nS3 =1 to allow the control of power transfer.\nC. DECOUPLED P-Q CONTROL\nThe reasons for uncontrolled reactive power ﬂow through\nthe VFT are (i) variations of the magnitude of the grid volt-\nages from their nominal values, (ii) change in active power\nﬂow (magnitude and direction). The reactive power exchange\nthrough the VFT can be governed by utilizing the series volt-\nage method of compensation. Hence, a VFT conﬁguration is\nsuggested that incorporates the series voltage method of com-\npensation into the traditional VFT system to obtain complete\ncontrol for reactive power exchange as shown in Fig. 4 [85].\nThe traditional thyristor-based dc motor drive is being\nreplaced by IGBT based dc motor drive in the proposed\nconﬁguration. This dc drive includes a shunt inverter fol-\nlowing with dc chopper hence, allowing for a common\ndc-link line. The series inverter is also linked over the iden-\ntical dc-link line. For the given scheme, the shunt inverter\nretains the voltage of the dc-link line at a ﬁxed value\nVOLUME 9, 2021 105595\nM. M. Khanet al.: Research on VFT: Smart Power Transmission Technology\nFIGURE 3. Flow diagram suggested for hierarchical control scheme and\nSDBR control [86].\nFIGURE 4. VFT configuration for independent control of real-reactive\npower exchange [85].\nunder the complete range of operation. The dc chopper is\nused to control the torque of dc motor by maintaining the\narmature voltage. The literature illustrates that the series\ninverter along with the series transformer provides a control-\nlable voltage source placed in series with the stator side of\nthe VFT.\nConsequently, the effectual voltage of the grid observed\non the stator side of VFT is the grid voltage available at\nPCC-1 plus voltage forced by the series voltage method\nof compensation. As far as sizing of various components\nis concerned, the series inverter and series transformer rat-\nings, i.e., series voltage compensation scheme, must be\n≤0.1 p.u. subjected to the condition of variation of ±5 per-\ncent in voltage magnitude of the two power grids. However,\nthe power capacity of the dc chopper is intact. The rating\nof the shunt inverter is designed to handle the currents of\nthe series inverter and dc chopper. Thus, the whole control\npart of the proposed scheme is completed into the following\nthree-stages [85].\nFIGURE 5. Control scheme of the proposed for independent control of\nreal-reactive power exchange [85].\n1) STAGE-1: CONTROL OF SHUNT INVERTER\nThe shunt inverter is used to precisely maintain the dc-link\nvoltage at its mentioned value independent of the direction\nof power transfer. The equation in the synchronous refer-\nence frame of the voltage equity over the coupling inductor\n(L) along with an internal resistance (R) is given by [85],\nv∗\nsh,d =−\n(\nRish,d +L dish,d\ndt\n)\n+ωLish,q +v1,d\nv∗\nsh,q =−\n(\nRish,q +L dish,q\ndt\n)\n−ωLish,d +v1,q (2)\nTherefore, the real and reactive powers carried by the shunt\ninverter is,\nP =3\n2v1,d ish,d\nQ =3\n2v1,d ish,q (3)\nFrom the above equation, it is shown that ish,d is used to\nregulate the real power and so the dc-link voltage.\n2) STAGE-2: CONTROL OF DC CHOPPER\nThe dc chopper is used to regulate the armature voltage\napplied across the dc motor (V A) to control the rotor speed\nof VFT. The reference value of the voltage applied across\narmature (V ∗\nA ) can be produced using the control scheme\ndiscussed in [86] that enables the power exchange between\nthe two asynchronous grids using VFT. The duty cycle control\nblock is used to produce the duty cycle for the dc-dc converter.\n3) STAGE-3: CONTROL OF SERIES INVERTER\nThe reactive power produced by PG-1 is a straightforward\nfunction of reactive part of stator current (i 1,q) produced. This\ni1,q becomes zero only when there is no transfer of reactive\npower and this situation appears when v1,abc and v2,abc have\ntheir theoretical values and P1 =P2 ∼=0. However, when\ni1,q has its non-zero value, it demonstrates reactive power\ntransfer via VFT. Although, it can be regulated by controlling\nthe series injected voltages (v se,abc), which at the same time\nmodiﬁes the effectual grid voltage observed by VFT (v ′\n1,abc)\nusing the below expression,\nv′\n1,abc =v1,abc +vse,abc (4)\n105596 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. M. Khanet al.: Research on VFT: Smart Power Transmission Technology\nFIGURE 6. Simplified VFT park model for high power transmission.\nThe Unit template generator can be used to produce\n3-phase per-unit voltages (u 1,abc) which is having the same\nphase with v1,abc. Hence, the reference value of series injected\nvoltages (v∗\nse,abc) is produced using the below expression,\nv∗\nse,abc =|v se,abc|×u1,abc (5)\nThe controllers like proportional-resonant (PR) are\nrequired against error between the reference (v ∗\nse,abc) and\nabsolute (vse,abc) series injected voltages. This PR controllers\nin this particular application resonate at the fundamental\nfrequency of PG-1 (ω 1) achieved from the PLL, and thus\nfollows v∗\nse,abc. Similarly, mutual reactive power exchange\ncan be attained by framing the suitable per-unit value to i∗\n1,q.\nThis instantaneous restraint on the exchange of reactive\ncurrent via the VFT is determined by using the following\nrelation,\ni∗\n1,q ≤\n√\ni2\n1,rated −(i∗\n1,d )2\n|v∗\nse,abc|≤|v se,abc,rated | (6)\nIt seems quite interesting to consider the regulation of\neffective grid voltage observed by the VFT on the stator side\nis equally good, contrary to the voltage of the power system\nconnected on the rotor side.\nV. VFT CONFIGURATION FOR HIGH POWER EXCHANGE\nTo enhance the power rating of VFT, a technique called VFT\npark is proposed [90]. The VFT park enables the installation\nof various units of VFTs operating in parallel. In the VFT park\nmodel, each VFT unit is acquired with a wound rotor induc-\ntion machine (WRIM), coupling transformers, and capacitor\nbanks [91]. Fig. 6 shows the schematic arrangement of the\nVFT park model.\nVarious techniques have developed in the recent past\nfor evaluating the stability of VFT. Sequential continuation\nscheme and limit cycle are the most commonly used. How-\never, these methods demand the calculations of the stable\noperating point. The Limit cycle method determines the sta-\nble operating point of the VFT park. However, how sys-\ntem solutions differ by a particular parameter is determined\nusing a continuation scheme. A continuation scheme can be\nestablished using a sequential continuation. Determination\nof stability and instability regions requires the sequential\ncontinuation scheme depending on the limit cycle method and\nFloquet theory. The calculation of the stable operating point\nvia the limit cycle method enables effective stability studies.\nThe stable operating point of a 300 MW VFT park is cal-\nculated via the limit cycle method under different operating\nconditions [92]. The simulation results demonstrate that link\nthe rotor side of the VFT to the grid exhibits minor frequency\ndeviations.\nVI. BDFIM-BASED VFT SYSTEM\nBack-to-back HVDC systems with series compensation and\nVFT are the two alternatives to control the power exchange in\na weak interconnection [93]. However, simulations observed\nduring steady-state and fault conditions suggest that VFT\nis a greater contender to control the power exchange as a\nbidirectional asynchronous link between the two power grids.\nThe requirement of less reactive power, faster initial response\nunder fault conditions, and coherent damping along with\nreduced generations of harmonics are the attractive features\nof VFT.\nThe VFT is a DFIM-based system that has certain limita-\ntions, such as the presence of slip rings and brushes in the\nrotor circuit, which results in the increment of maintenance\ncost and abated life span [94]. To take care, the drawbacks\nimposed by DFIM, BDFIM is proposed [95]. Unlike VFT,\nthere are no slip rings and brushes, which consequently\nresults in lowering the losses and maintenance cost [96]. The\nstator of the BDFIM includes a pair of three-phase windings\nhaving a different number of pole pairs [97]. One of them\nis placed across the grid, hence named as power winding,\nsince it carries a major portion of the power. The second\none is linked via a bidirectional converter to the grid, and\nit is called the control winding since it carries only a minor\nportion of machine power. The rotor of the BDFIM includes\nspecially designed enclosed loops. In BDFIM, the real and\nthe reactive power of the power winding can be controlled by\ngoverning the magnitude, frequency, and phase sequence of\nthe applied voltage of the control winding [98]. Various con-\nﬁgurations of BDFIM have been reported in literature [99].\nBrushless duplex stator cascaded doubly-fed induction gener-\nator, Brushless doubly-fed induction generator with enclosed\ncage rotor, and Brushless doubly-fed induction generator with\nreluctance rotor. Brushless duplex stator cascaded doubly-fed\ninduction generator requires two separate wound rotor induc-\ntion machines, which consequently increases its size, com-\nplexity in speed control, and hence, cost [100].\nThe BDFIM with an enclosed cage rotor offers reliabil-\nity and zero maintenance operation, making it suitable for\nVOLUME 9, 2021 105597\nM. M. Khanet al.: Research on VFT: Smart Power Transmission Technology\nbulk power transmission. A BDFIM with an enclosed cage\nrotor offers alternatives against DFIM in various applica-\ntions such as; adjustable speed drive for big size induction\nmachines [101], wind applications [102], and non-contact\npower delivery systems [103]. However, it imposes increased\nlosses, poor efﬁciency, and complexity in control due to\ncomplexity in rotor design. Moreover, a BDFIM, with a\nreluctance rotor, can counter the various drawbacks discussed\nabove while retaining their beneﬁts. But for weak networks,\nit may cause increased inverter rating [99]. Moreover, it also\nrequires a complex rotor design. The BDFIM can become\nan alternative for asynchronous interconnection but requires\nspecial machine construction, which increases its complexity\nand as well as the size of the machine.\nVII. DFIM THEORY AND OPERATION\nThe DFIM has a pair of three-phase windings accommodated\nin the stator and the rotor. Unlike conventional induction\nmachines, the rotor circuit is not short-circuited, and the stator\nand rotor circuit is energized independently through brushes\nand slip rings arrangement, which enables the star as well as\ndelta connection for rotor circuit [104]–[106].\nThe DFIM is very similar to a cage rotor type induction\nmachine, but there is a slight difference in construction like;\nthe rotor is larger for DFIM, which also requires routine\ncare over unavoidable degradation of brushes and slip rings\nassembly. The stator includes a set of three-phase windings\n120 degrees apart in space and having p pairs of poles.\nAs soon as these three-phase windings are energized using\na balanced three-phase voltage source having frequency f1,\ndue to which ﬂux is induced in the stator, which rotates at a\nconstant speed. This ﬂux also interacts with the rotor circuit\nand induces an emf across rotor three-phase windings. This\ninduced voltage, along with the externally supplied voltage\nhaving frequency f2 through brushes, a current is induced\nthrough rotor three-phase windings. This induced current\nleads to an induced force in the rotor of DFIM. The angular\nfrequency of the induced current in the rotor circuit is deﬁned\nas [107]:\nω2 =ω1 −ωm (7)\nω1 is the angular frequency of the voltages and currents\nof the stator three-phase windings (rad/s), ω2 is the angular\nfrequency of the voltages and currents of the rotor three-phase\nwindings (rad/s), ωm is the angular frequency of the rotor\n(rad/s), f1 is the electrical frequency of grid-connected on\nthe stator side (Hz), and f2 is the electrical frequency of\ngrid-connected on the rotor side (Hz).\nUnder normal operating conditions (steady-state), ω2 is the\nangular frequency of rotor winding voltage and current due to\ninduction, and the externally supplied voltage across the rotor\nwinding should also have ω2 angular frequency. Hence, slip\ns is deﬁned as [108]:\ns =ω1 −ωm\nω1\n=ω2\nω1\n(8)\nFIGURE 7. Equivalent circuit of DFIM. (a) Steady-state. (b) Thevenin’s\nequivalent. (c) Thevenin’s equivalent circuit of VFT based system.\nFrom above expressions:\nω2 =sω1 (9)\nEquivalent relation between frequencies is:\nf2 =sf1 (10)\nIf applied frequencies of both sides are identical\n(f1 = f2), in such a case, slip s becomes unity and rotor\ndoes not move and hence, DFIM appears as a non-rotating\ntype transformer [109]. Moreover, the capacity to alter the\noffset location of the rotor coil with the stator coil is present\ndue to the DC motor drive. This enables the adjustment in\nimpedance of the transformer. When the applied frequencies\nof the two sides are unequal, there exist slip s and the rotor\nrotates at a speed that is a direct function of the difference\nbetween the stator and rotor side frequency.\nA. ANALYSIS FOR POWER FLOW CONTROL\nFor calculating active and reactive power transfer via VFT,\na steady-state equivalent circuit of VFT based system referred\nto the stator side is shown in Fig. 7. The terms V, I, R, X,\nZ, and s represent the voltage, current, resistance, reactance,\nimpedance, and slip, respectively. While subscripts 1 and\n2 denote the stator and rotor side values, respectively, and\nsuperscript ′denotes the quantities of rotor side when referred\nto stator side. It seems quite interesting to further simplify the\ncircuit of Fig. 7 (a) by Thevenin’s equivalent circuit at points\nAB [110], [111].

Hence, the equivalent circuit\nof Fig. 7 (b) is further re-drawn in Fig. 7 (c) to certainly\ndemonstrate the entire VFT based system containing the dc\nmotor drive as well.

SIMULATION STUDIES OF VFT SYSTEM\nThe two AC power systems (PS-1 and PS-2) having oper-\nating frequencies of 60 Hz and 50 Hz, respectively, are\ninterconnected via the VFT to exchange the power as shown\nin Fig. 8. It is simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software.\nPower System-1 (PS-1) and Power System-2 (PS-2) ratings\nare 240 MV A, 230 kV , 60 Hz, and 240 MV A, 230 kV , 50 Hz,\nrespectively. The rating of VFT is 200 MV A, 20 kV . It is con-\nsidered that the real power ﬂows from PS-1 to PS-2. Hence,\nPS-1 is the sending end while PS-2 is the receiving end.\nThe PS-1 is connected to the stator side of VFT via circuit\nbreaker-1 and 230/20 kV transformer, while the PS-2 is tied\nto the rotor side of VFT via circuit breaker-2 and 230/20 kV\ntransformer. A load of 100 MW, 230 kV is also connected\nacross the two ends. Overall system response is assessed\nboth under steady-state and fault conditions keeping torque\nconstant at 0.95 pu. The duration of the simulation is 20 s.\nA. STEADY-STATE SIMULATION\nThe simulation begins with the closing of circuit breaker-1,\nwhich energizes the stator side of the VFT at an instant of\nt =0.5 s thereby, connecting PS-1. Later, the rotor side\nof the VFT is also energized at an instant of t =1.0 s\nthereby, connecting PS-2. The simulated results of the\nthree-phase sending end voltage and current are presented\nin Fig. 9 (a) and Fig. 9 (b), respectively. The simulated results\nof the three-phase receiving end (RE) voltage and current\nare presented in the Fig. 9 (c) and Fig. 9 (d), respectively.\nThe value of steady-state active power at the sending end\nand receiving end are 215 MW and 200 MW, respectively,\nas depicted in Fig. 9 (e). The reactive power exchange for both\nsending end and receiving end are demonstrated in Fig. 9 (f).\nFinally, the variation of active power with respect to torque in\nthe VFT is illustrated in Fig. 10.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 105599\nM.

The simulated results of the three-phase receiv-\ning end voltage and current are presented in Fig. 11 (c) and\nFig. 11 (d), respectively. It is evident from Fig. 11 (b) that the\nsending end current of the faulty phase overshoots during the\nfault period and after clearance of the fault settles to its normal\nvalue. It is also illustrated from Fig. 11 (a) that the sending\nend voltage of the faulty phase dips during the fault period\nFIGURE 10.

Moreover, the LG\nfault on the sending end has also an impact on the receiving\nend current (Fig. 11 (d)) as the receiving end current distorts\nduring the fault, and ﬁnally settles to its normal value after\nthe removal of the fault. However, the receiving end voltage\nis completely unaffected. During the LG fault on the sending\nend, active power experiences a dip of about 23 MW at the\nsending end and a comparatively smaller dip of about 20 MW\nat the receiving end as depicted in Fig. 11 (e). Once the fault is\nover, the sending end’s active power is restored to its normal\nvalue of 215 MW, while the active power transferred at the\nreceiving end is also restored to its normal value of 200 MW\nas depicted in Fig. 11 (e). The reactive power exchange\nfor both sending end and receiving end are demonstrated\nin Fig. 11 (f). Therefore, the performance of the system is\nacceptable during LG fault on the sending end as the healthy\nside remains practically lesser affected.\n2) DOUBLE-LINE FAULT ON SENDING END\nThe double-line (LL) fault takes place at PS-1 (Fig. 8).\nThe fault duration is 0.05 s (fault evolved at an instant t =\n10.0 s and removed at an instant t =10.05 s).

The reactive power exchange for both sending\nend and receiving end are demonstrated in Fig. 12 (f). There-\nfore, the performance of the system is acceptable during LL\nfault on the sending end.\n3) DOUBLE-LINE TO GROUND FAULT ON SENDING END\nThe double-line to ground (LLG) fault takes place at PS-1\n(Fig. 8). The fault duration is 0.05 s (fault evolved at an\ninstant t =10.0 s and removed at an instant t =10.05 s). The\nsimulated results of the three-phase sending end voltage and\ncurrent are presented in Fig. 13 (a) and Fig. 13 (b), respec-\ntively. The simulated results of the three-phase receiving end\nvoltage and current are presented in Fig. 13 (c) and Fig. 13 (d),\nrespectively. It is evident from Fig. 13 (b) that the sending end\ncurrent of the faulty phases overshoot during the fault, and\nafter clearance of the fault settles to its normal values.

However, the receiving end voltage is completely\nunaffected. During the LLG fault on the sending end, active\npower experiences dip of about 45 MW at the sending end and\nabout 29 MW at the receiving end as depicted in Fig. 13 (e).\nVOLUME 9, 2021 105601\nM.

The fault duration is 0.05 s (fault evolved at an instant\nt =10.0 s and removed at an instant t =10.05 s). The simu-\nlated results of the three-phase sending end voltage and cur-\nrent are represented in Fig. 14 (a) and Fig. 14 (b), respectively.\nThe simulated results of the three-phase receiving end voltage\nand current are represented in Fig. 14 (c) and Fig. 14 (d),\nrespectively. It is apparent from Fig. 14 (b) that the sending\nend current of the faulty phases overshoot during the fault,\nand after clearance of the fault settles to its normal values. It is\nalso illustrated from Fig. 14 (a) that the sending end voltage\nof the faulty phases dip during the fault period and after\nthe clearance of the fault, sending end voltage of the faulty\nphases also regain its normal values. Moreover, the LLLG\nfault on the sending end has also an impact on the receiving\nend current (Fig. 14 (d)) as the receiving end current distorts\nduring the fault, and ﬁnally settles to its normal value after\nthe removal of the fault. However, the receiving end voltage is\ncompletely unaffected. During the LLLG fault on the sending\nend, active power experiences dip of about 65 MW at the\nsending end and about 35 MW at the receiving end as depicted\nin Fig. 14 (e). Once the fault is over, the sending end’s active\npower is restored to its normal value of 215 MW, while the\nactive power transferred at the receiving end is also restored\nto its normal value of 200 MW as depicted in Fig. 14 (e). The\nreactive power exchange for both sending end and receiving\nend are demonstrated in Fig. 14 (f). Therefore, the perfor-\nmance of the system is acceptable during LLLG fault on the\nsending end as the healthy side remains practically lesser\naffected.\nIX. CONCLUSION\nA detailed review of asynchronous grid interconnection is\ncarried out to evaluate a broad perspective on the different\ntechnologies proposed so far. These technologies are com-\npared against each other with their corresponding merits and\nconstraints. The VFT is found to be a better alternative for\npower transfer in a weak AC interconnection over the back-\nto-back HVDC link. Moreover, a comparison of the VFT with\ntraditional back-to-back HVDC link is also carried out which\nsuggests VFT a leading innovation over classical technology.\nMoreover, the VFT suppresses the power oscillations in the\ninterconnected networks due to its inherent damping ability.\nThus, it prevents cascaded tripping, the spread of effects, and\ngrid failure of the other healthy networks. For high power\nexchange, the VFT park model is a better alternative where\nthe calculation of the stable operating point via the limit\ncycle method offers adequate stability studies. To eliminate\nthe periodic maintenance of slip rings and brushes, a BDFIM\nbased VFT system is proposed, which retains all the beneﬁts\nof the DFIM-based VFT system. Moreover, the performance\nof VFT is evaluated using mathematical modeling and simu-\nlation analysis under both steady-state and various fault con-\nditions using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The performance of\nthe VFT during steady-state and various fault conditions is\nfound to be satisfactory. The simulation results prove VFT\nan acceptable option for asynchronous interconnection. The\nperformance of the VFT is satisfactory as the healthy side\nremains less affected during fault conditions, and the fault\ncurrent remains reasonably low. It is expected that this paper\nwill work as a helpful reference for researchers and designers\ndealing with asynchronous interconnection.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. M. Elavarasan, G. Shaﬁullah, S.
