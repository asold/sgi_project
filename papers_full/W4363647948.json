    "abstract": "Gait recognition, the task of identifying an individual based on their unique walking style, can be difficult because walking styles can be influenced by external factors such as clothing, viewing angle, and carrying conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-model gait recognition system that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer. The first step in the process is to obtain a gait energy image, which is achieved by applying an averaging technique to a gait cycle. The gait energy image is then fed into three different models, DenseNet-201, VGG-16, and a Vision Transformer. These models are pre-trained and fine-tuned to encode the salient gait features that are specific to an individual’s walking style. Each model provides prediction scores for the classes based on the encoded features, and these scores are then summed and averaged to produce the final class label. The performance of this multi-model gait recognition system was evaluated on three datasets, CASIA-B, OU-ISIR dataset D, and OU-ISIR Large Population dataset. The experimental results showed substantial improvement compared to existing methods on all three datasets. The integration of CNNs and ViT allows the system to learn both the pre-defined and distinct features, providing a robust solution for gait recognition even under the influence of covariates.",
