In managing infectious diseases, a field marked by complex \nepidemiological and clinical challenges, AI's potential role is notably significant (4–\n6). \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and generative-AI Large Language Models \n(LLM) are emerging as crucial yet underexplored tools in this domain (7–9). These \nalgorithms excel at analyzing and generating text in a human-like manner, an essential \ncapability for interpreting intricate clinical data (8–12). \nThe current landscape in the literature shows a mixed picture. While there are studies \ndemonstrating AI's potential to innovate in diagnosis and treatment planning, there is \nalso a noticeable fragmentation in research efforts (2,4,5,10,13,14). This scenario \npoints to both the achievements and the overlooked possibilities in AI applications, \nespecially in the field of infectious diseases. \nOur research focuses on exploring the current use of NLP and LLM in the field of \ninfectious diseases, aiming to uncover areas where further exploration could \nsignificantly enhance diagnosis and prediction capabilities. \n \n \nMethods  \nSearch Strategy \n .

We \nadhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses \n(PRISMA) guidelines (15,16).  \nA systematic search was conducted across key databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of \nScience, and Scopus, up until December 2023. We complemented the search via \nreference screening for any additional papers.  \nWe aimed to identify original research articles that investigated the application of \nNLP and LLM in the diagnosis or prediction of infectious diseases.  \nThe search utilized a combination of keywords including \"infectious diseases\", \n\"infection\", \"LLM\", \"Large Language Mode\", \"AI\", \"Artificial Intelligence\", \"natural \nlanguage processing\", and \"NLP\". Specific search strings for each database are \ndetailed in the supplementary materials. \nStudy Selection \nWe included original research articles that focused on the application of NLP and \nLLM in diagnosing or predicting infectious diseases.  \nStudies were selected if they provided data for assessing the performance metrics of \nAI models, such as area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. \nWe excluded review papers, case reports, conference abstracts, editorials, preprints, \nand studies not conducted in English. We also excluded studies employing classic \nmachine-learning techniques unrelated to NLP. \nData Extraction \n .

(which was not certified by peer review)\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 17, 2024. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.14.24301289doi: medRxiv preprint \nTwo independent reviewers extracted relevant information using a standardized form. \nData points included the first author's name, year of publication, study design, sample \nsize, specific conversational NLP techniques used, dataset details for model training \nand validation, performance metrics, and key findings. Discrepancies between \nreviewers were resolved through discussion, and a third reviewer was consulted when \nnecessary. \nRisk of Bias \nTo evaluate the quality and robustness of the methodologies in the included studies, \nthe QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) tool was \nused (17). \n \n \nResults  \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI Models \nNatural Language Processing (NLP), a vital part of AI, enables machines to \nunderstand and interpret human language text (7). Within this domain, generative AI \nmodels, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), are gaining prominence (10,18). \nThese models are designed to generate text that closely resembles human writing, \nproviding valuable insights and applications. \nAmong the notable LLMs are Bidirectional Encoder Representations from \nTransformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). BERT is \nparticularly effective at grasping the context within language, allowing for more \naccurate interpretations of text (19). On the other hand, GPT stands out for its ability \n .

Specifically, the search resulted in 177 \narticles from PubMed, 52 from Embase, 68 from Web of Science, and 135 from \nScopus.  \nAfter the removal of 143 duplicates, the screening process found 13 studies that met \nour inclusion and exclusion criteria (19,21–32). We identified two additional studies \nvia reference screening (33,34).  \nThese studies varied in their disease focus, underscoring the diverse applications of \nNLP and LLM in the field of infectious diseases.  \nThe process of study selection and the screening methodology are detailed in the \nPRISMA flow chart (Figure 3). \nRisk of Bias \nSix studies demonstrated a low risk of bias across all domains (21,31–35). Overall, \nten studies were evaluated as having low risk (21–23,26,28,31–35), four showed high \nrisk (19,24,27,29), and one lacked sufficient data for a conclusive risk assessment \n(30).  \nGenerally, the studies indicated a predominantly low risk of bias, suggesting reliable \nand valid results (Figures 4-5). Concerning applicability, most of the studies \n .

However, specific concerns were raised in a few studies, \nparticularly regarding their study populations. Several studies used specialized \npopulations, such as patients with hematologic neoplasms or data derived from \nspecific databases, which may limit generalizability (25–29,35).  \nOverview of Included Studies \nThe included studies were published between 2005 and 2023 and present a \ncomprehensive view of the evolving use of NLP and LLM in diagnosing and \nmanaging infectious diseases. The studies focused on various diseases, including \nfungal infections in immunocompromised patients, respiratory infections in newborns, \nHIV, Lyme disease, and COVID-19. These studies utilized different data sources such \nas radiology and histopathology reports, clinical data from medical files, and social \nmedia posts (e.g., tweets). Notably, two studies tested ChatGPT-4, two studies \nutilized BERT, while others employed a variety of NLP models. This showcases the \nevolving landscape of AI applications in infectious diseases.  \nNotably, Maillard et al. and Perret and Schmid et al. utilized GPT-4 to analyze \nbloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections, respectively \n(31,35). They demonstrated the potential of AI in clinical decision-making despite \ncertain limitations.  \nBaggio et al. and Ananda-Rajah et al. employed machine learning-based NLP to \nenhance the surveillance of invasive mold diseases (22,27,30).  \nAdditionally, studies like Feller et al. and Boligarla et al. explored innovative \napplications of\n  NLP in risk assessment and disease surveillance using diverse data \nsources, including clinical notes and social media (25,26).  \n .

(which was not certified by peer review)\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 17, 2024. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.14.24301289doi: medRxiv preprint \nThese studies collectively underscore the significant advancements and potential of \nNLP in infectious disease research, while also highlighting areas for improvement and \nfurther exploration (Table 1). \nNarrative Synthesis of AI and NLP in Infectious Diseases  \nDiagnosis and patient management  \nIn comparing the effectiveness of NLP and LLM in infectious disease management, \nthe results show varied outcomes. GPT-4, as used in Maillard et al.'s and Perret and \nSchmid et al.'s studies (31,35), demonstrated high accuracy in catheter-associated \nurinary tract infections (CAUTI) detection. However, the model showed moderated \neffectiveness in bloodstream infection management.  \nNLP algorithms in the studies by Branch-Elliman et al. and Sanger et al. showed high \nsensitivity and specificity for CAUTI detection (33,34). This indicates their strong \npotential for precise medical surveillance and diagnosis. \nNLP in Disease Monitoring from Medical Reports \nNLP demonstrated high effectiveness in pneumonia and invasive mold disease \ndetection. For instance, the MedLEE model achieved up to 99% specificity in \npneumonia detection (28). In Baggio et al, an NLP classifier showed 91% sensitivity \nin identifying invasive mold diseases from CT reports (30). These results underline \nNLP's promising role in disease surveillance.  \nPublic Health Surveillance \nSeveral studies revealed NLP's effectiveness in health monitoring.  \nFor example, BERTweet model was used for Lyme Disease detection through social \nmedia tweets (25). BERTweet, analyzing 1.3 million tweets, reached 90% accuracy. \n .

Public Health Surveillance: Tools like BERTweet are effective in tracking \ndisease epidemiology through social media analysis. \n2. Diagnostic Accuracy: NLP shows high accuracy in disease detection from \nmedical reports. This could be helpful for incidence monitoring and for aiding \ndiagnoses (Table 2). \n3. Clinical Applications: NLP and LLM have versatile use cases: disease \nmonitoring, risk assessment, pandemic prevention, and prediction, and aiding \nclinical decisions (Table 3).  \n \n \nDiscussion \n . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a \n is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 17, 2024. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.14.24301289doi: medRxiv preprint \nThe integration of NLP and LLM in the management of infectious diseases holds \nthe promise for a paradigm shift in medical diagnostics and public health \nsurveillance (20,36–39). Our systematic review reveals a landscape where the \npotential of these technologies is only beginning to be tapped. \nFirstly, the implementation of NLP and LLM in infectious diseases showcases a \nleap forward in medical technology's ability to process and interpret complex \nclinical data (1,2,36,37). The precision in disease detection, as illustrated by \nstudies on CAUTI and pneumonia, underscores the capability of AI to augment \nhuman expertise in diagnostic processes (23,24,33–35). However, the variation in \neffectiveness across different infectious diseases highlights the nuanced nature of \nAI applications in healthcare. For instance, a study by Wilhelm et al. on various \nConversational AI models across different medical specialties like ophthalmology, \northopedics, and dermatology, found significant differences in the quality and \nsafety of the medical advice provided (40). Furthermore, research by Maillard and \ncolleagues revealed that GPT-4 occasionally produces incorrect and, at times, \ndetrimental medical guidance and treatment strategies (31). It is not a one-size-\nfits-all solution but requires tailored approaches depending on the disease context. \nSecondly, the use of AI in public health surveillance, as evidenced by the \nBERTweet model for Lyme Disease and the eCOV model for COVID-19, is a \nbreakthrough (19,24,32). These tools demonstrate how AI can transform \nunstructured data from diverse sources into actionable insights, a critical \nadvancement for early outbreak detection and response. \nThirdly, the evolution of AI in risk assessment and predictive analytics marks a \nsignificant stride. Models like the HIV risk assessment tool and CHESS show that \n .

The variability in \nstudy methodologies and the limited focus of some studies on specific patient \npopulations or diseases indicate that generalizability remains a concern. The \ndependency on the quality and completeness of clinical data for AI models \nunderscores the need for robust data infrastructure in healthcare settings. For \nexample, a lack of contextual awareness and inherent biases may sometimes \nhinder AI safe deployment in clinical settings, as reported by Schwartz et al (5).  \nFurthermore, the nascent stage of LLM application in infectious diseases, as seen \nin the limited number of studies, suggests that we are only scratching the surface \nof what these technologies can achieve (10,20,36).  \nLimitations \nOur study faces several limitations. The emerging nature of LLM in healthcare \nresearch means that there are relatively few studies specifically focusing on this \ntechnology, limiting our ability to draw comprehensive conclusions. The immense \npotential of LLM necessitates more extensive research to fully understand its \ncapabilities and limitations. Additionally, the predominance of retrospective \nstudies in our review indicates a need for more prospective studies to validate the \nfindings (41). Lastly, the diverse methodologies and focus areas of the included \nstudies prevented us from performing a meta-analysis, highlighting the need for \nmore standardized research approaches in this field. \nConclusion \nThis review highlights the yet-to-be-fully-realized promise of NLP and LLMs in \n .
