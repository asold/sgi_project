INTRODUCTION\nHE development of low carbon technologies (e.g., \ngeneration and utilization of renewables), challenges the \nmodern electricity grids performances in terms of the stability, \npower quality and reliability[1], [2 ]. Thus, the update of grid \nassets, advanced monitoring and control techniques are needed \nto improve the electricity grid  performances, and to further \nincrease the penetration of renewables [3]–[5].  \nThe solid-state-transformer-based smart transformer (ST) \nwas proposed to effectively solve the aforementioned \nchallenges caused by high penetration of renewables in the \ndistribution electricity grids, due to the advanced control \nfunctions and the provision of dc connectivity as well [3]. \nMoreover, the ST represents a new semi-centralized scheme to \navoid extreme decentralization caused by the high penetration \nof power electronics-interfaced (PEI) distributed energy \nresources (DERs).  \nThe design of the hardware architecture (e.g. topology, \nbuilding blocks, component sizing) of the ST is determined by \nthe services that the ST should provide to the grid [6].The three-\nstage configuration of the ST offers dc connectivity, which \nmakes the ST an active, multi-port node, allowing for e.g., \nstorage integration [7] and meshed, hybrid grid operation [8]. \nThe meshed reconfiguration of the grid can help to increase the \nrenewable energy sources (RES) share, while keeping the grid \nexpansion effort low and the quality of power supply high.  \nIn order to operate the ST in a proper way, the ST is \ncontrolled either in grid-forming (GFM) or in grid-following \n(GFL) mode, according to the network structure and the \nrequired grid supports. In comparison, besides the different \nsynchronization mechanism, the GFM operation of ST \nemulates the synchronous machine behavior while the GFL \noperation is suitable for high current quality applications. \nIn grid applications, the ST can effectively control the power \nflow in either the radial networks or meshed and hybrid \nnetworks, where the optimal power flow control can avoid high \nvoltage violation, high line losses and overload of grid assets. \nBased on the included power conversion stages, the ST can also \nprovide a full decoupling of the medium voltage (MV) and low \nvoltage (LV) side grids frequencies. Such frequency \ndecoupling can have an important role regarding the possibility \nof exploiting power-frequency droop-based controllers in LV-\nconnected generators or specific loads (as for example electric \nvehicle (EV)-chargers) in order to locally promote some form \nof generation-load balancing [9]. Moreover, some coordination \nstrategies between the LV an d MV side frequency can be \nenvision alongside a ST in order to allow LV-connected \nresources to actively respond to frequency events occurring in \nthe upstream grid [9]. \nOne of the new characteristics caused by high penetration of \nPEI resources in the electricity grids is the harmonic interaction, \nwhich degrades the power quality (voltage and current) of the \nelectricity grids [1], arises resonant issues and reduces stability \nmargin [10]. The output impedance of ST may be higher than \nthe conventional power transformer (CPT), because the \nswitching characteristics of the power converter in ST requires \nan output filter to suppress the switching harmonics. The higher \noutput impedance is the main reason to cause the power quality \nissues [11]. The resonant and stability issues are caused by both \nthe impedance gain and phase characteristics of the \ninterconnected systems, according to the impedance-based \nstability criterion. These issues can be solved by improving the \ncontrol schemes of the interfaced power converters of DERs, \nbut such solution results in the customized function of the \nDERs potentially increasing the cost and moreover the \neffectiveness is degraded in case of the change of grid operating \nconditions caused by the continuous increase penetration of \nDERs. Thus, the effective control solutions implemented inside \nthe ST instead of the DERs to improve the power quality [11] \nand to stabilize [10] the grid will be presented in this paper. \nSmart Transformer/Large Flexible Transformer \nRongwu Zhu, Member, IEEE, Markus Andresen, Member, IEEE, Marius Langwasser, Student \nMember, IEEE, Marco Liserre, Fellow, IEEE, Joao Pecas Lopes, Fellow, IEEE, Carlos Moreira, \nJustino Rodrigues, and Mario Couto \nT \nManuscript received August 11, 2020; Revised October 22, 2020; \nAccepted November 19, 2020.

The dc connectivity \nprovided to integrate a local energy storage system (ESS), \ntogether with the flexibility to operate its power conversion \nstages in GFM or GFL modes is fundamental in order to enable \nautonomous operation mode of a multi-microgrid through a \n(fleet of) ST. Moreover, the ESS envisioned to exist in future \nactive distribution grids together with locally available DERs \nallows to properly coordinate a service restoration stage at the \nMV and LV level in case a general blackout occurs. Both \noperation modes are key contributions within the scope of \nincreasing distribution grid resilience. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The voltage \nand current source inverter-bas ed architectures and their \npossibility to enable an active node for ac, dc and hybrid grid \noperation in radial and meshed network are briefly introduced \nin Section II. The control mode of ST in GFL and GFM \noperation, which allows the ST to be equivalent to a slack bus, \nP and Q bus, is studied in Section III. The ST provided \nadvanced services in terms of power flow control, power \nquality improvement, active damping, frequency support and \nblack start functions are studied in Section IV. Section V \nconcludes this paper. \nII. GENERAL ARCHITECTURE \nA. Hardware Solutions \nSeveral authors proposed topologies for STs and several \nreviews grouped them by cert ain characteristics, like power \nconversion stages or the adopted converter architecture \n[12],[13]. The installation of the ST in the electricity grid is \nmotivated by the services it can provide. Therefore, the \nhardware needs to be designed in such a way that it meets the \nrequirements of the grid operator as well as the grid conditions. \nThese parameters are commonly power system related and may \nbe related to parameters such as: \n•DC-connectivity and DC voltage range \n•Efficiency \n•Power quality \n•Voltage range of the connected ac grids \n•P/Q characteristics \n•Grid synchronization dynamics \n•Maximum space \n•etc. \nSeveral of these parameters are linked to the design of the \nsystem and compliance with certain requirements may be easier \nfor certain topologies than for others. Therefore, the \nrequirements need to be translat ed into the design of the ST \nhardware. This covers the following aspects: \n•Topology choice \n•System modularity including the number of building blocks \n•Component sizing \n•Control system \n•Grid synchronization algorithm \n•etc. \n \nFig. 1.  Three-stage ST topology. \n \n \nFig. 2.  ST topology of the S4T. \nAs a practical example, a transformer substation shall be \nreplaced by an ST, which shall providedc-connectivity and \nneeds to fit the space where the substation was installed before. \nConsequently, a medium frequency transformer is needed due \nto the space requirements an d the dc-connectivity, which \nexcludes several possible ST architectures. Nevertheless, there \nis still a large range of possibilities: As an example, a three-\nstage ST is shown in Fig. 1, which is commonly referred to be \nmost flexible for providing services. This topology has two dc \nconnections for connecting ESSs or possibly dc-grids. This \nenables direct control of the grid voltage profile [7]. \nMoreover, the topology affects the required volume of the \nsystem by means of the selected modularity and the frequency \nof the isolation stage. For the three-stage ST topology the most \ncommon use case is the operation of the LV side converter in \nGFM, the isolation stage in LVdc control and the MV side in \nGFL.  \nThe component sizing determines the power transfer \ncapability of the grid and therefore a possible margin for a \nfuture load increase, overload capability and the maximum \noutput voltage for controlling transients. As it has been \npresented in [6], the sizing even impacts the potential for \nproviding services. For ensuring low losses during operation, \nthe target efficiency shall also be determined. In addition power \nquality related measures like the Total Harmonic Distortion \n(THD) of the output voltage (in GFM operation) or the output \ncurrent (in GFL operation) shall be defined. This point will be \nexamined in Section III A. Remarkably, the output voltage \nrange is another important measure to provide the demanded \nvoltage control range, which may be required to ride through \nfaults without disconnecting the grid. \nExamples for ST topologies ar e examined in [3], where the \ntopologies have been grouped by the number of power \nconversion stages. Moreover, the modularity is discussed and \nsolutions range from monolithic solutions to modular solutions \nwith a high number of building blocks. As an example for a \nsingle stage ST, the S4T topology is shown in Fig. 2. The S4T \nis a current source based converter topology [14], which has \nsignificant less components in comparison to commonly \n\n266 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nproposed modular voltage source converter topologies. \nRemarkable differences are the simple fault handling capability \nof the S4T, because of the cu rrent source topology with few \nbidirectional power semiconductors in contrast to the high \nnumber of building blocks and transformers. \nB. An Active Node Connecting AC to DC Grids \nThe ST enables to interconnect multiple ac and dc grids. As \ninherently stated in a commonly used description of the ST, \nEnergy Router, a key functionality is the energy flow control. \nThis means, the ST can in contrast to a CPT-control the active \nand the reactive power exchange with the connected grids. This \nenables to obtain an intelligent node, scaling up to a system \nwith multiple intelligent nodes in the grid. \n \nFig. 3 ST-enabled configurations of a meshed hybrid distribution grid. \nTwo architectures are commonly used to build the MV side \nac/dc converter of the ST. The MMC-based architecture, which \nin contrast to the CHB one, is a truly multiport architecture and \noffers an additional MV dc port. However, this comes at the \ncosts of an increased number of cells and semiconductor \ndevices. \nIn the configuration to interconnect ac and dc grids, \ncommonly meshed grids are obtained, which provide high \npotential for reduced grid reinfo rcements or operation with \nreduced losses. However, the control and the protection remain \nchallenging [8]. In general, a meshed grid refers to a system, in \nwhich each grid node is supplied from at least two sides, \nallowing for advanced power flow control by means of the ST. \nAs shown in Fig. 3 the ST enables the meshed hybrid \ndistribution grid in four different configurations. The first \noption (shown in orange) is to connect two parallel feeders(e.g. \none ST-fed and one fed by CPT) at the low voltage ac busbar. \nThis allows for equal distribution of the load power demand \namong the feeders and significantly improves the appliances \noverload condition and feeder voltage profile [8]. Similar \nbenefits can be obtained, if the grid is reconfigured to a ring \ngrid by closing the normally open point (NOP) at the end of the \nLV feeders (shown in red in Fig. 3). \nThe growing amount of DERs and ESS units increases the \nnumber of power conversion stages in the grid. The use of \nmultiport ST facilitates the integration of these devices and can \nhelp to keep the grid infrastructure light, providing advanced \nservices in both ac and dc grids. In [15], the use of an extra \nLVdc line is proposed, which interconnects the ST LVdc link \nwith the dc bus of distributed generation converters and dc \nloads (highlighted in green in Fig. 3). Several active power flow \npaths are made available through this architecture, such that the \nactive power supply is near to the load points and is drawn from \nST, only in times where the DERs are absent. This reduces the \nsize of the ST’s LV ac/dc converter, improves the utilization of \nDERs converter and ensures reverse power flow at higher \nefficiency. In [16], a novel interconnected design of a multiport \nST is proposed to further increase the efficiency in the meshed \nhybrid ac and dc grid. \nAs fourth option, in a scenario  with two distinct MV grid \nwith different supply structure, i.e. one DG-dominated and one \nload-dominated, the MVdc links of two ST can be coupled via \nan additional MVdc line (in blue in Fig. 3). This improves the \nsupply redundancy and provides the possibility to fulfill the \npower demand of the two MV feeders by a single storage unit \nin case of grid fault emergency. \nIII. CONTROL OF ST  \nAccording to the control scheme and corresponding physical \nmechanism, the operation of ST can be defined as GFL and \nGFM mode, with the equivalent physical models as shown in \nFig. 4. \nA. Control of ST in GFL Operation \nIn the GFL mode, the ST is controlled as a current source to \ninject a controllable current into the electricity grid. The phase \nangle information of grid voltage at the connected point of the \nST is needed in order to decouple the active and reactive \ncomponent of the injected cu rrent accurately, and various \nphase-locked-loop (PLL) techniques were proposed in \nliterature to detect the grid voltage phase information, as shown \nin Fig. 4(a). \n \nFig. 4.  Equivalent circuit of the ST operating in (a) GFL and (b) GFM. \nThe detailed control block diagram of ST operating in GFL \nmode is shown in Fig. 5, where Gi is the current  controller, GLf \nis the transfer function of  the ac filter inductor, GCf is the \ntransfer function of the ac filter capacitor, Gd is the transfer \nfunction of delay. \nThe current reference, i∗, can be computed by the active and \n\nZHU et al: SMART TRANSFORMER/LARGE FLEXIBLE TRANSFORMER 267 \nreactive power reference, p∗ and q∗, directly, \n''** * **\n,dq p qii i C p q                              (1) \nwhere ,\n2 10\n013\npq\nd\nC u  , subscripts “d” and “q” represent the \nd- and q-axis component in the synchronization reference \nframe. \n \nFig. 5.  Control block diagram of GFL operation. \nB.  Control of ST in GFM operation \nIn the GFM mode, the ST is controlled as a voltage source, \nas shown in Fig. 4(b). The active and reactive power are \ncontrolled by adjusting output voltage amplitude and phase \nangle of the ST, with respect to power synchronization \nmechanism, when the line is more inductive. Based on the two \nsources model as shown in Fig. 6, the active and reactive power \nflow at the receiving end can be obtained as: \n\n\nU Ecos U cos EUsin sinp z\nEUsin cos U Ecos U sinq z\n  \n  \n\n\n                    (2) \nwhere p and q are the active and reactiv e power, respectively, \nE and δ are the amplitude and angle of voltage at the sending \nend, U is the voltage amplitude at the receiving end, z and β are \nthe amplitude and angle of line impedance. \n \nFig. 6 Model of two-source system. \nIn (2), the active and reactive power are coupled with voltage \namplitude and angle. Genera lly, they are approximately \ndecoupled with respect to the x/r ratio of power line (q →f(δ) \nand p→v for resistive lines, and p→f(δ) and q→v for inductive \nlines). It is assumed that the line is inductive for the study in \nthis paper. \nThe motion/droop characteristic of the GFM in Fig. 4(b) is \nderived by emulating the conventional synchronous generators. \nThe swing equation of conventional synchronous generators is \nshown as, \n \no\nin o\ndpp J D dt\n                 (3) \nwhere pin is the input power, ωo is the synchronous frequency, \nω is the grid operating frequency, J is the inertia, D is the \ndamping coefficient. \nDue to the assumption of only inductive line, β=π/2, and \nlinearizing (2) and (3) at the equilibrium points δo, ωo and po, it \ncan be obtained that, \n         \n              \ndpJ D dt\nEUp z\n \n\n \n\n                        (4) \nwhere ∆ represents the increment. The reactive power in (2) can \nbe further simplified as, \n2UE Uq z\n                                 (5) \nSimilarly, when a voltage droop is used, the “q-v” \ncharacteristic is obtained as, \nv\ndE UEqT dt z\n  \n                        (6) \nwhere Tv is the time constant of voltage droop.  \nBased on (3), (4), (5) and (6), the control block diagram of \nthe GFM inverter is shown in Fig. 7(a), in which GCU is the \nclosed-loop of voltage control as shown in Fig. 7(b), Gu is the \nvoltage controller. In case ∆E=0 and ∆δ=0, the references of ST \noutput voltage amplitude and angle are both fixed, and ST is \noperating as a slack bus (constant voltage and constant \nfrequency). In case ∆\nE≠0 and ∆δ≠0, as shown in Fig. 7(a), the \nST is operating as a constant PQ bus. \n \nFig. 7.  Control block diagram of (a) overall system of GFM, and (b) voltage \nloop. \nIV. IV. ADVANCED SERVICES PROVIDED BY ST  \nA. Power Flow Controllability \n1) Meshed LV networks: In the meshed LV ac grid operation, \nas shown in Fig. 8, the ST (T1) and CPT (T2) can operate either \nin equal power sharing control or in optimal power flow control \n[17]. The sensitivity co efficients for differe nt bus voltages to \nactive and reactive power variation are computed as, \n,\n,\nm\npm\nst\nm\npm\nst\nvk p\nvk q\n \n \n                                   (7) \nwhere m=L1, L2...L10, representing the number of the critical bus \n\n268 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nas shown in Fig. 8.  \nBased on (7), the minimum bus voltage variation control is \nobtained by the active and reactive power flow control in ST. \n\n10 2*\n,,,? 1\nmin\nst st\nmp m s tq m s tpq m\nvk pk qv\n \n  \n\n            (8) \nTo simplify analysis, by assuming that the active power flow \nin the meshed LV ac grid is equally shared between the ST and \nCPT, i.e., pst=pcpt, as shown in Fig. 8(a), the minimum voltage \nvariation optimization in (8) on ly involves the reactive power \nflow control and the simulation results under three different \nscenarios are compared in Fig. 8(b)-(d). \nIn case S2 is open, the high DG penetration leads to the bus \nvoltages at L4 and L5 higher than 1.05pu, as shown in Fig. 8(b) \nand (d), while the high load demand results in the bus voltages \nat L\n7, L8, L9 and L10 lower than 0.95pu, as shown in Fig. 8(b) \nand (c). \n \nFig. 8(a) structure of ST operating in meshed LV ac network, adapted from \nCIGRE LV benchmark mode, and voltage profile at different buses for different \ncontrol schemes under (b) scenario 1: high DG penetration and high load \ndemand, (c) scenario 2: low DG penetr ation and high load demand, and (d) \nscenario 3: high DG penetration and low load demand [17]. \n2) Hybrid MV AC/DC networks : Apart from the LV grids, \nthe ST can also provide signif icant improvements in power \nflow controllability in hybrid MV ac/dc networks, and in both \nMV ac and dc sub-networks. Regarding reactive power flow \ncontrollability in MV ac networks, the ST’s MV inverter \nprovides great flexibility since it can be dispatched with total \ndecoupling from the reactive power demand in ST’s LV ac \nnetwork [6]. Regarding active power flow controllability, the \nintegration of ESS capacity in the ST enables the power \ndispatch of the ST’s MV inve rter, while meeting the power \ndemand in ST’s fed distribution networks [7]. \nHowever, the regulation of ST’s MV dc bus voltage levels \ncan also be exploited to control the active power flow in both \nMV ac and dc sub-networks. In order to exemplify the \npotentialities offered by ST in this subject, the hybrid MVac/dc \nnetwork illustrated in Fig. 9 is considered here. In this example, \nonly the modulation of the dc voltage in ST’s MVdc bus is \nexploited to control the active power flow in the MV dc and ac \nsub-networks. In order to do so, a droop-based controller \ncapable to adjust the dc voltage in ST’s MV dc bus as a function \nof the active power exchanged by the ST’s MVdc bus with the \nMV dc sub-network is incorporated V\ndc ( Pdc) droop, where \ndroop slope and offset can be properly adjusted. \nIn the example illustrated in Fig. 9, the active power levels \nassigned to ST’s LV networks and MV dc distributed resources \noriginate a non-optimal active power flow in both ac and dc \nsub-networks if V\ndc(Pdc) droops are not activated, as shown in \nthe results presented in Fig. 10 - No Droop”. By activating only \nthe slope curve of V\ndc(Pdc) droops (droops’ offset is zero), \nsignificant improvements in active power flow can be obtained, \nas shown in Fig. 10 - “Slope on”. This shows that active power \nflow in hybrid MV ac/dc networks can be improved by locally \nembedded automatic control mechanisms. However, further \nimprovements can be obtained by combining the locally \nembedded automatic control mechanisms. In case of V\ndc(Pdc) \ndroops with additional control actions coming from higher-\nlevel control entities (e.g. System Operator), the regulation of \nthe dc voltage offset parameter available in the V\ndc(Pdc) droop \ncontrollers, as depicted in Fig. 10 - “OffsetOpt”. \nB. Power Quality Improvement and Active Damping \nUnlike a CPT, the ST can not only isolate the harmonics at \nboth the LV and MV ac grids, avoiding propagating from one \nside to another side, due to the existence of the dc-link, but also \nfurther improve the grid quality in terms of harmonics and \nresonance, due to the advanced control of the ST. \n1) MV ac grid current quality improvement: Since the \nMVac/dc stage is always operating as an active front end and \nthe ST is convenient to compensate the distorted current at the \nMV ac grid. Two cases are defined here (MV ac grid current is \ndistorted defined as case 1, and MV grid current is distorted and \nunbalanced defined as case 2) to show the capability of ST to \nimprove the MV ac current quality, as shown in Fig. 11(a). In \ncase 1, with ST, the MVac current THD is reduced from 10.24% \nto 5.22%, and in case 2, the MVac current THD is reduced from \n10.32% to 5.31%. In case2, for the CPT, the asymmetrical \nthree-phase loads in LVac grid results in the unbalanced degree \nof MVac current is about 14.2 9%. In contrast, the ST can \ncontrol the unbalanced degree of  MVac current to almost 0%, \nas shown in Fig. 11(b) [18].  \n2) LV ac grid voltage quality improvement : The high \npenetration of power electronic interfaced sources (DERs, EV \ncharging stations and other loads) results in the harmonic \ninteraction among the power electronics and nonlinear loads, \nsignificantly degrading the LV ac grid voltage quality. Based \non the Thevenin model of ST Fig. 12(a) and the Ohm’ Law, the \nST output voltage is polluted by the distorted load currents in \ncase the output impedance of ST is not zero, as shown in (9). \nApart from the voltage harmonic issue, the dynamic \nperformance of grid voltage during load step change is also \ndegraded. \npcc o g stvv i z                              (9) \nwhere vpcc is the ST output voltage at PCC, vo is the Thevenin  \n\nZHU et al: SMART TRANSFORMER/LARGE FLEXIBLE TRANSFORMER 269 \n \nFig. 9.  Example of a hybrid MV ne twork, with STs providing the interface \nbetween the ac MV network (black) and the dc MV network (blue). \n \n(a)                                                             (b) \nFig. 10.  Active power profiles in STs’ MV dc and ac grid terminals, with \nnominal dc voltage in STs’ MV dc-link (blue), with STs’ MV dc-link voltage \nmodulation using Vdc(Pdc) droop control (red) and with ST’s MV dc-link \nvoltage modulation using Vdc(Pdc) droop control plus Vdc offset control(yellow). \ninternal voltage of ST, zst is the Thevenin output impedance of \nST, ig is the grid current. \nInspired by this law, the output impedance reshaping \napproach was proposed to improve the ST-fed LV ac grid \nvoltage quality [19]. The experimental results of the ST-fed LV \nac grid with diode loads an d with and without DGs are \ncompared in Fig. 13(a). In case of no DGs connection, the grid \nvoltage is polluted by the diode load, and the THD is 10.85%, \nand the voltage THD is increased to 11.65% when the DGs is \nintegrated due to  the  harmonic  interaction  between DGs and \ndiode loads. In contrast, the LV ac grid voltage is improved to \n4.52% with nonlinear loads, and 5.39% with DGs and nonlinear \nloads, respectively, when the power quality control is \nimplemented in ST. \nThe dynamic performance of rapid voltage change during \nload step change is shown in Fig. 13(b). Without the output \nimpedance reshaping approach, the depths of voltage sag and \n \nFig. 11 Comparison of MV ac grid current (a) THD, (b) unbalanced degree[18]. \n \n(a)                                                              (b) \nFig. 12.

Based on the impedance stability criterion, the \nlow pass filter (LPF) and lead element filter (LEF) based active \ndamping approaches were used to damp the resonance by \nreshaping either the ST output impedance amplitude or phase \nor both the output impedance amplitude and phase [10].The \nexperimental results are shown in Fig. 14. When without the \nLPF-based active damping approach, the ST output voltage and \nDG injected current are distorte d seriously as shown in Fig. \n14(a), while the LFT-based active damping approach can \nstabilize the grid voltage and DG injected current, as shown in \nFig. 14(b). Similarly, the performances of the LEF-based active \ndamping approach are compared in Fig. 14(c) and (d). \nC. Frequency Control in Islanding Operation Mode \nThe development of operation strategies for islanding mode \nrequires the existence of ESS. Therefore, ST can play an \nimportant role to develop new control strategies for islanding \noperation, mainly, assuming that it is possible to connect ESS \n\n270 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \n \nFig. 14.  Comparison of the system stability, (a) without and (b) with LPF-based \nactive damping, (c) without and (d) with lead element filter (LEF)-based active \ndamping active damping method [10]. \nin the dc-link. Following this approach, the ST leverages then \nthe development of control strategies for islanding mode in \nMulti-Microgrids (MMG), by coordinating the operation of the \nST power converters with the DERs connected to the grid. A \nMMG corresponds to a MV grid interconnecting several LV \nmicrogrids (MG) where distributed generators can be \nconnected, as described in Fig. 15. At the LV level the MG \nintegrates microgeneration units, local loads and energy storage \nsystems. In the approach presented in [20], it is considered that \nin some secondary substations (SS), the traditional \nelectromagnetic transformer is replaced by ST with a three-\nstage (ac/dc/ac) configuration. At the ST level, the MV and LV \npower converters will operate as a GFM unit or a GFL unit \nbased on the existence of ESS in the dc-link. In this regard, with \nESS connected to the dc-link, MV and LV grids can operate \ndecoupled. Thus, the two grid interfaces correspond to GFM \nunits creating voltage and frequency references for both sides. \nWhen the dc-link does not have ESS, only the LV inverter is \na GFM unit. This arrangement allows that the frequency at the \nLV side is decoupled from the MV grid. However, the MV \ninverter is operated as GFL unit, injecting or absorbing active \npower into/from the MV taking into consideration the load-\ngeneration balance within the MG. In what concerns there \nactive power, there is a decoupling between the two sides of the \nST. \n1) Frequency Coordination Control at the ST level : For the \nsecond case described above (ST without ESS), the LV units \nconnected to the LV grid will not be able to participate in the \nfrequency control due the decoupling caused by the dc-link. \nAiming to induce the participation of the LV DERs in the MV-\nside frequency control, a new droop-based control approach is \nproposed to modulate LV MG frequency as function of the MV \nfrequency. Indeed, as LV ST inverter operates always as GFM, \nit is possible to change the ideal value of the angular frequency \nωo for the LV grid, as described in the following set of \nequations: \n,\n,\n,\n50.2\n50.2 49.8\n49.8\noi fMV MV\noi MVoLV\noi fMV MV\nk f Hz\nf Hz\nkfH z\n\n\n\n \n \n \n            (11) \n \nFig. 15.  MMG concept incorporating the ST. \nBy changing the ideal value of the frequency for the LV grid \nas function of the MV frequency, it is possible to induce the \nparticipation of the DERs located at the LV side in the power-\nfrequency control strategy for the MMG. This modulation of \nthe LV frequency is enabled whenever the MV frequency gets \nout of the dead-band (for example in the range of [49.8 50.2] \nHz). As described previously, as soon as the MV frequency is \nwithin the dead band, the LV  frequency cannot reach the \nnominal frequency as a result of the centralized secondary \nfrequency control. Thus, a local integral controller (secondary \nfrequency control) is included in order to eliminate the \nfrequency deviation in the MG fed by a ST. \n2) Primary and Secondary Frequency Control for Multi-\nMicrogrid Autonomous Operation:  \nIn the envisioned frame work for the autonomous operation \nof the MMG, the ST equipped with ESS will be the key enabler \nfor the islanding operation, since their grid-inverters operate as \nGFM. Furthermore, to support the frequency control, other \nDERs located at the MV and LV grids are also able to \nparticipate in the primary control level. For that purpose, the \ndistributed generation and the distributed energy storage are \nequipped with P-f droop characteristics in order to adapt the \nactive power response according to the frequency deviation. \nThe secondary frequency control is based on the computation \nof new set-points for the DERs connected to the MMG, aiming \nto bring the frequency to the nominal value (50 Hz). The set-\npoints are defined by participation factors considering the \nreserve capacity provided by assets connected to the MV grid \nand by each MG. This control is supported by a communication \ninfrastructure, which allows bidirectional communication \nbetween the control levels of the hierarchical architecture. \n3) Multi-Microgrid Application-Examples: To exemplify the \nfeasibility of the islanding operation for a MMG with ST, it was \nused a 15 kV MV feeder conn ected to the HV grid (60kV) \nthrough a HV/MV transformer. For simulation purpose, it was \nconsidered that in secondary substations 1, 4 and 8 STs have \nbeen installed. SS 1 has ESS operating as a GFM unit for both \nsides LV and MV.  This  MV  feeder  has  also  a  small power  \n\nZHU et al: SMART TRANSFORMER/LARGE FLEXIBLE TRANSFORMER 271 \n \nFig. 16. MMG test system. \nplant with an installed capacity around 1 MW, as described in \nFig. 16. \nFig. 17 presents the simulations results for a scenario in \nwhich the MMG is exporting power to the HV grid prior to the \nislanding transient. When an intentional islanding occurs the \nMV frequency increases and the DERs connected to the MMG \nwith P-f droop characteristics change their active power as \nresponse to the frequency variation. At t=18s, the centralized \nsecondary frequency control is enabled, and from then on, the \nMV inverter is continuously reduced until to be zero. This \nmeans that from the MV side the grid is balanced (generation \nmatches the load) by the definition of the set-points performed \nby the substation controller (SC). The droop characteristic LV \nfrequency/MV frequency allows to transpose the MV \nfrequency variations for the LV side to promote the \nparticipation of the local DERs in the global frequency control, \nas one can see in the moments subsequent to the disconnection \nfrom the upstream grid. \nAlthough the MV frequency is stabilized in 50Hz, the \nsimultaneous actuation of the centralized secondary frequency \ncontrol and droop characteristic LV Angular frequency-MV \n \nFig. 17. MV, MG 4 and MG 8 frequencies during the transition to the islanded \nmode.  \nfrequency lead to the frequency in the MG 4 and MG 8 to be \ndifferent from the nominal value. When the centralized control \nstops its intervention, at the ST level, the local secondary \nfrequency control is activated to conduct the LV frequency to \nthe nominal value (t=22s). \nD. Support to blackstart in active distribution grids \nThe presence of ST within the MMG, provides an \nenvironment where the control strategies described previously \nfor the islanding operation can be adapted and extended to \nlaunch black start (BS) procedures.  \nWhen a blackout at the upstream voltage level or a fault in \nthe HV grid occurs, an automatic transition to the islanding \nmode may not be successful. In this case, the DERs connected \nto the MMG associated with th e ST inverters are coordinated \nto launch a service restoration procedure. The ST will then play \nan important role, especially if equipped with ESS once their \ngrid inverters will operate as GFM units creating references for \nfrequency and voltage within the MMG.  \nBesides, the service restoration procedure will be supported \nby a hierarchical control architecture and communication \ninfrastructure. For this purpose a head controller of the MMG- \nthe SC installed the HV/MV substation-will manage the BS \nprocedures in accordance with a set of rules stored in its \ndatabase. The SC will launch the BS procedure aiming to \nrecover the system for pre-fault conditions (load levels, \ngeneration and distributed storage injection). After checking \nwith Distribution Management System (DMS) that it is \nimpossible to restore the service through the upstream grid, the \nSC will start a BS procedure following a top-down approach, \ncharacterized by sequence of actions: \n1. Disconnect MV/LV transformers, DG units, distributed \nenergy storage (DES) units, microgenerators and loads after the \ngeneral blackout. \n2. Sectionalizing the MMG around each ST with BS \ncapability (equipped with ESS) to verify its capability to launch \na local black start procedure. \n3. Building MV/LV islands following a step-by-step process \nto avoid large inrush currents: The ST with BS capability will \nenergize the MV lines and MV/LV electromagnetic \ntransformers. \n4. Soft start of the STs without storage trough the MV side, \nfor example [21]. \n5. Disabling the local secondary frequency control in the ST \nwithout storage to allow the LV DERs participating in the \npower-frequency control. \n6. Connecting of the DES with a pre-defined initial set-point \n(P=0) for supporting power-frequency control. \n7. Connection of loads and distributed generation through the \ninteraction among the three co ntrol layers: SC, Microgrid \nCentral Controller (MGCC) and local controllers. \n8. Enabling the centralized secondary frequency control \nbased on the computation of participation factors for each MG \nand MV generation unit. \n9. Activating the local secondary frequency control in the \nMG fed by a ST bringing the LV frequency to the nominal \nvalue. \n\n272 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \n \nFig. 18. MV, MG 4 and MG 8 frequencies during BS procedure. \n10. Re-synchronization to the HV grid. \nFor the MV feeder presented in Fig. 17, a BS procedure as \ndescribed previously was simulated. Fig. 18 describes the time \nevolution of the grid frequencies (MV, MG 4 an MG8) inside \nthe MMG during the service restoration procedure. Those time \nevolutions reflect the behaviour of the control systems through \nthe connection of loads and generation units. In this approach, \nneither the fast dynamics associ ated with the inrush currents \nresulting from the magnetization of the electromagnetic \ntransformers nor the phenomena associated with the soft start-\nup of the ST are addressed.  \nAfter the connection of loads and generation is finished, at \nt=85, the SC sends a new set-point to the solar plant to inject \nthe remaining active power (100 kW). From the figure, it is \npossible to observe that the frequencies are not in the nominal \nvalue (50Hz) at t=85s. Then, th e centralised local secondary \nfrequency control is activated and, consequently, MV \nfrequency comes back to the nominal value (50 Hz) while the \nfrequencies keep a deviation in MG 4 and MG 8. Those \nfrequency deviations in MG 4 and MG 8 are afterwards \neliminated. The top-down approach described previously \nassumes that the existing MGs do not have BS capability. \nNevertheless, some secondary substations fed by \nelectromagnetic transformers can be equipped with ESS. ESS \nconnected to the LV busbar can operate as GFM unit for the LV \ngrid. This allows islanding operation when it is not possible to \nkeep the service through the MV level. In those cases, the \nMGCC can manage a parallel BS inside this MG, \nindependently of the conditions in the MV grid. As further \ndevelopment of this top-down approach, one can design a \ncombined BS strategy: a top-down process supported at the MV \nlevel by the ST and a local restoration procedure performed in \nMGs with BS capability. Fo r those purposes, proper \ncoordination strategies should be adopted for ensuring the \nsynchronization of the LV grids to the MV grid. An important \nissue for designing the coordination strategies is to define the \nconditions for the synchronization. Still, the combined strategy \nwill also be supported by the hierarchical control and \ncommunication infrastructure described. \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, the smart transformer architecture and the \nprovided advanced services, which improves the grid \nperformances of the ac, dc and hybrid grid operating in radial \nand meshed networks-fed by sm art transformer. The smart \ntransformer can be controlled in either grid-forming or in grid-\nfollowing mode, in which the smart transformer can be \nequivalent to a slack bus or PQ bus. \nThe ST will play an important role in the future distribution \ngrids by providing significant operation flexibility \nimprovements to the grid. It will enable the interconnection \nbetween AC and DC distribution grids, allowing the \nexploitation of meshed distribution networks where power \nflows can be con-trolled, and a more efficient direct integration \nof distributed DC resources such as PV power plants and \nelectric vehicle DC charging stations. The ST’s power \nconverters can also be exploited to improve power quality in \nthe AC grid sides by mitigating the harmonic distortion \nresulting from non-linear loads an d DG units based on power \nconverters, a phenomena expected to worsen in the coming \nyears. \nApart from these features, the presence of ST serving as \ninterface between MV and LV AC grids will enable other key \nfunctionalities when energy storage capacity is made available \nat ST’s DC link, such as frequency and voltage control in the \nthese grids, islanded operation and black-start supported by the \nST’s electronic power converters. Distribution System \nOperators need to look further to the potential of this new \ndevice as a mean to improve controllability of active \ndistribution grids within the framework of the usage of new \ncontrol and efficient management strategies to be adopted in the \ncoming years. \n \nVI.
