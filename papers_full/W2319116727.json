Introduction\nIn recent years the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region\nhas seen a strong increase in unscheduled compensatory pow-\ner ﬂows, also known as loop ﬂows, between the transmission\nsystems of the respective countries. Cross-border energy t rad-\ning within the CEE region, and the ever-increasing number\nof variable energy sources (mostly wind) in Germany, com-\nbined with the insuﬃcient intra-Germany transmission capa c-\nity, form the main factors that contribute to the escalation of\nthis phenomenon. These unscheduled ﬂows can block a sig-\nniﬁcant part of the physical transmission capacities on the\ninterconnectors in the CEE region, in particular those rela ted\nto the tie-lines of the Polish and Czech power systems due\nto their geographical position. While this limits the amoun t\nof available transmission capacity for market participant s in-\nterested in cross-border energy trading, a much more seriou s\nconsequence is that, due to their nature, unscheduled ﬂows\ncan lead to acutely critical operational situations and for m\na threat to the secure operation of the CEE transmission sys-\ntems [1, 2].\nIntersystem power ﬂows increase the load on individual\nnetwork elements, in particular those lines located in area s\nclose to the borders. Therefore, in order to guarantee the sa fe\noperation of the interconnected power system, it is necessa ry\nto maintain the cross-border ﬂows below certain limit value s.\nCurrently, ensuring the safe operation of the interconnect ed\nsystems requires power ﬂows from the German to the Polish\nsystem to be maintained at a level below 1300 MW in summer\nand 1600 MW in winter.\nIn relation to this situation, the transmission system op-\nerators (TSOs) in the CEE region take appropriate remedial\nmeasures to reduce the negative impact of unscheduled ﬂows.\nThese include re-dispatching power stations (i.e. increas ing\ngeneration in one location balanced by decreasing generati on\nin another), power transmission from Germany to Poland via\nDenmark and Sweden with the use of the Poland-Sweden\nand Denmark-Germany DC connections (known as the “DC\nLoop”), and changing the network topology of the nation-\nal transmission systems [1, 3]. The greatest opportunities , at\nthe risk of incurring additional costs, lie with cross-bord er\nredispatching. For example, increasing generation in the P ol-\nish system by 1000 MW while decreasing generation in the\nGerman system by the same amount reduces the ﬂow of pow-\ner from the German system to the Polish system by about\n500 MW . However, despite the increasingly frequent use of\nthese remedial actions, there are situations in which these\nmeasures are insuﬃcient to maintain the safe operation of\nthe system [1, 3, 4], meaning that successful counteraction of\nthe threats requires the use of other unscheduled power ﬂow\nreduction methods. These include control of the active pow-\ner ﬂows with phase shifting transformers (PST s), which are\nspecial transformers where the voltage phase angle between\ninput and output can be altered to manage the active power\nﬂow along the transmission line. These transformers are als o\nknown as phase shifters.\nTransformers with quadrature voltage regulation and me-\nchanical tap changers, or F ACTS (Flexible AC Transmission\nSystem) devices such as TCP AR (Thyristor Controlled Phase\nAngle Regulator), can be used as phase shifters [5]. Having\nthese devices installed in a transmission network can posi-\ntively inﬂuence the parameters of power system operation in\nthe steady-state, which improves both the system loadabili ty\nand voltage proﬁle, as well as reduce transmission losses an d\nsystem generation dispatch costs [6]. Due to the high speed\nof thyristor control, TCP AR devices can also be helpful in th e\ntransient state, enhancing power system stability by dampi ng\npower swings and frequency oscillations [7–9]. It should be\n∗e-mail: robert.owczarek@polsl.pl\n127\nR. Korab and R. Owczarek\nalso added that phase shifters can inﬂuence the operation of\ndistance protections [10].\nThe Polish and German TSOs are planning to install four\nsets of PST s on the common border, one in each circuit line,\nwith two sets in the Mikulowa (PL) – Hagenverder (DE)\ndouble-circuit line and another other two sets in the Kra-\njnik (PL) – Vierraden (DE) double-circuit line, once the lat -\nter is switched to 400 kV (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the Czech\nTSO is planning to install two PST s in the Hradec substation,\non the border with the German TSO in the Hradec (CZ) –\nRohrsdorf (DE) double-circuit line [11].\nFig. 1. Main tie-lines in the CEE region – current status\nThe main purpose of this study was to determine the im-\npact of the installation of these PST s on cross-border power\nﬂows in the CEE region, including the potential capability\nto reduce unscheduled ﬂows. Additionally, based on these re -\nsults, the basic parameters were proposed for the PST s locat ed\non the border between Poland and Germany.\n2. Power ﬂow control using PSTs\nThe active power ﬂow through the transmission line is given\nby the following equation [7]:\nP1 = V1 ·V2\nXL\n·sin δ, (1)\nwhere V1 and V2 are the voltage modules at the sending and\nreceiving ends of the line, respectively, δ is the power angle\n(the phase angle diﬀerence between V 1 and V 2), and XL is\nthe line reactance.\nEquation (1) shows that the active power ﬂow through the\nline can be controlled by changing voltage levels V1 and V2,\nreactance XL and power angle δ . However, the full extent\nof active power ﬂow in the line can be changed by adjusting\npower angle δ . By controlling angle δ , not only the value of\nthe power ﬂow but also the direction of ﬂow can be changed\n[12]. In practice this can be done by using PST s.\nA PST connected in series in a transmission line (Fig. 2a)\nintroduces to voltage V\n1 at the beginning of the line a booster\nvoltage ∆ V , perpendicular to it. As a result, the resultant volt-\nage V 3 behind the PST is shifted in phase by angle α , whereas\nthe power angle of the line is equal to (δ + α ) (Fig. 2b). In\nthis case, the formula describing the active power ﬂow takes\nthe following form [13]:\nP2 = V3 ·V2\nXL + XP ST\n·sin (δ + α ), (2)\nwhere XP ST is the PST reactance, α is the PST angle (the\nphase angle diﬀerence between the PST terminal voltages).\na)\nb)\nFig. 2. Controlling the active power ﬂow using a PST : a) circu it\ndiagram, b) phasor diagram for a line with a PST\nA change in the booster voltage ∆ V causes a change in the\nangle α and therefore also a change in the line ﬂow P2. The\nvoltage ∆ V can be controlled within a range from negative\nvalues to positive values, resulting in an increase or decre ase\nin the power angle, respectively, and thus the power P2.\nPST s are usually used for management of cross-border\npower ﬂows in interconnected power systems or for power\nﬂow control in parallel transmission corridors [7]. These d e-\nvices have either been implemented or at least seriously con -\nsidered by several countries [14–20].\n3. Subject and method of research\nStudies were performed using PLANS distribution software.\nThe analysis included power ﬂow calculations based on mod-\nels of the interconnected power system in CEE, developed for\nthe year 2014, involving the Polish 400/220/110 kV networks\nand the transmission networks of the neighbouring countrie s,\n128 Bull. Pol. Ac.: T ech. 64(1) 2016\nImpact of phase shifting transformers on cross-border powe r ﬂows in the Central and Eastern Europe region\nfor two characteristic load states, i.e. summer peak demand\n(SPD) and winter peak demand (WPD). PST was modelled by\nan ideal transformer (leakage impedance equal to zero) with\na complex turns ratio [21].\nThe installation of PST s was considered in all circuits\nof the 400 kV tie-lines: Hrade-Rohrsdorf (HRD-ROE) on\nthe Czech-German border as well as Mikulowa-Hagenverder\n(MIK-HAG) and Krajnik- Vierraden (KRA- VIE) on the Polish-\nGerman border. At present, the Krajnik- Vierraden tie-line op-\nerates at 220 kV (line built to 400 kV parameters); however,\nit will be modiﬁed to utilise 400 kV , the value assumed in the\nmodel.\nThe power ﬂow calculations were divided into three steps.\nThe ﬁrst step included the control of the PST s installed on th e\nborder between Poland and Germany. The second included the\nborder between the Czech Republic and Germany. The third\nand last step was carried out for both proﬁles simultaneous-\nly. Control of PST s was performed both in parallel (i.e. the\nphase angle of all PST s was changed simultaneously by the\nsame value and in the same direction) and opposition (i.e.\nthe phase angle of PST s on both cross-border proﬁles was\nchanged simultaneously by the same value, but in opposite\ndirections), over the phase angle range of ±45◦, in 5 ◦ steps.\nThe total angle range assumed for the analysis resulted from\ncomputing capabilities, because beyond 45 ◦ the power ﬂow\ngenerally did not converge. However, it should be noted that\nthe PST s currently used in European transmission grids do\nnot exceed an angle adjustment range of ±40◦.\n4. Results and analysis\nThe results are divided into the following subsections. In t he\nﬁgures for the Polish and Czech interconnectors, the posi-\ntive values indicate an active power that ﬂows in while the\nnegative values indicate an active power that ﬂows out res-\npectively from the Polish and Czech power systems.\n4.1. PSTs on the Polish-German border . Figure 3 shows\nthe eﬀect of the joint operation of four PST s installed on\nthe Polish-German border. It can be seen that the character-\nistic of the power ﬂow through the cross-border line with\nrespect to the PST angle is quasi-linear. The results reveal ed\nthat the reduction of active power ﬂowing from the German\nsystem into the Polish system occurred at the negative val-\nues of the PST angle. Depending on the operating status of\nthe interconnected system, controllable power ﬂows in the\nPoland-Germany proﬁle are contained within the range 27\nto 29 MW/1 ◦. There were observed larger changes in pow-\ner ﬂows for the Mikulowa-Hagenverder line (15–17 MW/1 ◦)\nthan for the Krajnik- Vierraden line (about 12 MW/1 ◦). This\nis due to a greater power grid density near the Mikulowa\nsubstation (smaller equivalent reactance) in relation to t he\ndensity of the power grid in the northern area of Poland. It\nwas found that the control of power ﬂows through the cross-\nborder interconnections in the Poland-Germany proﬁle also\nhad an impact on the power ﬂow through the interconnec-\ntions to other cross-border proﬁles of the analysed CEE grid\n(Fig. 4). The largest changes were observed on the Polish-\nCzech border (about 21 MW/1 ◦) and the Czech-German pro-\nﬁle (about 19 MW/1 ◦). The Polish system interchange bal-\nance was virtually constant (small changes in the balance we re\ndue to changes in power losses in the 400/220/110 kV power\ngrid).\na)\nb)\nFig. 3. Impact of parallel control using PST s installed in th e\nMikulowa-Hagenverder and Krajnik - Vierraden tie-lines on active\npower ﬂows\nFig. 4. Impact of parallel control using PST s installed in th e\nMikulowa-Hagenverder and Krajnik - Vierraden tie-lines on active\npower ﬂows through the individual cross-border proﬁles in t he sum-\nmer season\nBull. Pol. Ac.: T ech. 64(1) 2016 129\nR. Korab and R. Owczarek\nIn the analysed operating conditions of the interconnect-\ned system, a number of overloads were observed at zero PST\nangle, mainly in the 110 kV network. In general, more over-\nloads were observed in the model that mapped the summer\npeak than for the winter (17 vs. 5 overloads in the 110 kV net-\nwork). The reason for this is mainly the lower current-carry ing\ncapacity of overhead lines in summer conditions. In the mod-\nel for the summer season, the use of the PST s to control the\nﬂow of active power inﬂuences both the increase in the num-\nber of overloads in the 110 kV network and the occurrence of\noverloading of some lines in the EHV grid (Fig. 5), mainly\nin the areas located close to the border (conditioned by an in -\ncrease in power ﬂowing through the cross-border interchang e\nlines). For the Polish system, these involved the areas near\nthe Mikulowa and Krajnik substations, and were particularl y\nevident for angles in the 35–45 ◦ range. A transformer in the\n400/220 kV Hradec substation, for which current overloads\nalready occur at an angle of −20◦, was a critical element in\nthe analysed CEE area network. This means that obtaining\nthe required control of the PST s on the Poland-Germany pro-\nﬁle will require appropriate modernisation of the componen ts\nbeing at risk of overload.\nFig. 5. Impact of parallel control using PST s installed in th e\nMikulowa-Hagenverder and Krajnik - Vierraden tie-lines on the num-\nber of overloads of network elements in the summer peak deman d\nThe ﬁndings also showed that a reduction in active power\nﬂowing from the German system into the Polish system can\nreduce the transmission losses generated in the meshed Pol-\nish power system network. For the winter season, a reduction\nof losses in the 0 ◦ to −45◦ angle range (maximum at −25◦,\namounting to 2.8%) was achieved (Fig. 6a), while for the\nsummer season, in the 0 ◦ to −15◦ angle range (maximum at\n−10◦, amounting to 0.4%) (Fig. 6b). Nevertheless, reduction\nthe power ﬂow on the Poland-Germany border contributed to\nthe growth of active power losses in neighbouring systems,\nand the entire analysed network of the CEE region.\nThe results of the power ﬂow analysis allowed the de-\ntermination of the ﬁrst PST parameter, which is the desired\nangle variation range α . In the existing circumstances, with a\nlarge equivalent reactance, to obtain a signiﬁcant reducti on in\nactive power ﬂowing from the German system into the Polish\nsystem, the use of PST s with a suitably wide range of angle\nadjustment α of about ±40◦ is required.\nDue to the interworking of the PST s with the cross-border\nlines, the rated (throughput) power of the PST s needs to be\ncorrelated with the load-carrying capacity of the line. Cur -\nrently, the Polish power system has two interconnections wi th\nthe German system, and both are designed as double-circuit\noverhead lines. The load-carrying capacity of one circuit o f\nthe Mikulowa-Hagenverder line for low ambient temperature s\nis 1386 MV A, while that of the Krajnik- Vierraden line circui t\nis less because it currently operates at 220 kV . The latter wi ll\nbe upgraded to 400 kV , which will result in an increase in its\nload-carrying capacity to at least the same level as that for\nthe Mikulowa-Hagenverder line. Because of the line capacit y\nand the ability to control PST s in the Poland-Germany proﬁle ,\nPST s with throughput power levels of at least 750–1000 MV A\nare recommended [12].\na)\nb)\nFig. 6.

Summary\nThe main goal of this study was to determine the impact of\nthe installation of PST s on the Polish-German and Czech-\nGerman borders on cross-border power ﬂows, including the\npotential capability to reduce unscheduled ﬂows. The resul ts\nof the analysis show that the control of active power ﬂows in\nthe Poland-Germany proﬁle, using the PST s installed in each\ncircuit of the Mikulowa-Hagenverder and Krajni- Vierraden\nlines, gives a signiﬁcant reduction in active power ﬂowing\ninto Poland from the German system and thus leads to a re-\nduction of unscheduled ﬂows between the power systems of\nGermany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria.\nHowever, in order to obtain such eﬀects, PST s with a suﬃ-\nciently broad range of phase angle control, of about ±40◦,\nare required. Such PST s should also have a rated (throughput )\npower of at least 750–1000 MV A.\nInstallation of PST s on the Poland-Germany interconnec-\ntions, with a control range of ±40◦, should enable a reduc-\ntion in unwanted power ﬂows to Poland of approx. 1100 MW .\nObtaining the same eﬀect in the absence of PST s, i.e. when\ncontrolling the power ﬂows through cross-border redispatc h-\ning, would require an increase in generation within the Poli sh\nsystem of approx. 2200 MW , while reducing generation in the\nGerman system by the same value. This may not be feasible\ndue to a lack of suﬃcient power reserves in the Polish sys-\ntem or possible congestions. Therefore, from the perspecti ve\nof operating safety for the systems combined in the CEE, in-\ncluding the Polish system, the installation of PST s is justi ﬁed.\nThe indicated control capabilities of the PST s installed\non the Poland-Germany interconnections are possible to\nbe achieved, assuming that the control is carried out on-\nly on the cross-border proﬁle. The analysis performed for\nthe planned PST s on the Poland-Germany and the Czech\nRepublic-Germany proﬁles revealed that the resultant cont rol\ncapabilities of these devices might be subject to “strength en-\ning” or “weakening”. This means that, in order to maximise\nthe controllability, guarantee the secure operation of the in-\nterconnected systems as well as ensure adequate possibilit ies\nfor cross-border energy trade, development of a method for\ncoordinated control of PST s in the CEE region and appro-\npriate interconnection arrangements are required. The PST\ncontrol method can be based on metaheuristic optimization\nalgorithms [22], such as particle swarm optimization (PSO)\n[23–25]. It should be noted that the operation of PST s aﬀects\nthe operation of neighbouring systems; therefore, their us e\nneeds to be preceded by international arrangements.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Bidding Zones Deﬁnition , http://www.pse.pl/uploads/pliki/\n17225Position\nof CEPS MA VIR PSEO SEPS-Bidding Zo-\nnes Deﬁnition.pdf (March 2012).\n[2] Unplanned Flows in the CEE region , http://www.pse.pl/\nuploads/pliki/Unplanned ﬂows in the CEE region.pdf (Janu-\nary 2013).\n[3] H.
