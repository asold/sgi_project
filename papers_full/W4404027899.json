    "abstract": "Abstract Background The COVID‐19 pandemic accelerated the shift to remote learning, heightening scrutiny of open‐book examinations (OBEs) versus closed‐book examinations (CBEs) within science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEM) education. This study evaluates the efficacy of OBEs compared to CBEs on student performance and perceptions within STEM subjects, considering the emerging influence of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT‐3. Methods Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review analysed peer‐reviewed articles published from 2013, focusing on the impact of OBEs and CBEs on university STEM students. Standardised mean differences were assessed using a random effects model, with heterogeneity evaluated by I 2 statistics, Cochrane's Q test and Tau statistics. Results Analysis of eight studies revealed mixed outcomes. Meta‐analysis showed that OBEs generally resulted in better scores than CBEs, despite significant heterogeneity ( I 2 = 97%). Observational studies displayed more pronounced effects, with noted concerns over technical difficulties and instances of cheating. Discussion Results suggest that OBEs assess competencies more aligned with current educational paradigms than CBEs. However, the emergence of LLMs poses new challenges to OBE validity by simplifying the generation of comprehensive answers, impacting academic integrity and examination fairness. Conclusions While OBEs are better suited to contemporary educational needs, the influence of LLMs on their effectiveness necessitates further study. Institutions should prudently consider the competencies assessed by OBEs, particularly in light of evolving technological landscapes. Future research should explore the integrity of OBEs in the presence of LLMs to ensure fair and effective student evaluations.",
