One prominent approach is symbolic\nnarrative planning [6, 9, 15, 19, 21], where a narrative goal is set as\nthe plot’s end, and character action sequences leading to this goal\n- known as “narrative plans” [6] - are generated. Generating such\nplans requires a hand-crafted knowledge base using formal logical\narXiv:2405.13042v2  [cs.HC]  2 Nov 2024\nYi Wang, Qian Zhou, and David Ledo\nlanguage that defines preconditions and effects of a predefined ac-\ntion set within a story [12]. Given the extensive engineering work\nrequired to construct this knowledge base, the generated plots offer\nlimited complexity and scale.\nOne way to address this challenge is to use Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to drive character behaviors [ 3, 11, 18]. Through\nLLMs, plots naturally emerge from the interactions between vir-\ntual characters and their environments. For example, Generative\nAgents [11] simulate believable human behaviors extending LLMs\nto store a comprehensive log of the agents’ experiences, combine\ntheir memories to form higher-level thoughts, and retrieve them as\nneeded for behavior planning. This demonstrates LLM’s capabilities\nof acting as proxies for human behaviors and conversations [ 1],\neliminating the need to craft the knowledge base.\nPlot generation via fully autonomous characters controlled by\nLLMs produces emergent narratives [2]. However, this type of plot\ngeneration “struggles with ‘herding cats’ when the narrative is re-\nquired to contain certain content” [20]. It is unclear how a story\nwriter might control and direct the plot progression, especially\nconsidering how it depends on the collective behavior of multiple\ncharacters involved. This is even more challenging for LLM-based\nemergent narratives due to their black-box nature. In a more tradi-\ntional symbolic narrative planning approach, writers are able to set\nconstraints on the generated behaviors, and the planning systems\ncentralize decision making to ensure they meet the author’s con-\nstraints [20]. It is unclear what kind of authorial structure could\nbe compatible with emergent narrative from LLM-based character\nsimulation, which is generated in a decentralized manner.\nIn this work, we presentStoryVerse, a system that uses LLM-based\nnarrative planning and character simulation to generate dynamic\nstories through a novel authorial structure called “abstract acts”.\nStoryVerse introduces a plot creation workflow that mediates be-\ntween a writer’s authorial intent and the emergent behaviors from\nLLM-driven character simulation, given a game environment. In-\nstead of directly specifying characters’ actions to interfere with\nthe character simulation, the writer defines high-level plot outlines\nas abstract acts, which are later “instantiated” into concrete acts\nthrough an Act Director component. When instantiating an abstract\nact, the Act Director takes into account the state of the game world,\nthe previous acts, and character actions resulting from an ongoing\nLLM-driven Character Simulator component. The resulting con-\ncrete act contains a sequence of character actions, which can be\nexecuted in the game environment to update the world state, thus\ninforming subsequent character simulation and the following acts.\nThis allows writers to create “living stories” that dynamically adapt\nto various game world states, influenced by the writer’s autho-\nrial intents, character simulation results, and players’ actions. To\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the proposed workflow, we created\na proof-of-concept prototype integrating an LLM-based character\nsimulator similar to AgentVerse [3], and a novel LLM-based nar-\nrative planner, tightly coupled by the game environment and the\nstate of the game world. We showcase StoryVerse with examples in\ndifferent stories. Specifically, our contributions are:\n• A plot creation workflow that mediates between the cre-\native input from the story writer and the emergent behav-\niors exhibited by simulated characters.\n• An authorial structure called “abstract acts” that enables co-\ncreating dynamic plot between a writer and an LLM-based\ncharacter simulation.\n• An LLM-based narrative planning process that iteratively\ngenerates and reviews character action sequences using\nLLM and a simulated game environment.\n• StoryVerse: a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates\nthe feasibility and applications of the proposed workflow.\n2 METHOD: DYNAMIC PLOT CREATION\nUSING LLM-BASED NARRATIVE PLANNING\nAND CHARACTER SIMULATIONS\nOur work is built on top of the character simulation in game envi-\nronments where the characters’ behaviors are driven by LLMs [11].\nThe goal is to provide a novel plot creation workflow that allows\na story writer to direct the progression of the plot while leaving\nroom for the details to emerge from the character simulation as\nwell as the interaction between the player and characters. In this\nsection, we describe our workflow centered around the concept of\n“abstract act” and LLM-based narrative planning.\n2.1 Plot Creation Workflow\nOur goal is to allow writers to author abstract yet high-level plot out-\nlines that can be automatically “instantiated” into specific character\nactions at play-time, with the instantiation taking into account the\nstate of the game world. The system integrates three major compo-\nnents (Figure 1): an Act Director, a Character Simulator , and a Game\nEnvironment. The Act Director processes the writer’s input and\nuses an LLM-based narrative planner to generate character action\nsequences. The LLM-based Character Simulator produces character\nactions that drive the characters by default when no eligible input\nis found from the writer. The Game Environment contains a set of\ncharacters, locations, and action schemas that specify character ac-\ntions that are executable through the game system. Consistent with\nsymbolic narrative planning [12], we refer to these elements as the\nStory Domain . Figure 2 (left) shows two examples of story domains.\nThe game environment also maintains the World State, which con-\nsists of a collection of variables that hold relevant values for the\ngame mechanics, such as the characters’: location, attributes (e.g.,\nstrength and health points), relationship scores, as well as their\nmemories from the simulation. To enable writers to co-develop\ncharacter actions with the LLM-driven character simulation, we\nintroduce abstract acts, a novel authorial structure compatible with\ncharacter simulation. The writer can define a high-level plot outline\nthrough a set of abstract acts.\nAt each timestep during play-time, the system evaluates whether\nthere are any pending abstract acts that have met their prerequisites.\nIf there are, the Act Director will process these acts and generate\ncharacter actions. Otherwise, the Character Simulator will execute\nto generate character actions. After the character actions are gen-\nerated, either from Act Director or Character Simulator , the Game\nEnvironment executes the actions and updates the world states. The\nGame Environment ensures that the world states reflect the changes\nresulting from the generated character actions. Once the game en-\nvironment executes the actions, the game player can interfere with\nthe game by changing the world states, such as by saving or killing\nStoryVerse: Towards Co-authoring Dynamic Plot with LLM-based Character Simulation via Narrative Planning\nFigure 2: Two example story domains - The Ville (top) and Ant & Dove (bottom) - together with instantiated versions of the\nfour abstract acts from Figure 1. Note that the text for narrations, dialogs, and monologues is all generated by LLMs.\na character. Finally, the game environment sends the updated world\nstates back to Act Director for the next timestep.\nThis process creates a living story with its progression influ-\nenced by the story writer, the character simulator, and the actions\nof the players within the game environment. While the writer de-\nfines abstract acts, which describe high-level dramatic conflicts\nand turning points, this authorial structure leaves space for the\ndetails to emerge from both the character simulation and how the\nplayer interacts with the characters. As a result, the stories have\nthe flexibility to evolve and respond to these dynamic factors.\n2.2 Abstract Acts\nIn traditional screenplay writing, writers use the concept of an“act“\nto structure a sequence of movements that turns on a major reversal\nin the value-charged condition of a character’s life [8]. Inspired by\nthis notion, we use the term abstract act to structure a sequence\nof character actions leading toward a (possibly abstract) narrative\ngoal. The term“abstract” highlights the separation of the story from\nthe specific details of the underlying world states. This allows for\nthe final story to be a collaborative creation involving the author,\nthe player, and the emergent behaviors from the LLM character\nsimulation. By abstracting the story from the specifics of the world\nstates, it becomes more adaptable and open to contributions from\nmultiple sources, enabling a dynamic storytelling experience.\nAn abstract act is defined by the following elements:\n• A high-level narrative goal representing a dramatic conflict\nor a turning point in the story (e.g., “a character gets into a\nlife-threatening accident” ).\nYi Wang, Qian Zhou, and David Ledo\n• A set of prerequisites connected by logical conjunction\nand/or disjunction. Each prerequisite can be:\n(1) A statement about the current world state that can\nbe evaluated (as true or false) by the LLM or game\nenvironment (e.g., ‘‘John is loved by all characters” or\n“there are at least 5 characters alive” ),\n(2) A statement about the player’s action, (e.g.,“The player\nexecutes eat(X) action with X being a poisonous food\nitem”),\n(3) The fulfilment or failure of another abstract act, used\nto specify dependencies between abstract acts.\n• A set of placeholders – a construct representing an answer\nto be fulfilled at a future time (similar to \"Promises\" in com-\nputer programming). Placeholders refer to specific content\nin the “instantiation” of current act, to carry over to sub-\nsequent acts. Each placeholder is a pair of code-name and\nnatural language description (e.g., “X - the character who\ngot into the life-threatening accident” ).\nThe narrative goal and prerequisites may include placeholders\nfor story specifics that will be determined by the instantiation of\na previous act. For example, “a character saves X’s life” , with “X”\nbeing a placeholder for the character who“got into a life-threatening\naccident” in a previous act (which is unknown at the time of au-\nthoring). 1 Incorporating placeholders into the narrative goal and\nprerequisites allows the story to adapt and respond to the choices\nand actions made by players as well as the interventions from char-\nacter simulation. In addition, it enforces coherence of plot elements\nacross abstract acts and allows the author to define continuations\nbetween acts without knowing the specifics of each act in advance.\nWhen multiple abstract acts are added by the writer, they are\nnot executed sequentially. Each act has its own prerequisites as\ndefined by the writer. This approach allows the writer to create\nbranching stories, where the path to take is determined by both the\nplayer’s actions, as well as the character simulation. Additionally,\nabstract acts can be grouped by the writer, indicating that they form\na complete storyline. This means that the entire story reaches com-\npletion only when all the abstract acts within the group have been\nexecuted. Grouping abstract acts allows for a structured narrative\nauthoring experience.\nExample 2.1. We use a story about “Kindness is never wasted”\nto showcase the usage of abstract acts extracted from the Ant &\nDove story from Aesop Fable following prior work on narrative\nplanning [4, 16]. As shown in Figure 1, the writer creates the four\nabstract acts with high-level narrative goals such as life-threatening\nand life-saving events to depict the turning points as well as the\nrelationship between characters. Note that the execution order does\nnot depend on the creation order. The placeholders for characters\nindicate the chronological relationship between acts and enforce\nconsistency among them.\n2.3 Act Director\nUsing the writer-specified abstract acts, the Act Director enables\na narrative planning approach using LLMs to generate a concrete\nsequence of character actions that can achieve the narrative goals\n1Note that the occurrence of a placeholder in a prerequisite implies the completion of\nan act with the placeholder as an output as another prerequisite.\nspecified in the abstract acts. The sequence of character actions is\ncalled a (narrative) plan .\nAt each timestep of play-time, the Act Selector evaluates whether\nthere are any pending abstract acts that have met their prerequisites\nand selects a qualified act to execute. Once selected, the abstract act\nundergoes a pre-processing step, where the placeholders for specific\nplot content contained in the narrative goal are replaced with the\nactual referred content established and saved in the execution of\nthe previous abstract acts (if any). For example, a narrative goal “Y\nsaved X from the accident” might become “The dove saved the ant\nfrom the accident” .\nFollowing [17], we design an LLM-based iterative narrative plan-\nning process involving plan generation and plan revision for better\nquality of the narrative plans (Figure 3). The plan generator takes a\nnarrative goal, the world state, and the story domain as the input\nand is prompted to generate a plan. Once generated, the plan re-\nviewer provides feedback regarding the quality and feasibility of\nthe action sequence to improve it. The feedback has three parts:\n• Overall Coherency Evaluation Feedback is obtained by\nprompting an LLM to comment on the overall coherency of\nthe generated plot and make suggestions for improvement.\n• Game Environment Evaluation Similar to [17], feed-\nback comes from executing the generated action sequence\nin a simulated game environment, and reporting observa-\ntions on the success/failure of the execution.\n• Character Simulation Evaluation For every action in\nthe sequence, we prompt an LLM to play the role of the sub-\nject of the action. Given the current world state including\nthe character’s memory, we ask the LLM if the motivation\nfor the character to perform the action has been established.\nWe include the explanation to this question in the feedback,\nif the motivation has not been established. 2\nThe plan generator is then prompted to revise the previous ac-\ntion sequence according to the feedback received. The process is\nrepeated for a user-specified number of times, or until the generated\nplan is executable.\nOnce the final sequence of character actions is generated, it\nwill be executed by the game environment to update the world\nstate. Meanwhile, it will also be sent to the Placeholder Resolution\ncomponent (Figure 1), which prompts an LLM to identify specific\ncontent referred to by each placeholder from the current act, and\nstore the placeholder-content mapping for future act execution. For\nexample, if placeholder 𝑋 is defined to refer to “the character who\ngot into an accident”, then Placeholder Resolution will ask an LLM,\n“what is the character who got into an accident”, and then store the\nanswer with placeholder 𝑋 .\nExample 2.2. The generated narrative plans are in the form of a\nlist of tuples containing an action following the action schema in\nthe story domain, the subject of the action, and the thought behind\nthe action, for example:\n{\n\"subject\": \"dove\",\n\"action\": \"moveTo(oak_tree)\",\n2In addition, we also ask an LLM if the narrative goal is already met at the current\naction. If the answer is yes, the generated plan will be truncated to have the current\naction as the last action.\nStoryVerse: Towards Co-authoring Dynamic Plot with LLM-based Character Simulation via Narrative Planning\nFigure 3: LLM-based narrative planning that iteratively gen-\nerates and reviews the plan.\n\"thought\": \"I sense danger!\nI must fly away quickly to avoid the hunter.\"\n}\nFigure 3 shows an iteration of plan revision for Act 3 as described\nin Figure 1. The plan was generated using the Ant & Dove story\ndomain from Figure 2.\n2.4 Implementation\nFor demonstration purposes, we implemented a basic LLM-based\ncharacter simulation component similar to a minimal version of\nAgentVerse [3]. Each character is associated with a pre-authored\ntextual description, and a structured memory storage updated upon\nexecution of actions. At each timestep, each character takes an\naction generated by an LLM. The component can be replaced with\na more sophisticated implementation such as [3, 11, 18]. We also\nimplemented a proxy for game environment which simply main-\ntains a list of variables defining a world state, and updates the vari-\nables upon execution of character actions. We use prompt chaining\ntechniques to achieve complex tasks by dynamically assembling\nmultiple prompts. Hand-crafted few-shot examples are used in the\nprompts to increase the quality of outputs. We used gpt-4-0125-\npreview as the LLM for all the experiments reported in the next sec-\ntion. The maximum number of narrative plan revisions (𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 )\nwas 2.\n3 EXAMPLES\nWe describe two examples to demonstrate plot creation workflow\nusing two story domains: The Ant & Dove and The Ville, which have\nbeen previously used in narrative planning [4, 16] and generative\nagents [11] research. Figure 2 lists the characters, locations, and\naction schema for these story domains. Both examples are driven\nby a set of abstract acts based on the theme of \"Kindness is never\nwasted\" (Figure 1). Before any acts are executed, an initial round of\ncharacter simulation sets the stage for the story by simulating the\ndaily lives of the characters (Figure 2 character simulation). The Act\nFigure 4: A variation of Ant & Dove story on “A kindness is\nnever wasted” instantiated with the ant dead.\nDirector then takes the four abstract acts as input and generates\nthe action sequence for each act in both story domains.\nExample 3.1. In Ant & Dove (Figure 2, bottom), the ant (character\nX) slips into the water in Act 1 while searching for food, which\ncontinues its behavior from the character simulation. The dove\n(character Y) rescues the ant in Act 2. Although the hunter character\nis not explicitly mentioned in the abstract acts, the narrative planner\nincludes this character as part of the second accident that endangers\nthe dove in Act 3. Finally, the ant saves the dove from the hunter\nin Act 4, completing the recreation of the original Ant & Dove fable.\nAfter the four acts conclude, the characters return to their daily\nroutines through the character simulation. The actions performed\nby the characters in the post-character simulation reflect the events\nthat took place during the four acts.\nAdditionally, to demonstrate how the story adapts to different\nworld states, we manually change the status of the ant to be dead.\nAs the ant is dead, the Act Director adapts the story to the available\ncharacters shown in Figure 4.\nExample 3.2. We demonstrate the transferability of abstract acts\nacross story domains using the same set of abstract acts in The\nVille. The story (Figure 2, top) includes three characters: Isabella\n(cafe owner), Eddy (music student), and Abigail (digital artist). Eddy\nplays character X, who injures his ankle in an accident (Act 1).\nAbigail plays character Y, who saves Eddy and offers help (Act 2).\nAbigail later experiences demotivation after accidentally ruining\nher creations (Act 3), but Eddy’s music inspires her to regain moti-\nvation and work on her sketches again (Act 4). Note that Isabella,\nalthough introduced as a character, is not selected to participate in\nthe acts due to her busy schedule with the Valentine’s Day party at\nthe cafe, which prevents her from leaving and interfering with the\nstory unfolding in an outdoor park.\nIn our examples, the four acts happen to be executed sequentially\nwith no character simulation in between. In other cases, acts can\nbe executed interlacing with character simulation, likely due to the\nprerequisites not immediately satisfied after the previous act, such\nas waiting for a few timesteps of character simulation.\nYi Wang, Qian Zhou, and David Ledo\n4 DISCUSSION\nWe present our StoryVerse system as a proof-of-concept to a plot\ncreation workflow that mediates between a writers’ authored con-\ntent and the emergent behaviors from character simulation. For\npractical use of this approach in games, further technical aspects\nneed to be considered. Like other work utilizing LLMs for story\ngeneration, the quality of the generated plots is limited by the\nLLMs’ known challenge of preserving long-term dependency and\ncoherence [10]. It is worth investigating how to incorporate exist-\ning solutions such as increasing the size of LLM’s context window\n[5], utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation [7] and adopting a\nhierarchical generation approach [10] to mitigate this issue. The\nfrequent call to LLMs also raises concerns about delays in the act\nexecution process during gameplay.\nRiedl and Bulitko [13] have proposed a taxonomy of interactive\nnarrative systems in terms of three dimensions - authorial intent,\ncharacter autonomy, and player modeling. Within this design space,\nStoryVerse situates at hybrid authorial intent with a relatively strong\nlevel of virtual character autonomy, which has been identified as a\ngap in [13]. The Act Director serves as an autonomous surrogate\nfor the writer, which has a similar role as the experience manager\nin [14]. However, an LLM-based approach enables a more flexible\nand generalizable representation of author’s constraints on the plot\nsearch space (such as the “island” concept from [14]), and reduces\nthe required knowledge engineering expertise for specifying autho-\nrial intents compared to symbolic planning based approaches. The\nwork can be further extended in the player modeling dimension.\nOur proof-of-concept system simulates the player intervention via\nupdating the world states caused by player actions. Potential Im-\nprovement in player modeling could result from incorporating a\npersona derived from the player’s preference and the protagonist’s\ncharacter role. For example, when instantiating abstract acts into\nconcrete plots, involving characters preferred by the player/protag-\nonist would likely enhance the immersive experience.\n5 CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we proposed a novel plot creation workflow intended\nto balance authorial intent and emergent behaviors for a game\nworld with LLM-driven virtual characters. The workflow allows\nstories to be co-created by the author, the character simulation\nand the player’s actions asynchronously. We present our prototype\nsystem StoryVerse as a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibil-\nity of proposed workflow with examples showcasing the system’s\npotential. Our next steps include systematic evaluations in terms\nof standard quantitative metrics for story generation, as well as\nuser studies, for us to understand the performance of the techni-\ncal approach, and the feasibility and potential of the workflow in\na real-world setting. We see StoryVerse as an early step towards\nnovel interactive narrative design workflows that leverage LLMs to\nenable immersive narrative experiences tightly coupled with story\nand game mechanics.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Inworld AI. 2023.
