    "abstract": "Natural-language question-answering is a promi sing interface for retri eving in-fOlmation in mobile contex ts because it by-passes the problem of presenting documents and interim searc h resu lts on a small screen.This paper considers language-models suitable for rapid predictive text-input and spoken input or natural-language questions.It describes a varied corpus of fact-seek ing questions posed by users online and analyzes its structure.Wc find it to bc highly constmined lexically despite its wide spectrum of topics, with a per-word perplexity less than 47 with around 2.6% of words in the test set out-of-vocabulary.One implication is that predictive interfaces can greatly speed up the input of natural-language ques ti ons wit h a keypad or stylus.Another is that au tomatic speech-recognition of such questions can be quite accurate.",
