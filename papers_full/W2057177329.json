  "abstract": "Transfer function (TF) is an acknowledged method for power transformer mechanical faults detection. However the past published works mostly discovered how to specify the faults levels and paid less attention to detection of the type of faults using comparison of TFs. whereas, it seems important for most of the applications to specify the type of fault without opening the unit. This paper presents a new method based on vector fitting (VF) to compare the TFs and specify the type, level and location of the fault. For development of the method, and its verification the required measurements are carried out on four model transformers; under intact condition, and under different fault conditions (axial displacement, radial deformation, disc space variation and short circuit of winding) and the TFs are determined. Employing VF, the coefficients of TFs are determined with the required accuracy. Using those coefficients, a new index is introduced to specify the type, level and location of the fault in the winding. Convincingly good results were obtained. Therefore it is believed that this finding could be helpful in fault diagnosis in actual power transformer windings.",
