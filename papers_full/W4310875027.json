Industry 4.0 is based on cyber-\nphysical systems (CPSs) and is distinguished by networking,\nwhich combines products, machines, and resources to create\na ﬂexible, personalized, digital, and networked manufactur-\ning mode using information technologies [1]–[3]. The CPS\nframework, however, ignores an important aspect of real-world\nindustrial systems: Social factor. However, the rapid develop-\nment of intelligent technologies such as artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI), internet of things (IoT), and extended reality (XR\n1)\ntoday not only increases industrial production efﬁciency, but\nalso brings social factors and actual industrial production\ncloser together [4], [5]. As a result, CPS, which cannot\neffectively deal with the complex social and human behaviors\nin increasingly complex industrial systems, impedes industrial\ndevelopment even further [1], [6]–[8].\nSo far, we can not help but wonder: “Should AI, XR,\nand many other new intelligent technologies be fully in-\ntegrated to establish a new industrial paradigm that fully\nﬂourishes productivity while adequately addressing upcoming\nchallenges?” To answer this question, Wang launched cyber-\nphysical-social systems (CPSSs) in 2010 [6], and further intro-\nduced the concept and framework of Industry 5.0 [1]. CPSS-\nbased Industry 5.0 builds a grand closed-loop control and\nmanagement paradigm for industry by incorporating complex\nsocial and human factors into the design and analysis of\nindustrial systems.

R\nELA TED WORK\nThis section provides a brief overview of parallel intel-\nligence and big AI models that are key technologies for\nconstructing parallel factories.\nA. Parallel Intelligence in Metaverses\nIt is not difﬁcult to discover that intelligent technologies\nsuch as AI, XR, and IoT all highlight a current buzzword:\nMetaverses. It is now widely recognized that the term “Meta-\nverse” was coined by Neal Stephenson in his science ﬁction\nnovel Snow Crash. Stephenson envisions the metaverse as\n1XR denotes technologies that can alter reality by adding digital elements\nto the user’s environment, including virtual reality, augmented reality, and\nmixed reality.\n2080 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMA TICA SINICA, VOL. 9, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2022\nIncreasing complexity increases GDP\nMechanical\nAtmospheric \nengine was the first \ncommercial steam \nengine using a piston, \nThomas Newcomen, \n1705.\nElectrical\nThe first DC Motor \nwas designed by \nZénobe Gramme, \n1869.\nInformation\nThe first PLC was \ndeveloped by \nDigital Equipment \nCorporation (DEC). \n(PDP-14, 1969)\nNetwork\nRouter\nCyber-Physical\nSystems\n(CPS, 2000)\n1700s 1870s 1970s 2000s The coming future\nComplexity\nParallel\nParallel Machine\nIntelligent Machine \n(CPSS, 2010)\nGDP\n0.3 Trillion\nGDP\n1 Trillion\nGDP\n6 Trillion\nGDP\n50 Trillion\nGDP\n100 Trillion?\nIndustry 1.0 Industry 5.0Industry 2.0 Industry 3.0 Industry 4.0\nFig. 1. From Industry 1.0 to Industry 5.0.\na virtual three-dimensional (3D) space in which everything\nin the real world is digitally replicated. Based on digital\ndoubles, people interact with other people or software-deﬁned\nagents for production and consumption. Before metaverses,\ndigital twins (DTs) were regarded as a critical technique for\nachieving Industry 4.0 [9], [10]. Although both metaverses\nand DTs attempt to duplicate the genuine physical world\nand then complete speciﬁc tasks, they both have signiﬁcant\nﬂaws when dealing with complex systems, according to the\ncurrent paradigm. Particularly, the CPS framework serves as\nthe foundation for metaverses and DT in the current paradigm.\nTherefore, related research disregards the social and human as-\npects of complex systems. [6]. Furthermore, there is currently\nno broadly recognized deﬁnition of metaverses, despite the fact\nthat it is frequently portrayed by features like interoperability,\nreal-time network access, and immersive 3D user experiences\n[11]. As a result, the metaverses lack a self-contained scientiﬁc\ntheory for control and management of complex systems.\nFortunately, several trailblazers have carried out some sig-\nniﬁcant research that explains and validates the metaverses.\nAmong these studies, parallel intelligence is the scientiﬁc\ntheory behind metaverses and DTs [12]–[16]. Parallel intel-\nligence is built on the parallel system theory [17]–[21]. The\nparallel system theory, proposed by Wang [17], is a scientiﬁc\nresearch paradigm for modeling, analysis, management, and\ncontrol of complex systems. The parallel system theory, also\nknown as the ACP theory, involves three main parts: Artiﬁcial\nsystems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution.\nArtiﬁcial systems are utilized to model the real world, which\nalso can be referred to as artiﬁcial societies. In computational\nexperiments, numerous intelligent methods can be employed to\ncope with complex systems. Based on the parallel execution,\nthe feedback from actual and artiﬁcial systems is obtained\nand analyzed to further improve the efﬁciency of modeling,\nmanagement, and control of complex systems. Based on the\nACP theory, parallel learning, which integrates descriptive\nlearning, predictive learning, and prescriptive learning, was\nintroduced to address complex system issues [22].\nB. Big AI Models\nThe success of big AI models (or foundation models [23])\nin natural language processing has received a lot of atten-\ntion in recent years [23]–[25]. In [26], BERT (Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers) was proposed\nActual Factories Artificial Factories\nManagement \nand control\nExperiments \nand Evaluation\nLearning \nand Training\nManagement \nand Control\nObservation \nand Evaluation\nControl and \nObservation \nManagement \nand Control\nObservation \nand Evaluation\nParallel Execution\nACP = Artificial Systems + Computational Experiments + Parallel Execution\nComputational Experiments\nFig. 2. The basic framework of QAII-1.0.\nand achieved then state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on\n11 different natural language processing tests, which initiated\nthe era of big AI models. In [27], the best one in the GPT\n(Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series so far: GPT-3,\nwhich has 175 billion parameters, was put forward to achieve\nbetter generality. A large-scale visual language (VL) pre-\ntraining model called CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-\ntraining) was proposed in [28], and it is trained by contrastive\nlearning. By predicting whether an image and a text are a\nmatch in pre-trained tasks, CLIP may be adapted to a variety\nof image and language downstream tasks. In [29], PaLM\n(Pathways Language Model), a Transformer model with 540\nbillion parameters, was proposed and achieved then SOTA\nperformance in multilingual tasks. Flamingo, a member of the\nVL models family, was introduced in [30], outperforming other\nwell-tuned large AI models at the time. Inspired by BERT,\nBEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Trans-\nformers) was introduced to pre-train vision Transformers using\nmasked image modeling pre-train tasks [31], and it could be\nquickly and easily applied to downstream vision tasks. More-\nover, in the ﬁeld of VL models, a minimal VL model: ViLT\n(Vision-and-Language Transformer) was proposed to reduce\nthe dependency on image feature extraction, by simplifying the\nprocessing of visual inputs, and ViLT is faster than previous\nVL models [32]. In [33], to enhance the performance of trans-\nferring models in a zero-shot fashion, LiT, namely Locked-\nimage Tuning, was proposed using contrastive-tuning methods.\nBriVL (Bridging-Vision-and-Language) was proposed in [34]\nas a method for obtaining multi-cognitive abilities and de-\nveloping general AI by leveraging weak semantic correlation\ndata. More details about big AI models can be found in [23].\nIt should be noted that the aforementioned big AI models\nwere created and implemented in ideal and secure settings,\nmaking it challenging to directly deploy them to real-world\nindustrial systems [35]–[37].\nIII. QAII-1.0: P\nARALLEL FACTORIES IN META VERSES\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we present a new\nsmart factory paradigm in industrial metaverses: QAII-1.02.\nFigs. 2 and 3 depict the basic framework and the operating\n2Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries (QAII) is rooted in independent\ninnovations and promotes the commercialization of scientiﬁc and technolog-\nical achievements.

The operating framework of QAII-1.0.\nframework of QAII-1.0, which is designed based on the ACP\ntheory and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\nprinciple. The main goal of QAII-1.0 is, under the condition\nof human-machine collaboration, to direct intelligent indus-\ntrial equipment to accomplish various scenarios-oriented tasks\nthrough the cooperation of actual and virtual factories. Specif-\nically, QAII-1.0 includes the following three steps: 1)Artiﬁcial\nsystems: To get around problems like non-reproducibility,\nexpensive physical tests, and difﬁculty assuring safety for\nactual factories, construct artiﬁcial factories; 2)Computational\nexperiments: Conduct computational experiments based on\nartiﬁcial and actual factories for analyses, evaluation, and\nprediction; 3) Parallel execution: Through parallel execution,\nartiﬁcial and real factories are intimately interwoven to achieve\nguidance, management, and control of actual factories.\nTo enhance the intelligence of industrial systems, we pro-\npose a scenarios engineering (SE) + ﬁeld foundational models\n(FFMs) approach. Traditional feature engineering-based AI\nmethods have attained SOTA performance on some spe-\nciﬁc tasks, but without the in-depth consideration of issues\nsuch as interpretability, security, and sustainability [36], [37].\nTherefore, it is difﬁcult to apply these SOTA methods to\nactual industrial systems directly. In parallel factories, SE\ncan be viewed as the integration of industrial scenarios and\noperations within a certain temporal and spatial range, where\nsuitable AI methods are to complete the design, certiﬁcation,\nand veriﬁcation. The design, validation, and calibration for\nindustrial operations will be supported by intelligence & index\n(I&I), calibration & certiﬁcation (C&C), and veriﬁcation &\nvalidation (V&V) under the framework of SE, and QAII-\n1.0 can then achieve the 6S (safety, security, sustainability,\nsensitivity, service, and smartness) goal [36].\nBig AI models are crucial to achieving parallel factories.\nHowever, as stated previously, the existing big AI models\nare designed based on feature engineering and are therefore\ndifﬁcult to straightforwardly apply to actual industrial oper-\nations. Fortunately, with the help of SE, we can establish\nactual industrial operations as scenarios-oriented models based\non the industrial data and knowledge to accurately describe\nindustrial production. Then, we construct an FFM to support\nsmart industrial operations using I&I, C&C, and V&V . The\nterm “FFM” refers to this type of big model that is built on\nSE and targeted towards a particular ﬁeld. More details on the\ncombination of SE and FFM inQAII-1.0 will be illustrated in\nthe next section.\nMeanwhile, QAII-1.0 has the following three operation\nmodes: 1) Control & management: In this mode, artiﬁcial\nand actual factories interact in real-time, and achieve sensing,\nprediction, management, and control through parallel execu-\ntion; 2) Experimentation & evaluation: In this mode, analyses,\nevaluations, and optimization of various scenarios, planning,\nand management schemes are carried out; 3) Learning &\ntraining: In this mode, learning and training are conducted\nmainly for managers, planners, and workers in factories.\nBased on the operating framework, Fig. 4 further illustrates\nthe architecture of QAII-1.0. This architecture includes the\nfollowing ﬁve layers: the support layer, the data interaction\nlayer, the FFM layer, the digital operation layer, and the\napplication layer, and each layer is coupled with the other\nfrom the bottom up.

E\nUARTISAN :T OW ARDSE AND FFM FOR SMART\nINDUSTRIAL OPERA TIONS\nAs mentioned earlier, improving the intelligence of current\nindustrial systems is necessary to achieve QAII-1.0. To this\nend, we present EuArtisan, a SE-based FFM for intelligent\nindustrial operations. The basic framework of EuArtisan is\ndepicted in Fig. 5, and it consists of the following blocks:\nSE-based scenario modeling block, single modal feature ex-\ntraction, hybrid multimodal features and knowledge fusion\nblock, pre-trained tasks block, and adaptation to downstream\napplications block. In the following, we will give details of\nthese blocks.\nSE-based scenario modeling block. Big AI models require\nenormous amounts of data to train, and their application\nin industry can be even more challenging. In the case of\nindustrial scenarios, the data to be processed will be more\ncomplex, and we frequently have to deal with multimodal data,\nunstructured data, and incomplete data. Another issue is that\nit is difﬁcult to model a wide variety of industrial systems in\nan analytical way. To address the aforementioned issues, we\npropose a SE-based scenario modeling approach. According\nto SE, we establish a scenario base, which includes industrial\nrules, expert knowledge, and multimodal data, to precisely\ndescribe industrial operations. Then, based on the I&I, C&C,\nand V&V framework, we design EuArtisan to support smart\nindustrial operations.

Finally,\nwe can obtain the SE-based industrial knowledge graph and\ntokenized data.\nSingle modal feature extraction block and hybrid mul-\ntimodal features and knowledge fusion block. Since Eu-\nArtisan needs to handle big multimodal data, two blocks are\ndesigned for feature extraction. In the single modal feature\nextraction block, we use the self-attention mechanism to\ninitially extract features from single modal data. All industrial\noperations in a factory should be highly connected given that\nthey all eventually go toward the same objective, and thus\nfeatures and knowledge behind operations should be strongly\ncorrelated. Therefore, it is not enough to do feature extraction\nonly for single modal data. On the other hand, since different\ntasks require different data, it is not necessary to fuse all\nthe features in one task, which can result in computational\nredundancy. To further extract features in multimodal data\nand attain hybrid multimodal features, we propose a hybrid\nmultimodal attention (HMA). In HMA, whether or not a\nspeciﬁc feature is involved in the feature fusion is decided by\nan HM module. Moreover, the SE industrial knowledge graph\nis included to improveEuArtisan’s performance for particular\nindustrial tasks, a process known as knowledge integration.\nPre-trained task block. Pre-trained task design is a critical\nstep to achieving big AI models, andEuArtisan is no excep-\ntion. First, pre-training tasks should be relevant to downstream\ntasks to ensure the effectiveness of the feature extraction.\nSecond, it is challenging to manually label data because the\ntraining of big models requires vast amounts of data. For\nexample, in [26], two pre-trained tasks are proposed for BERT\nusing self-supervised learning: Masked-language modeling\nand next sentence prediction. Based on the above analyses,\nwe can design the following pre-training tasks: Operation trend\nprediction, control generation, fault classiﬁcation, and tasks in\nvirtual space.\nIn actual factories, various intelligent sensors generate a\nvast amount of operational data, and we can predict operation\ntrends using self-supervised learning. It is worth noting that,\nin standard industrial system modeling, a neural network is\nusually utilized to predict the next state based on the current\nstate and action, i.e., predicting a Markov decision process.\nThe goal is to train a neural network to satisfy a certain\nmapping, and the mathematical expression is as follows:\nf :( s,a) → s\n′ (1)\nwhere s and a denote the current state and action of an\nindustrial system, respectively, and s′ denotes the next step\nstate. The proposed operation trend prediction is far different\nfrom this way. Assuming we have two motors, each with a\ndifferent set of parameters, if we follow (1) to train a neural\nnetwork, the same (s,a) may correspond to differents\n′. The\ncase of the same data corresponding to different labels may\nlead to unsatisfactory training results. Therefore, we construct\nthe following mathematical expression in the operation trend\nprediction:\n¯f :( ¯s,¯a) → ¯s\n′ (2)\nwhere ¯s and ¯a denote the sequence of current states and\nactions of an industrial system, respectively, and ¯s′ denotes\nthe sequence of next period states. Our goal is to extract\nmore features contained in systems by using a period of\n2084 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMA TICA SINICA, VOL. 9, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2022\nruntime data. Furthermore, by substituting (s,a) with two\nsimilar devices, we can forecast the dynamics of another\ndifferent class of related devices by mining features of the\ntwo associated devices mentioned above.\nAs for the control generation and fault classiﬁcation, we\ncan get labels from the scenario base and expert knowledge.\nRegarding the tasks in virtual space, the training data and\nlabels are generally coupled together at the time of data\ngeneration and no further manual labels are required.\nAdaptation to downstream applications block. Once our\nmodel has been pre-trained, we may ﬁne-tune it to meet partic-\nular downstream applications and keep it constantly learning.\nBesides, the ﬁne-tuned model will be applied to digital virtual\nmodels concurrently, and the cloud system will continuously\ntrack and analyze the performance of both the actual system\nand the digital virtual models. When the performance is not\nas expected, the model and the digital virtual models will be\nfurther updated simultaneously. It is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd out\nthat the implementation of EuArtisan adheres to the rule of\n“Local simple remote complex”.\nV. A\nPPLICA TION:P ARALLEL OIL FIELDS IN META VERSES\nThis section introduces a speciﬁc application of parallel\nfactories: Parallel oil ﬁelds. Parallel oil ﬁelds, as depicted\nin Fig. 6, primarily consist of actual oil ﬁelds, artiﬁcial\noil ﬁelds, EuArtisan, and high performance computing envi-\nronments. Throughout the life cycle, parallel oil ﬁelds sup-\nport industrial operations such as geological survey, seismic\nexploration, drilling, mud logging, well logging, casing &\ncementing, completion, oil extraction, enhanced oil recovery\n(EOR), transportation, and oil-reﬁnery. Parallel oil ﬁelds aim\nto optimize the efﬁciency of operations, save energy, reduce\nworker engagement in the actual oil production, achieve an\nincrease in oil production, and develop intelligent oil ﬁelds\nwhile ensuring safety and reliability.\nParallel oil ﬁelds also involve the following three steps:\n1) Artiﬁcial oil ﬁelds: Establish multi-scale and multi-\ndimensional digital virtual models of actual oil ﬁelds, such\nas reservoir geological model, drilling model, digital staff\nmodel, and sucker rod pumping system (SRPS) model, and\nprovide the fundamental components for simulations and com-\nputational experiments; 2) Computational experiments: For\ngeological survey, mud logging, oil extraction, EOR, etc.,\ncomputational experiments provide the experimental platform\nemploying digital virtual models and assist in optimizing\nindustrial operations; 3) Parallel execution: We optimize ar-\ntiﬁcial oil ﬁelds and computational experiment results through\nparallel execution.\nIn parallel oil ﬁelds, EuArtisan is utilized to offer intel-\nlectual support. First, EuArtisan gathers operational data and\nknowledge from artiﬁcial and actual oil ﬁelds. An oil ﬁeld is\na typical case of big data and multimodal data, data including\nseismic images, SEG-Y , downhole videos, drilling daily re-\nports (DDRs), and PVT (pressure, volume, and temperature).\nData formats include temporal series, videos, two-dimensional\n(2D)/3D images, natural language, and expert knowledge. To\nensure secure and effective data usage, SE must be employed.\nIn order to adequately depict oil ﬁeld operations, we establish\nthe oil scenario basis based on SE, which includes industrial\nrules, expert knowledge, and multimodal data. We also get\ntokenized data and the knowledge graph for the oil industry\nat the same time. Additionally, we develop appropriate pre-\ntrained tasks to extract features from multimodal data in\noil ﬁelds in accordance with downstream tasks. Furthermore,\na high-performance computing environment is required for\nengineering applications.\nNext, we will give a brief description of two operations: well\nlogging and oil extraction. Well logging, also called borehole\nlogging, is a process of measuring geophysical parameters\nusing the geophysical properties of rock formations such\nas electrochemical properties, electrical conductivity, acoustic\nproperties, and radioactivity. In short, well logging is the\nmeasurement of physical parameters of stratigraphic rocks. In\noil extraction, the underground crude oil is extracted to the\nsurface according to requirements of oil ﬁeld development. It\nis not difﬁcult to ﬁnd out that well logging and oil extraction\nare related. The properties of reservoir rocks, for example,\nmight determine the method of oil extraction, such as ﬂowing\noil production and artiﬁcial lift. The mechanical and kinematic\nparameters of lift devices used in artiﬁcial lift methods are also\nclosely related to the properties of the rock formation.\nIn the following, we illustrate the above operations in\nparallel oil ﬁelds. In artiﬁcial oil ﬁelds, we establish virtual\nreservoir well models which describe reservoir properties and\nvirtual artiﬁcial lift devices. In computational experiments,\nthese virtual models offer simulation conditions and can also\nproduce virtual data to make up for the absence of actual\ndata from oil ﬁelds. As mentioned above, the two operations\nare related, and from the perspective of machine learning, the\nfeatures required for the two operations can be shared. The\ntraining process involves feeding EuArtisan data from both\noperations, such as γ-ray, spontaneous potential, and motor\ndriving torque in SPRS.EuArtisan is then trained using elab-\norate pre-trained tasks. Recalling that pre-trained tasks should\nbe relevant to downstream tasks and should be self-supervised,\nprediction tasks, tasks in the expert knowledge base, and tasks\nin virtual space are appropriate. For example, 2D/3D image-\nbased permeability prediction, porosity prediction, prediction\nof SPRS motion characteristics, indicator diagram-based fault\nclassiﬁcation in fault knowledge base, and tasks in virtual\nspace. Once EuArtisan has received adequate training, we can\nﬁne-tune it to ﬁt the downstream tasks in well logging and\noil extraction. Besides, the ﬁne-tuned EuArtisan is applied\nto artiﬁcial and actual oil ﬁelds concurrently, and the cloud\nsystem will continuously track, analyze, and improve the\nperformance of both the actual and artiﬁcial oil ﬁelds.\nVI. C\nONCLUSION\nGoing back to the question at the beginning of this paper,\nour answer is self-evident: “Yes!”. To this end, based on SE\nand FFM, we present a new paradigm for parallel factories\nin metaverses: QAII-1.0, which offers a secure and reliable\nguarantee for the application of AI, XR, DAO, web 3.0,\nblockchain, and many other new intelligent technologies in\nLU et al.: PARALLEL FACTORIES FOR SMART INDUSTRIAL OPERA TIONS: FROM BIG AI MODELS TO FFMS AND SE 2085\nControl & ManagementExperimentation & EvaluationLearning & Training\nArtificial Oil Fields in CloudActual Oil Fields\nHigh Performance\nComputing Environment\nDAO, Web 3.0, Blockchain, XR, 5G \nCloud/Edge Computing, IoT, Big Data\nHigh Performance\nComputing Environment\nDAO, Web 3.0, Blockchain, XR, 5G \nCloud/Edge Computing, IoT, Big Data\nParallel\nExecution\nEuArtisan\nOil Field Knowledge Oil Field Data Sources\nDDR\nParallel Oil Fields in Industrial Metaverses\n SEG-Y Reservoir & \nFluid Data PVT Data ĂĂFault \nKnowledge \nEOR \nKnowledge ĂĂ\nGeological Survey Seismic Exploration Drilling Mud Logging Well Logging\nCasing & Cementing Completion Casing & Cementing Oil Extraction ĂĂ\nSE-Based \nScenario Modeling HMA Mechanism Pre-trained Tasks\nReservoir Model\nFluid Flow & \nGeomechanical Model\nDigital Staff\nĂĂ\nDrilling Artificial Lift\nMotors SRPS ĂĂ\nExploration & \nProduction\nFig. 6.

Then, an FFM calledEuArti-\nsan is introduced in QAII-1.0 to achieve high-level machine\nintelligence for industrial systems. The design, certiﬁcation,\nand veriﬁcation for EuArtisan are implemented based on SE,\nand adhere to the DAO principle. Finally, parallel oil ﬁelds\nare given to demonstrate the operating procedure ofQAII-1.0.\nWe believe the combination ofQAII-1.0 and EuArtisan is the\nkey to achieving smart industrial operations in Industry 5.0.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe idea of parallel factories was ﬁrst proposed by Prof. Fei-\nY ue Wang in the early 2000s. After 20 years of development,\nit has been practiced and applied in many ﬁelds, such as\nparallel ethylene plants, parallel nuclear power plants, and\nparallel thermal power stations. In this work, we further\nintegrate the idea of FFM and SE, which are also proposed\nby Prof. Fei-Y ue Wang, into parallel factories, developing and\nexpanding the idea with new concepts and technologies. Since\nthe idea is proposed, several symposiums, workshops, and\nseminars have been organized to explore the architecture, key\ntechnologies, and applications of parallel factories, andQAII-\n1.0 and EuArtisan were gradually formed. We would like to\nthank Prof. Fei-Y ue Wang, for leaving no stone unturned to\nshare his perspective and knowledge with us, which greatly\nimproved this work.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natu-\nral Science Foundation of China (1811463, 62073321) and\nModeling, Decision and Control Algorithms for Servo Drive\nSystems.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] F.-Y .
