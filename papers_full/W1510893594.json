This integration has given rise to two \n\nDarío Luis Banegas \n112 \nbroad approaches: (a) CBI (content-based instruction), and (b) CLIL (content \nand language integrated learning) (Dalton-Puffer & Smit, 2007, p. 7-24).  \nIn this paper, I examine the central features of CBI and CLIL by looking at \ntheir components, definitions, models, underpinning rationale and implemen-\ntation outcomes found in the literature under the light of sociocultural theory. \nI review the benefits and challenges of this so-called innovative approach \n(Kiely, 2011) so as to encourage critically context-responsive endeavours. \n \nSociocultural underpinnings in CBI-CLIL \n \nA sociocultural theory perspective is usually developed to understand \nthe relationship between learning, language, and content. Language is the \nmediating tool through which content and language are co-constructed in a \nlearning environment (Moate, 2010). This integration could also become more \ncomplex when learners focus on language-focused talk as well as content-\nfocused talk. It is through these interrelations that learners begin to engage in \ntasks which require complex language derived from curricular complex rela-\ntions (Kong, 2009, p. 239-248).  \nH o w e v e r , a w o r d o f c a u t i o n i s a d v a n c e d b y P i c a ( 2 0 0 2 ) . I n a w e l l -\ngrounded empirical research study, the author sought to identify ways in which \nteachers modified interaction about content. Although integration may become \nsuccessful when it responds to learners’ interests, Pica states that a strong focus \non meaning and function, an activity which may presuppose the overlook of \nform, could deprive learners of improving their language proficiency. What Pica \n(2002) fears is that language learning will be incidental and errors may never be \nc o r rec t e d . I n t u rn , t h is m ay a f f ec t l ea rn e rs a s t h e y w ill ac q u ir e n e w c u r r ic u l a r \ncontent without receiving language feedback and support so that both compo-\nn e n t s o f t h e i n t e g r a t i o n b e n e f i t f r o m e a c h o t h e r . I f t h i s d o e s n o t h a p p e n , a t \nsome point, poor language development will block content learning.   \nWhen considering the links between sociocultural theory and second \nlanguage acquisition, authors such as Lantolf (2000), Lantolf and Thorne \n(2006), and Warford (2010) assert that the human mind is mediated through \nphysical and symbolic tools, such as language, which mediate the relationship \nbetween us and the objects of our experience. One example of mediation is \nteacher talk in interaction (Kong, 2009; Moate, 2010, p. 40-41; Short, 2002; \nTasker, Johnson, & Davis, 2010, p. 130), which scaffolds the appropriation of \nscientific concepts, cultural knowledge, and linguistic knowledge (Barranco \nPérez, 2007; Mohan, 1986, p. 2; Mohan & Slater, 2005). Gibbons (2002, p. 10) \ndefines scaffolding as a special kind of help by which the teacher temporarily \nassists learners while they perform different tasks so that, in the future, they \nIntegrating content and language in English language teaching in secondary education: Models . . . \n113 \ncan become autonomous and work on their own. Scaffolding can take the \nform of asking questions, activating prior knowledge, creating a motivating \ncontext, encouraging participation, offering hints, and feedback. It may also \ninclude adapting materials to respond to learners’ needs (Guerrini, 2009, p. \n74; Reiss, 2005, p. 6-8) while fostering students’ higher order mental capaci-\nties and cognitive content engagement (Hall, 2010, p. 213; Kong & Hoare, \n2011, p. 310; Lyster & Ballinger, 2011, p. 283).  \nWithin CBI-CLIL, for example, Llinares & Whittaker (2009, p. 78-85) sug-\ngest that content could be scaffolded when it is linked to students’ personal \nexperiences, previous content taught in their L1, or through skills work in tasks \n(Mehisto, Marsh, & Frigols, 2008, p. 139-140). Along these lines, CLIL and CBI \nare examples of reversing the focus on language to urging teachers to attend \nto the role of content in scaffolding second language learning (Bailey, Burkett, \n& Freeman, 2010, p. 615). This assistance occurs in what is known as the zone \nof proximal development or ZPD (de Guerrero & Villamil, 2000, pp. 51-52; \nMehisto, 2008, p. 109; Ohta, 2005, pp. 505-506). However, I believe that \nteachers need to ensure that scaffolding only acts as a safe net for the intro-\nduction of new content (Coyle, Hood, & Marsh, 2010). If the CLIL lesson is only \nreduced to the repetition of the L1 curriculum in another language, motivation \nand cognitive engagement may be threatened. \nLast, Richards and Rodgers (2001, p. 204-215) agree with Larsen-\nFreeman (2000, p. 140) on the fact that people learn another language more \nsuccessfully when they acquire information through it. Richards and Rodgers \n(2001, p. 215) also point out that CBI has two major goals: autonomous learn-\ning (cf. Wolff, 2003, p. 211-215), and the adoption of different roles by learn-\ners such as interpreter, explorer, source of content, and joint participant in \ncontent and activity selection. By advancing these aims, the idea that learning \nand teaching content and language should be seen as collaborative work be-\ntween educators and learners is once again established on solid ground. \n \nDefining Language in CBI-CLIL \n \nIn this section I outline what is usually meant by language and content, \nan enterprise which could be rather difficult (Davidson, 2005, pp. 220-221; \nHermann, 2008). On the language side and illuminated by sociocultural theory, \nmost researchers (Cammarata, 2009, p. 561-562; Coyle, Hood, & Marsh, 2010, \np. 37; Creese, 2005, p. 190; Kong, 2009, p. 234; Mohan & Slater, 2005, pp. 153-\n155) agree that language plays a functional role in CBI-CLIL because it serves as \na medium to learn a school subject embedded in formal education. In effect, \nlanguage is seen as a conduit for communication and for learning (Coyle, \nDarío Luis Banegas \n114 \nHood, & Marsh, 2010, p. 54). This functional view of language is associated \nwith the concept of communicative competence (Hymes, 1972), which has \nbeen further developed in relation to CLIL by several authors (Brown, 2007, p. \n218-222; Dalton-Puffer, 2009; Davidson, 2005, p. 220; Lotherington, 2004, p. \n707; Nunan, 2004, p. 212; Savignon, 2007). It entails the learning of new dis-\ncourses, such as mathematical discourse (Hofmannová, Novotná, & Pípalová, \n2008, p. 23). Bentley (2010, p. 11) proposes that learners should know con-\ntent-obligatory language and content-compatible language to cater for the \ndifference between subject-specific and general discourse. In my view, such a \nsuggestion seems to respond to content-driven approaches (see pp. 119-121) \nas students’ content knowledge will be prioritised in their assessment.   \nIn connection with discourses and a functional view of language, Coyle \n(2007b, p. 53) developed a Language Triptych to represent how language may \nbe progressively learnt and used through interrelated perspectives. One per-\nspective is language of learning, that is, the learning of key words and phrases \nto access content. Secondly, language for learning focuses on the language \nstudents will need to carry out classroom tasks such as debating, or organising \nand presenting information. Last, language through learning  makes room for \nunpredictable language learning as it is concerned with new language emerg-\ning from the cognitive process students are engaged in. All in all, the triptych \no f f e r s b o t h a f o c u s o n f o r m ( c f . S p ad a , 2 0 1 0 ) a n d a f o c u s o n m e a n in g . T h i s \nmeans that a lesson can be enriched if students not only identify tenses and \nhow grammar patterns work but, simultaneously, put those grammatical items \nto meaningful use by learning content about other school subjects, for in-\nstance. Grammar may still be taught incidentally and explicitly depending on \ncontextual circumstances and also recycled and assigned true meaning by in-\nviting students to embed content into words. However, teachers and students \nsometimes suspect that language learning may only benefit those students \nwho have received EFL instruction or private lessons through a more gram-\nmar-oriented or coursebook-driven approach (Banegas, in press). In this sense, \nCLIL may be seen as elitist as it only benefits those who already know the lan-\nguage to some extent. \n \nDefining Content in CBI-CLIL \n \nContent may be identified with nonlanguage subjects or scientific disci-\nplines (Wolff, 2010, p. 103) “packaged in some way” (Morton, 2010, p. 98). \nSuch a feature, however, may be hard to achieve. For example, Rogers (2000) \ncriticises content-basics adherents for not defining the type and quantity of \ncontent to be explored. This position demands active and independent in-\nIntegrating content and language in English language teaching in secondary education: Models . . . \n115 \nvolvement of teachers and school authorities interested in developing an \nadaptable curriculum for the integration of content and language (Wolff, \n2010, p. 104-107). After all, the essential feature of CBI-CLIL should be that the \ncontent addressed truly emerges from students’ L1 school curriculum. \nBarwell (2005, pp. 143-144) suggests the use of subject area instead of \ncontent since the latter could be merely seen as the product of contextualised \nteacher-learner interaction. His view is that content may be perceived as an \nexternal entity detached from the language which may lead to no language \nexploration. He also argues that if language is only the medium of instruction, \nnot only is its status diminished in the integration, but also a rather false mes-\ns a g e c a n b e c o n v e y e d : T h a t l a n g u a g e i s d e v o i d o f c o n t e n t . I f t h i s v i e w i s \nstrengthened, then language learning will be merely incidental (Langman, \n2003, p. 4). Paz and Quinterno (2009, p. 28) assert that language is content \nand its content is grammar, phonology, semantics, and skills development. \nPerhaps these fears could be minimised by the discursification of language in \nthe sense that language, even when it plays a functional role, could be taught \nby looking at how specific discourses are constructed. \nIn a similar vein, Mohan and Slater (2005, p. 155) admit that defining con-\ntent and language from the point of view of integration is debatable. They solve \nthis intricacy by resorting to a functional view of language as it offers a broader \nperspective where meaning, functions and context are considered. The authors \nadd that while content is the meaning of a discourse, such as science discourse, \nlanguage is the wording of a discourse. This view requires that learners need to \nunderstand what is being meant, a school subject or curricular content, and on \nthe other hand, how that meaning is worded in language, thus offering learners \nthe possibility of paying close attention to how a language works.  \nLast, Coyle, Hood, & Marsh (2010, p. 42, 53) stress that language learn-\ning with its focus on form and meaning should not be reduced to incidental or \nunplanned grammar. With this position in mind they stress that content, ini-\ntially related to a discrete curriculum discipline, needs to be seen as beyond \nknowledge acquisition. For these authors, content is related to cognition, thus, \nwe should also see it as skills development and understanding which leads to \nstudent-generated knowledge.  \nIn sum, language may be viewed as a scaffolding tool, with its own con-\nt e n t a s a s y s t e m , w h i c h c a n b e u s e d t o e x p r e s s f u n c t i o n a l m e a n i n g s , s u c h a s \nnarrating, describing a process, comparing sources, expressing opinions, or ex-\nchanging information. Conversely, content is an abbreviation of curricular con-\ntent from subjects such as History, Geography, Biology, or Economics among \nothers. However, content should also include language as a system of subsys-\ntems, as an object of study positioned in systemic functional linguistics. CBI and \nDarío Luis Banegas \n116 \nC L I L f e a t u r e d i f f e r e n t c o m b i n a t i o n s o f t h e s e t w o c o m p o n e n t s . W h a t m a y l i n k \nboth language and content is discourse in the sense that this latter will dictate \nwhat will be learnt and through which specific subject-related discourse. How-\never, what specific contents may be used is not clear-cut (see pp. 123-126). \n \nContent-Based Instruction \n \nCBI is distinguished by its dual commitment to language and content \nlearning objectives (Stoller, 2004, p. 261). In general terms, the roots of this \ndual commitment to language and curricular content take us back to the Ca-\nnadian immersion programmes in the 1960s (Ramos, 2009, p. 172). At the \ntime and even during the 1970s and 1980s, Canada implemented a French \nimmersion project throughout schooling so that English-speaking learners \ncould learn French by studying curricular subjects in French. Stryke & Leaver \n(1997, p. 270) define CBI as an approach in which language proficiency is \nachieved by focusing on learning curricular subject-matter through the lan-\nguage to be learnt. Following this same stance but broadening the scope, Brin-\nton, Snow, and Wesche (2003, p. ix) view CBI as the concurrent study of both \nlanguage and subject matter, where the content material will dictate how lan-\nguage will be sequenced and therefore presented.  \nIn countries such as Canada and the USA, CBI has gained popularity as \nthe demographics of second language student populations are changing dra-\nmatically due to the arrival of non-English-speaking migrants into English-\nspeaking communities thus putting pressure on educational systems (Dalton-\nPuffer, 2007, pp. 1-2). This phenomenon of transnationalism is impinged upon \nby socio-political circumstances such as the seeking of job opportunities, polit-\nical asylum, or living standards (Ramos, 2009, pp. 169-170). Therefore, these \nnew learners are placed in mainstream classrooms where subject-matter is \ninstructed in English so that they learn both simultaneously (Cammarata, \n2009, p. 561; Crandall, 1993; Stoller, 2004, p. 262; Wesche, 2001). CBI has \nbeen implemented throughout the whole Canadian educational system as \nnewcomers are found in primary, secondary, as well as university education \n(Swain & Johnson, 1997, p. 1).  \n \nContent and Language Integrated Learning \n \nOriginated and developed in Europe, (Dafouz & Guerrini, 2009; Lorenzo, \nCasal, & Moore, 2010, p. 436; Wolff, 2007, p. 15-16), CLIL can be traced to the \nGerman-Franco programmes’ interest in bilingualism and supranational edu-\ncation (Lorenzo, Casal, & Moore, 2010, p. 419). In 1994 David Marsh intro-\nIntegrating content and language in English language teaching in secondary education: Models . . . \n117 \nduced the acronym CLIL (Eurydice 2006, p. 8; Lucietto, 2008, p. 29). CLIL is an \napproach in which various methodologies are used to achieve a dual-focused \nform of instruction in language and content. Furthermore, CLIL researchers \nuse the term umbrella and several definitions (Costa & D’Angelo, 2011; \nHaataja, 2007a, p. 9) to refer to the curricular variations prescribed in Europe \n(Bentley, 2010, p. 5-7; Dalton-Puffer, Nikula, & Smit, 2010; Lorenzo, Casal, & \nMoore, 2010, p. 419; Marsh & Wolff, 2007).  \nMarsh’s generic concept was welcomed by the European Union. The \nCouncil of Europe has included CLIL projects in its medium-term programmes \ndue to the interest in developing the plurilingual competence of their citizens \n(Dalton-Puffer, 2007, pp. 1-2; Marsh, 2002) through intercomprehension, \ninterculturalism, and plurilingualism (de Carlo, 2009; Sudhoff, 2010). This \nplurilingual competence may be developed through a framework which facili-\ntates the interrelationship between subject-matter knowledge and language \nknowledge through communication, culture and cognition (Coyle, 2006; Pérez-\nVidal, 2009, pp. 8-9); or as Coyle (2007a, p. 551, 2007b, p. 51) puts it, through \na philosophical stance which has given rise to her practical and overarching \n4Cs framework integrated by content, communication, cognition and culture \nwhere these four are holistically considered in various models. However, Dal-\nton-Puffer (2011) argues that most international implementations are in Eng-\nlish and therefore it would be better to speak of CEIL (content and English \nintegrated learning) instead of CLIL.   \n \nCBI-CLIL as a Continuum of Models \n \nBoth CBI and CLIL offer multiple models and approaches which could be \nseen as a continuum which goes from a focus on foreign or second language \nlearning, at one end, to a greater interest in curricular instruction through an L2, \nat the other end. The proposal of a continuum (Table 1) was initially suggested \nby Met (1999) and then expanded by Brinton, Snow, and Wesche (2003; see \nalso Hernández Herrero, 2005; Wesche & Skehan, 2002, pp. 207-228).  \nThe CBI-CLIL continuum signals that there is no single pedagogy or mod-\nel for integrating content and language (Coyle, Hood, & Marsh, 2010, p. 86; \nRuiz-Garrido & Fortanet-Gómez, 2009, pp. 180-181). Coyle, Hood, and Marsh \n(2010, p. 14-26), for example, paint a clear and concise picture of general cur-\nricular models across educational levels and countries. In secondary education \nin particular, these authors suggest five models: dual-school education, bilin-\ngual education, interdisciplinary module approach, language based projects, \nand specific-domain vocational CLIL. While the former models stress the con-\ntent side, language-based projects are different as it is the language teacher \nDarío Luis Banegas \n118 \nwho teaches new content in the EFL lesson. They all testify that we may shape \nCLIL according to contextual needs, resources and aims (Marsh, 2008, p. 236). \nFurthermore, they all confirm that to expect an approach to deal with content \nand language on equal terms is simply an illusion.  \n \nTable 1 Continuum of language-content integration (adapted from Met, 1999)  \nContent-driven Language-driven \nContent is taught in L2. \nContent learning is priority. \nLanguage learning is secondary. \nContent objectives determined by course goals \nor curriculum. \nTeachers must select language objectives. \nStudents evaluated on content mastery. \nContent is used to learn L2. \nLanguage learning is priority. \nContent learning is incidental. \nLanguage objectives determined by L2 course \ngoals or curriculum. \nStudents evaluated on content to be integrated. \nStudents evaluated on language \nskills/proficiency. \n \nThis co ntinuum h as p ro ved usefu l as it co vers all th e different cu rricu lar \nmodels used for language-content integration in countries such as Canada, Chi-\nna, England, Japan, Spain, or the USA (Ballman, 1997, p. 174-175; Butler, 2005, \np. 229; Cammarata, 2009, p. 561; Johnson, 2008, p. 172-173; Kong, 2009, p. 234; \nRodgers, 2006; Ruiz de Zarobe, 2008, p. 61-62). Met’s continuum has been used \nto describe the range of settings that CBI, CLIL or CBLT (content-based language \nteaching) entail (Lyster & Ballinger, 2011, p. 280). This encompassing view has \nimpacted on several countries due to the fact that its broadening scope has \nattracted an international interest (Banegas, 2011; Bebenroth & Redfield, 2004; \nStoller, 2004, p. 293) in implementing content-language integration projects \nsuch as GLOBE (Kennedy, 2006) at all educational levels.  \nFollowing a sociocultural perspective, it may be suggested that in lan-\nguage-driven approaches, content may be seen as a mediating tool for lan-\nguage learning. Brinton, Snow, and Wesche (2003, pp. 14-15) place theme-\nbased instruction as one curricular model which could be implemented in edu-\ncational contexts where nonlanguage teachers are not in a position to teach in \nthe L2. Theme-based instruction then occurs within the ESL/EFL or any other \ntarget language course and though the context is given by specific content \nareas, the focus of assessment is on language skills and functions (Lorenzo, \nCasal, & Moore, 2010, p. 421; Navés, 2009; Yassin, Tek, Alimon, Baharom, & \nYing, 2010, pp. 47-48). A theme-based course is structured around unrelated \ntopics which provide the context for language instruction. This model bears \nsome resemblances to cross-curricular projects (Harris, 2008; Savage, 2011, \npp. 404-442) and also to English across the curriculum , where language teach-\ne r s m a y w o r k t o g e t h e r w i t h a c o n t e n t t e a c h e r o n a p a r t i c u l a r t o p i c . I n E a s t \nIntegrating content and language in English language teaching in secondary education: Models . . . \n119 \nAsia and South America, for example, the purpose of theme-based instruction \nis to provide students with meaningful input so that they can develop a more \nencompassing use of their English through cognitive engagement (Banegas, \n2 0 1 1 ; B u t l e r , 2 0 0 5 , p . 2 3 4 ; K o n g & H o a r e , 2 0 1 1 ) . N e v e r t h e l e s s , o n e o f i t s \ndrawbacks is that teachers do not generally follow a set of themes derived \nfrom one curricular subject. Instead, they address themes from Biology, Histo-\nry, Culture, and Geography among others, thus offering small content blocks \n(Rogers, 2000). Furthermore, this may create confusion as the boundaries \nbetween a traditional topic-based approach and a CLIL approach appear un-\nclear and teachers may believe that CLIL is another buzz term for something \nthey have done before (Banegas, in press). \nOther language-driven approaches may include the adjunct model and \nlanguage for specific purposes. The adjunct model (Met, 1999) combines a lan-\nguage course with a content course. Both courses share the same content base \nand the aim is to help learners at university level master academic content, ma-\nterials, as well as language skills. A similar stance is evidenced in the language \nfor specific purposes models (Ruiz-Garrido & Fortanet-Gómez, 2009).  \nConversely, content-driven approaches may be said to utilise language \nas a mediating tool for content learning. Content-driven approaches may in-\nclude single or dual, semi or total immersion (Dalton-Puffer, 2007; Grabe & \nStoller, 1997, p. 80), bilingual education, and translanguaging, that is, the abil-\nity of multilingual students to shuttle between languages while treating them \nas an integrated system (Canagarajah, 2011, p. 401; Creese & Blackledge, \n2010). The sheltered-content approach also belongs to this group as it consists \nof a content course taught by a content area specialist in the target language \nusing authentic materials (Rodgers, 2006, p. 373-375).  \nSecondary schools in the Basque country have implemented CLIL in or-\nder to promote bilingual education, a content-driven approach, par excel-\nl e n c e . A s p a r t o f a l o n g i t u d i n a l p r o j e c t s e e k i n g t o i n v e s t i g a t e w h e t h e r C L I L \nleads to faster foreign language learning among teenage learners in secondary \neducation in the Basque country, Ruiz de Zarobe (2008, p. 63) describes three \nlinguistic models to ensure that Spanish and/or Basque are learnt in those \nschools which adopt CLIL: \n1. Model A: All subjects, apart from the Basque language and literature \nand modern languages, are taught in Spanish. \n2. Model B: Both Spanish and Basque are used to teach all subjects. \n3. Model C: All subjects, except Spanish language and literature and modern \nlanguages, are taught in Basque. \nThe models outlined by Ruiz de Zarobe (2008, p. 63; also Lasagabaster & \nRuiz de Zarobe, 2010) could be compared to three models proposed in Poland \nDarío Luis Banegas \n120 \nwhich may be instantiations of the interdisciplinary and language-based project \nmodels. According to Buczywek (2009, pp. 45-47), schools can choose from: \n1. A monodisciplinary model: Teachers work together to choose a topic \nto be addressed by the foreign language teacher in her class. Even \nthough all teachers cooperate, the language teacher explicitly inte-\ngrates foreign language and subject-matter.  \n2. A multidisciplinary model: Teachers choose a topic which will be ad-\ndressed by each subject teacher including the foreign language teach-\ner. Although this model provides a broader view of the content cho-\nsen, it requires good team teaching work. \n3. An interdisciplinary model: It requires more planning as it is thought as a \nset of lessons started by one subject which introduces the chosen topic. \nAs lessons progress, each teacher builds up on what learners already \nknow to provide them with a holistic understanding of the topic in focus.  \nConversely, Vázquez (2007, pp. 99-100) seems to blur the boundaries \nbetween bilingual education and CLIL and outlines five different bilingual/CLIL \nmodels currently found in German secondary schools. First, the classic model \nor full CLIL is a continuing bilingual programme through subjects such as Histo-\nr y a n d G e o g r a p h y w h i c h a r e t a u g h t i n E n g l i s h . I t s a i m i s r e l a t e d t o t h e j o b \nmarket and bilingualism through an emphasis on subject-matter instruction. \nThis model may be compared to its counterpart in the Netherlands where a \nmaximum of 50% of the total number of lessons may be taught in English or \nany other target language (Roza, 2009, p. 130). The short-term CLIL model, on \nthe other hand, is carried out during a specific period of time through certain \nsubjects. Thirdly, the bilingual models and the bilingual projects models can be \nplaced close to the language end of the continuum since language classes \nadopt theme-based units of work in which subjects and topics vary and, in \nfact, attempt to integrate more than two curriculum areas. Last, and perhaps \nthe most innovative in terms of how languages are used, the foreign language \nintegrated model seeks to integrate L1 and L2 through nonlanguage classes \nwhich are taught in German but whose preferably authentic texts and materi-\nals are in the foreign language.  \nOne more explicit model which falls under the first model found in Ger-\nmany is the three-directional model proposed by Ramos (2009, pp. 174-179). \nThis model is closely linked to the German classic model as it is addressed to \nteachers who teach their nonlanguage subjects in English. Therefore it is cur-\nriculum-driven and text-based, which could be associated with bilingual educa-\ntion or interdisciplinary models (Coyle, Hood, & Marsh, 2010). The model sug-\ngests three directions: horizontality, verticality, and diagonality. The first direc-\ntion is concerned with how the lesson is structured. Verticality, the second di-\nIntegrating content and language in English language teaching in secondary education: Models . . . \n121 \nrection, is realised by the task of including in each stage the vocabulary, gram-\nmatical patterns and learning strategies the teacher has set as objectives. In \nother words, the model emphasises the importance of cohesion as each aspect \nof the lesson is recaptured and revitalised in a dynamic process. The last direc-\ntion Ramos’ model proposes is that of diagonality. This direction is intimately \nlinked with the teaching discourse of explicitly telling learners what goals have \nbeen achieved at the end of each stage and the goals to be pursued in the com-\ning stage. In conclusion, this model may be similar to any other model or ap-\nproach within the communicative language teaching realm.  \nWhile CLIL in the Basque Country and Germany appears to be closely at-\ntached to the school curriculum, Poland offers, on the other hand, models \nwhich aim at a more complex integration through projects. While the first two \ncountries mentioned offer a more systematic and organised approach which \nfavours the instruction of content through a foreign language, Poland, in con-\ntrast, presents a less structured approach which is more concerned with lan-\nguage, thus subtly implying that content is an excuse for collaboration and \nprojects across the school curriculum. Whatever the model, they are all based \non a sociocultural perspective as the view that content will motivate learners \nto learn another language is paramount.  \nHowever, this whole array of models which seem to stress the percep-\ntion that CLIL is a suit for all seasons (Costa & D’Angelo, 2011) may also be a \nshortcoming for CBI-CLIL education. It may give the impression that anything \nthat deals with a certain type of content may be called CLIL (Marsh, 2008, p. \n244). This perception may be clarified if we agree that the content involved \nshould match the students’ L1 curriculum rather than a random selection of \ntopics which may bear distant or false connections with curricular content in a \ngiven educational system. \n \nCBI-CLIL Research in Programme Evaluation \n \nCBI-CLIL multiple models have given rise to a growing interest which can \nbe found across countries. According to the Eurydice Report (2006, p. 20), \nmost countries offer CLIL in secondary education. This report shows that be-\ntween the years 2004 and 2005, most countries offered CLIL in mainstream \nsecondary and, in second place, primary education as a result of imposed edu-\ncational policies. Dalton-Puffer and Nikula (2006) observe that CLIL has be-\ncome a common practice in many European countries as primarily reported by \npractitioners describing or researching their own classroom experiences in an \nexperimental quantitative paradigm in countries such as Austria (Dalton-Puffer, \n2007; Dalton-Puffer, Hüttner, Schindelegger, & Smit, 2009; Gierlinger, 2007), \nDarío Luis Banegas \n122 \nFinland (Haataja, 2007b; Nikula, 2007; Seikkula-Leino, 2007), Italy (Favilla, 2009; \nLucietto, 2008), Belgium (Chopey-Paquet & Amory-Bya, 2007), Hungary (Várkuti, \n2010), Poland (Loranc-Paszylk, 2009), Portugal (Costa & Godinho, 2007, p. 70), \nSpain (Halbach, 2009; Lasagabaster & Sierra, 2010; Lasagabaster & Ruiz de \nZarobe, 2010; Llinares & Whittaker, 2009; Lorenzo, Casal, & Moore, 2010; Mon-\nte & Roza, 2007) and Sweden (Airey, 2009) among others.  \nIn the year 2010, Lorenzo, Casal, and Moore (2010) published a large-\nscale evaluative study from a curriculum perspective which took place between \n2007 and 2008. The authors were concerned with CLIL and its potential for posi-\ntive cognitive gains, especially to what extent CLIL learners could increase their \nlinguistic and competence levels compared to their mainstream peers, their use \nof L2, and th e effect s o f CL IL in th e wid er educ at io nal con text . Data w ere col-\nlected through questionnaires to given 2,300 participating learners and parents, \nrecorded structured interviews of coordinators, and tests administered to bilin-\ngual and control learners so as to assess language competences. Results showed \nthat the CLIL learners outperformed the control groups in all four language skills \nin the four foreign languages under consideration. According to the authors, this \nmay also be due to the motivational processes behind CLIL classes as compared \nto the mainstream. As regards how input was made comprehensible, teacher \nquestionnaires showed that while content teachers tended to use the L2 for \ncontent, language teachers would use it for feedback and evaluation. However, \nboth types o f t eachers co inc ided in th e u se o f th e L 1 when d ealin g w ith prob -\nlems or for the telling of anecdotes.  \nNonetheless, the study was criticised by Bruton (2011a, p. 240), who ac-\ncused the authors of wanting “to demonstrate that CLIL is necessarily a positive \nroute” to raise foreign language learning curriculum standards. According to \nBruton (2011a), the study failed to provide valid results between CLIL and non-\nCL I L g ro u p s a s p r et e st s, e xt ra CL I L su p p o r t an d d i f f er en c e s in st at u s w e r e n o t \ndisinterestedly addressed.

Based on Mehisto and Asser (2007), Mehisto (2008, pp. 99-100) notes that \none of the issues to address is the lack of knowledge stakeholders have as re-\ngards aims. In order for administrators to implement CLIL programmes and mul-\ntiple models, there must be serious needs analysis (Butler, 2005, pp. 233-236; \nRuiz-Garrido & Fortanet-Gómez, 2009) to be carried out before all actions actu-\nally begin. In my view, all models need to be inductively implemented as it may \nbe the best way to ensure that implementations are the product of contextual \nconditions. Context-responsive CLIL pedagogies entail that stakeholders are \naware of the conditions offered and required in each educational setting.  \nLack of awareness or knowledge among administrators can also be found \namong those who are in charge of implementing CLIL: teachers. Teachers some-\ntimes do not know what is expected from them especially when CLIL means \nputting content and language teachers working together. In effect, teachers \nneed to come to terms with the models outlined above but only as a framework \nf ro m w h ic h t h e y c a n d e v elo p t h ei r o w n i n it ia t i v es d ep en d in g o n t h ei r le ve l o f \ninstitutional autonomy. For instance, Mehisto (2008) found out that those CLIL \nclasses whic h were on ly tau gh t by co nt ent t eac hers featu red second lan gu age \nsupp ort mostly th rou gh unn ecessary t ran slat ion. T his also led t o th e disco very \nthat teachers saw themselves as either content or language teachers, a view \nwhich affected team teaching or a full integration of components. This reticence \nwas found even in teachers’ unwillingness to incorporate materials coming from \ncontent or language classes. Overall, the author suggests that team teaching is \none of the major drawbacks in CLIL (see also Cammarata, 2009, pp. 569-574; \nCoonan, 2007; Coyle, 2007b; Coyle, Hood, & Marsh, 2010, p. 44; Feryok, 2008; \nMehisto, Marsh, & Frigols, 2008; Yassin, Tek, Alimon, Baharom, & Ying, 2010). \nWh at I p u t fo rw ar d is t h a t in t h o s e s it u at io n s w h e r e t e am t eac h in g i s s t i ll e x -\npected, this may occur between EFL teachers by strengthening collaborative \nplanning and materials development within the EFL teaching staff. \nMore teacher-related concerns are reported in Pena Díaz & Porto \nRequejo (2008) as part of a research project following the implementation of \nbilingual-CLIL programmes in 150 primary schools in Madrid. In order to un-\nderstand the factors which impinge on CLIL teachers’ practices in this setting, \nan unspecified number of teachers were interviewed following structured \nquestionnaires. Results showed that teachers believed their practices could be \nenhanced should they develop a more proficient command of English, a con-\nDarío Luis Banegas \n124 \ncern also reported in Pavón Vázquez and Rubio (2010, p. 51) and in Butler’s \n(2005, p. 236) study, which adds that teachers’ lack of content and language \nknowledge affects CLIL success. In other words, teachers may equate CLIL suc-\ncess with their own level of English and curricular content understanding. Sur-\nprisingly, given the fact that the participants in Pena Díaz and Porto Requejo \n(2008) lacked formal training on bilingual education methodologies, they con-\nsidered they did not need that type of theoretical training. They expressed \ntheir reliance on working with content teachers and the practical knowledge, \nnot defined in the article, of their subjects. Put simply, another concern which \nis recurrent across contexts is how to organise pre-service and in-service \nteacher education programmes which could also contemplate CLIL settings as \npossible sources of employment for future teachers.  \nMehisto’s (2008) article also includes a review of interviews with teach-\ners who were asked about what factors helped achieve CLIL programme suc-\ncess. Among the factors mentioned, training opportunities, support by immer-\nsion centres, and teaching materials were ranked in that order as regards their \ncentral importance in CLIL programmes. Addressing such factors is paramount \nfor quality assurance in CLIL (Coyle, 2007). However, when school managers \nwere interviewed, they admitted that these factors were rarely met. Such in-\naction caused distress as well as further resistance to innovation among \nteachers. This fact should remind us of what happens when implementations \noccur from the centre to the periphery where the implementers, that is, the \nteachers, are not fully equipped by adopters and suppliers (Waters, 2009, p. \n437). Nor is there development of CLIL teacher training programmes, content \nmaterials or instructional resources (Ruiz de Zarobe, 2008, p. 62; Lyster & Ball-\nin ger, 2 0 1 1 , p . 2 8 6 ). Ho w ever, in G erm an y, u n ivers it ies h ave st art ed t o o ffe r \nan additional CLIL teaching qualification, a trend which could be imitated by \nother countries (Vázquez, 2007, pp. 102-103).  \nNonetheless, I sense that most of the concerns outlined above stem \nf r o m t h e f a c t t h a t i t m a y n o t b e c l e a r w h a t C B I - C L I L m o d e l s e n t a i l a n d h o w \nthey differ from task-based learning, a topic-based syllabus, or international \ncoursebooks which usually feature reading topics or sections about general \nknowledge or culture. As I have suggested above, it is my view that the broad \nscope of CBI-CLIL models may act to the detriment of the models themselves \nas teachers may come to the conclusion that as long as there is ‘some content’ \ninvolved, they can call whatever they do CBI or CLIL within a language-driven \nperspective. Thus, it may be necessary for CBI-CLIL proponents to redefine \nwhat contents are expected to be used. In my own opinion, I suggest that the \ncontent component of CBI-CLIL should be closely connected to the school cur-\nriculum whatever the model.  \nIntegrating content and language in English language teaching in secondary education: Models . . . \n125 \nWith reference to materials, Ballman (1997, p. 183-184) claims that pub-\nlishers need to produce coursebooks which are related to learners’ lives in \ntheir contexts. Nonetheless, this suggestion is incompatible with CBI-CLIL spirit \nas contents should match the context and curriculum of implementation and, \ntherefore, I suspect that publishers, especially in this era of the global \ncoursebook, may not be interested to localise their international coursebooks \nto match the national curricula in every setting. This would call for an extreme \ndiversification which implies huge investment and little profits. It has also \nbeen suggested that teachers engaged in content-driven models may use \ntextbooks for native speakers to teach subjects such as History. The drawback \nof these materials is that they will not match other curricula than those of the \nnative student. It cannot be expected that a History book produced for British \nstudents could possibly respond to the Argentinian school curriculum, for ex-\nample. British History is studied by British students. Argentinian History is \nstudied by Argentinian students.  \nThis lack of CBI-CLIL materials implies greater workload for teachers \n(Alonso, Grisaleña, & Campo 2008, p. 46; Cammarata, 2009, p. 562; Coonan, \n2007, p. 628; Maley, 2011, p. 391; Moore & Lorenzo, 2007, pp. 28-35; Mehisto, \nMarsh, & Frigols, 2008, p. 22; Ricci Garotti, 2007, pp. 134-135; Vázquez, 2007, p. \n103). However, it is teachers in Argentina, Spain, or Poland who truly know what \ntheir school curricula contain and, therefore, they are in the best position to \ndevelop curriculum-responsive materials which could supplement other interna-\ntional materials. What I observe is that this challenge is, in fact, an opportunity \nfor teachers to become autonomous, less market-dependent, and developers of \nt h e i r o w n C B I - C L I L m a t e r i a l s . I s u g g e s t t h a t t e a c h e r s m a y p r o d u c e t h e i r o w n \nmaterials in collaboration even with their students to ensure that topics, \nsources, and activities are relevant and motivating in both students (Huang, \n2011) and teachers’ eyes and in response to the L1 curriculum.  \nAnother cause of disjuncture among teachers is the issue of examina-\ntions (Serragiotto, 2007). While CLIL, in theory, looks at language and content \nholistically, national exams are solely focused on content, creating a fracture \ni n t h e s y s t e m . I n o t h e r w o r d s , w h i l e t h e e d u c a t i o n a l p r o c e s s h a s o n e s e t o f \naims, examinations are guided by a different agenda, as it were. With refer-\nence to this concern, to my knowledge, there are no research studies which \ninvestigate complete teaching and learning processes so as to see what princi-\nples and decisions are to be found in classrooms. The point I am advancing \nhere is that there is a timely need to investigate classroom practices which \nevidence what teachers do from introducing new content and language topics \nuntil assessment is carried out and what materials scaffold these processes.  \nDarío Luis Banegas \n126 \nLack of knowledge of what CBI-CLIL entails can also be found among stu-\nd e n t s . F o r e x a m p l e , M eh i s t o (2 0 0 8 ) o b s e r v e d t h a t o u t o f 3 7 c l a s s e s o n l y a f e w \nfeatured what the aims, outcomes and themes were, thus affecting learners’ \nachievement as they did not know what was really expected from them and how \nthis programme actually differed from a more traditional approach. However, this \nside of CLIL has not been further explored. In fact, International CLIL Research \nJournal has several examples of reports and quasi-experiments in which learners \nvoice their happiness but seldom their less happy experiences. Another negative \naspect or, as Vázquez (2007, p. 106) puts it, less positive point, is parents’ re-\nsistance to accept English as the first language. Given its dominance in the CLIL \nscene, this feeling may be provoked by the tendency to explore CLIL through Eng-\nlish only (Dalton-Puffer, 2007, p. 1), which in turn reveals that all the so-called \nplurilingual initiatives have been nothing but plans and intentions.  \nF r o m a r e s e a r c h p e r s p e c t i v e , t h e l a c k o f r i g o r m a y a f f e c t h o w C L I L i s \noverall evaluated. Because of the design of some research, CLIL education may \nbe perceived as elitist since, sometimes, the best learners from mainstream \nclasses are placed in CLIL classes. This, needless to say, may skew possible re-\nsearch results, for learners have achieved good levels of performance both \ncontent and language-wise before starting CLIL. This fact also reveals a need to \nstudy classrooms in which learners have not been placed according to their \nforeign language performance or overall academic grades. \nAs Mehisto (2008) rightly claims above, stakeholders, especially school \nmanagers, must exercise a prominent role when CLIL is adopted as a result of \na top-down process. In that case, one of the challenges which school manag-\ners are not ready to explore is faculty development which assists both subject \nand language teachers so that they collaboratively teach subject-matter they \nhave not been initially trained for. If this is not achieved, content teachers, \nwho usually lack linguistic expertise (Vázquez, 2007, p. 106), may tend to \nstress content and neglect both language learning and the language teacher \n(Kong, 2009, p. 236; Creese, 2005, p. 194). In these situations, a CLIL coordina-\ntor can act as a liaison among learners, parents and content and language \nteachers (Pavón Vázquez & Rubio, 2010, p. 54). I believe that a CBI-CLIL coor-\ndinator may be in charge of ensuring the proper balance in content and lan-\nguage supported by methodologies and materials which help construct this \nintegration, especially when teachers may find it difficult to team teach.  \n \nConclusion \n \nApproaches which promote the integration of curricular content and \nforeign/second language learning offer a sound theoretical background com-\nIntegrating content and language in English language teaching in secondary education: Models . . . \n127 \ning from varied disciplines and academic spheres. In addition, CBI-CLIL offers \nmodels, curricular variations and a continuum which highlights the fact that \ninstitutions may opt for content-driven as well as language-driven implemen-\ntations. However, we should stress that several of the implementations and \ninnovative explorations within CBI-CLIL tend to be imposed on teachers as part \nof large-scale educational policies. Reports, in addition, solely focus on the \nbenefits of these approaches thus creating a rather incomplete picture of how \nthese realisations operate in practice without deeply voicing all stakeholders’ \nviews. This calls for an agenda which truly integrates policy and curriculum \nperspectives as well as top-down and bottom-up explorations. \nThese aspects appear to point towards the need for contextualised prac-\ntices. Although CBI and CLIL were originally the result of context-responsive \nanswers to emerging situations in Canada, the USA or Europe, other countries \nhave started to embrace CBI-CLIL as an innovative approach in their quest for \na revitalisation of the communicative approach. What is needed then is the \ncreation of spaces in which CBI-CLIL is examined within a particular context of \nculture where teachers play a significant role as they are crucial in any educa-\ntional change. CBI-CLIL offers new avenues for exploration, but these avenues \nhave to be based on thorough needs analysis in which all stakeholders are \ninvolved and in strict response to students’ L1 curriculum. \n \nDarío Luis Banegas \n128 \nReferences \n \nAirey, J.
