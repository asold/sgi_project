  "full_text": "RESEARCH Open Access\nElectronic data collection, management\nand analysis tools used for outbreak\nresponse in low- and middle-income\ncountries: a systematic review and\nstakeholder survey\nPatrick Keating 1,2*, Jillian Murray 1, Karl Schenkel 3, Laura Merson 4 and Anna Seale 1,2\nAbstract\nBackground: Use of electronic data collection, management and analysis tools to support outbreak response is\nlimited, especially in low income countries. This can hamper timely decision-making during outbreak response.\nIdentifying available tools and assessing their functions in the context of outbreak response would support\nappropriate selection and use, and likely more timely data-driven decision-making during outbreaks.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and a stakeholder survey of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response\nNetwork and other partners to identify and describe the use of, and technical characteristics of, electronic data\ntools used for outbreak response in low- and middle-income countries. Databases included were MEDLINE, EMBASE,\nGlobal Health, Web of Science and CINAHL with publications related to tools for outbreak response included from\nJanuary 2010 – May 2020. Software tool websites of identified tools were also reviewed. Inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria were applied and counts, and proportions of data obtained from the review or stakeholder survey were\ncalculated.\nResults: We identified 75 electronic tools including for data collection (33/75), management (13/75) and analysis\n(49/75) based on data from the review and survey. Twenty-eight tools integrated all three functionalities upon\ncollection of additional information from the tool developer websites. The majority were open source, capable of\noffline data collection and data visualisation. EpiInfo, KoBoCollect and Open Data Kit had the broadest use,\nincluding for health promotion, infection prevention and control, and surveillance data capture. Survey participants\nhighlighted harmonisation of data tools as a key challenge in outbreaks and the need for preparedness through\ntraining front-line responders on data tools. In partnership with the Global Health Network, we created an online\ninteractive decision-making tool using data derived from the survey and review.\n© The Author(s). 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1741 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11790-w\nConclusions: Many electronic tools are available for data -collection, −management and -analysis in outbreak\nresponse, but appropriate tool selection depends on knowledge of tools ’ functionalities and capabilities. The online\ndecision-making tool created to assist selection of the most appropriate tool(s) for outbreak response helps by\nmatching requirements with functionality. Applying the tool together with harmonisation of data formats, and\ntraining of front-line responders outside of epidemic periods can support more timely data-driven decision making\nin outbreaks.\nKeywords: Data collection, Data analysis, Data management, Outbreaks, Low income, Middle income\nIntroduction\nInfectious disease outbreaks pose a serious global health\nchallenge, as illustrated by the worldwide pandemic of\nCOVID-19. In the last decade alone, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) has declared six Public Health\nEmergency of International Concern (PHEIC) associated\nwith infectious diseases [ 1– 3]. Low and middle-income\ncountries (LMICs) with weaker health systems are par-\nticularly at risk with limited surveillance leading to late\ndetection and response to outbreaks [ 4, 5]. During out-\nbreaks, timely collection, management, sharing, analysis\nand reporting of data are required to ensure that inter-\nventions are appropriately targeted and effective in sup-\nporting outbreak control.\nThe use of information and communication technolo-\ngies (ICT) for health - eHealth, is growing in importance\nas it facilitates access to and delivery of health services as\nwell as collection, management and analysis of infectious\nand non-communicable disease data [ 6, 7]. Electronic\ntools and solutions offer many advantages over traditional\npaper-based data collection, including more rapid data\ncollection and transfer, use of checks/validation to im-\nprove data accuracy, and collection of more diverse data\ntypes including images, audio and barcodes. They can pro-\nvide cost savings and are more environmentally friendly\n[8– 11]. However, electronic tools also have limitations in\nsome contexts, for example if there are requirements for\nstable electricity, internet or phone connectivity.\nElectronic tools can also be used during outbreaks to sup-\nport timely collection and analysis of data. However, in prac-\ntice, in outbreak response we have observed data are often\ncollected on paper and day-to-day programs for analysis be-\ning used, foregoing tools better designed to meet needs.\nT h e r ea r eag r o w i n gn u m b e ro ft o o l sa v a i l a b l ef o ru s ei no u t -\nbreaks and emergencies [ 12, 13]. A recent review identified\n58 mobile tools developed for, or used during, the Ebola out-\nbreak in West Africa in 2013 – 2016 [12]. There are however\nchallenges to the use of electronic tools in outbreaks and\nemergencies. Emergencies require rapid deployment of front-\nline workers for data collection, and while there are now\nmany electronic tools to support this, various similar tools\nfor data collection may occur during the same outbreak at\nthe same time in a fragmented manner, due to lack of coord-\nination. The number of similar tools combined with the\ncompressed timeframes can lead to little time for deliber-\nation over optimal data collection methods. There are also\nrequirements in these contexts - emergencies and outbreaks\nin LMICs often occur in settings with the most limited infra-\nstructures and tools in these settings need to be flexible to\nfunction in these environments. They also need to be able to\nbe incorporated into existing data or surveillance infrastruc-\ntures and allow for interopera bility and/or data sharing be-\ntween organisations. Ideally, these electronic tools should be\nemployed both for routine surveillance activities and out-\nbreak response in an integrated, sustainable approach.\nChoosing the most appropriate electronic tool for an\noutbreak response is important, but it is also essential to\nharmonise data collection and ensure interoperability.\nSome projects seek to support harmonisation of how we\ncollect data independently of the tool we use, including\nthe Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL) and the\nWHO “Outbreak Toolkit ” [14, 15]. Standardising the\nchoice, format and/or naming/tagging of the data vari-\nables collected between and within organisations during\noutbreaks and humanitarian emergencies (such as\nthrough standardised case investigation forms, unique\nagreed reporting categories, standardised data formats\nand data dictionaries) facilitates more efficient data shar-\ning and timelier data analyses for rapid decision making.\nIn outbreaks and emergencies, diverse technical char-\nacteristics are required for an electronic data system to\nsupport the most effective outbreak response. With lim-\nited time and resources, it is unsurprising that decision\nmakers may have difficulty identifying the most appro-\npriate tools for their needs. Here we aim to identify and\ndescribe characteristics of electronic data collection,\nmanagement and analysis tools used for infectious dis-\nease outbreaks in LMICs, the functionalities most com-\nmonly required in outbreaks, in order to facilitate\ndecision making on appropriate tool selection. We also\naimed to make this information more easily accessible to\nrelevant stakeholders through the creation of an inter-\nactive and dynamic online decision-making tool.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nWe followed PRISMA guidelines to conduct the system-\natic review [ 16]. We searched five electronic databases:\nKeating et al. BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1741 Page 2 of 13\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science\nand CINAHL. The search terms included four categor-\nies: LMICs, outbreaks or epidemics or early warning\nalert and response or humanitarian emergencies, data\nmanagement, collection and analysis and electronic\ntools. Search terms are listed in additional file 1 for all\ndatabases. The search strategies included indexed terms\nwhere possible. LMIC filters based on World Bank cate-\ngorizations were used from Ovid [ 17].\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nWe included studies if they described electronic data\ncollection, management or analysis tools that were used\nin low- and middle-income countries either for detection\nor response to an infectious disease outbreak (animal or\nhuman) alone or as part of a humanitarian emergency,\nor as part of an early warning and alert system. In\naddition, studies that analysed outbreak data or per-\nformed operational disease modelling analyses were in-\ncluded. Studies published from 1st January 2010 to 12th\nOctober 2018 in English, French, German, Portuguese\nor Spanish were included. An update of the original\nsearch was conducted which included studies published\nfrom October 2018 to May 2020.\nWe excluded studies that described non-communicable\ndiseases or drug epidemics, clinical trials in outbreaks;\nseroprevalence studies; qualitative studies, unless directly\nlinked to data tools for collection, management and ana-\nlysis of outbreak or outbreak-related humanitarian data.\nStudies that focused on retrospective analysis of infectious\ndisease surveillance data to identify outbreaks as well as\narticles describing electronic data tools without any oper-\national application to outbreak response were also ex-\ncluded. Similarly, modelling analyses based on surveillance\nor simulated data as well as tools for humanitarian re-\nsponse or preparedness without any link to outbreak re-\nsponse were excluded. Hospital information management\ntools, unless specifically developed for an outbreak, were\nalso excluded. Review articles and studies for which full\ntext articles were not available open access were also\nexcluded.\nIdentification of potentially eligible studies\nWe exported identified studies to Endnote (version 8,\nClarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, USA) and removed any\nduplicates. Two authors (PK and JM) independently\nassessed the relevance of all titles and abstracts based on\ninclusion and exclusion criteria. In the case of differing\nviews on the inclusion of an article, consensus was\nreached by discussion between the two researchers. Full-\ntext articles were retrieved for all potentially relevant\nstudies. Two authors (PK and JM) independently\nassessed the full text articles using the inclusion and ex-\nclusion criteria.\nData extraction\nWe extracted information, using a standardised form, on\nthe electronic tools from the included articles examining\ncost, license type, compatibility with windows, mac and\nlinux, location of data storage, ability to visualise data,\nwhether data could be collected with a mobile applica-\ntion (also the type of mobile devices that could be used\nfor data collection) or via a web interface, data encryp-\ntion functionality, collection of GPS data, and ability to\ncollect data offline (see additional file 2 for the defini-\ntions used for the data extraction). We supplemented\ndata from the systematic review with additional detail on\ntechnical capacities and overall functions either via dir-\nect contact with the electronic tool developers and/or\nreading information provided in their websites.\nStakeholder survey\nTo identify electronic tools used in recent outbreaks in\nLMICs, we invited key stakeholders, such as Global Out-\nbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) members\nwhich includes National Public Health Institutes, Minis-\ntries of Health, United Nations Agencies, National and\ninternational laboratory teams, non-governmental orga-\nnisations (e.g. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans\nFrontières), Training Programs in Epidemiology and\nPublic Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET) and\nrelated Field Epidemiology Training Programmes to par-\nticipate in an online survey (created using Enketo and\navailable in English and French) in May 2019 (see add-\nitional file 3 for the data dictionary of the survey). To be\neligible to complete the survey, participants needed to\nhave responded to outbreaks in World Health Organisa-\ntion (WHO) grade two or three priority countries that\nincluded Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Central\nAfrican Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo,\nEthiopia, Iran, Iraq, Mali, Nigeria, Occupied Palestinian\nTerritory, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syrian\nArab Republic, Turkey/North Syria, Ukraine and Yemen.\nWe selected these countries to identify tools that had\nbeen used in recent outbreaks during acute or pro-\ntracted emergencies. We asked participants to identify\nthe electronic data collection, management and analysis\ntools used during the outbreaks and to specify what they\nused the tools for. We focused on key pillars of outbreak\nresponse and asked participants to specify which elec-\ntronic tools they used to collect/manage and analyse\nalert, case investigation, contact tracing, health promo-\ntion, case management, infection, prevention and con-\ntrol, laboratory, surveillance, clinical trial and water and\nsanitation data. We also asked participants their reasons\nfor selecting the specific tool, and for any suggestions on\nhow to improve the tools. In addition, participants were\nasked to rank and comment on data collection chal-\nlenges in outbreaks.\nKeating et al. BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1741 Page 3 of 13\nData analysis\nCounts and proportions of data obtained either from the\nsystematic review or the stakeholder survey were calcu-\nlated using R version 3.6.1, R Foundation for Statistical\nLearning, Vienna, Austria. Text data from the stake-\nholder survey were analysed by reviewing responses and\nidentifying the most frequently shared views.\nResults\nIdentification of electronic tools - systematic review and\nstakeholder survey\nWe identified 5773 studies from the five selected data-\nbases across the period 2010 – 2020 and after deduplica-\ntion, 4503 potentially relevant studies remained. We\nscreened full-text articles for 321 studies, of which 80\nwere included [ 11, 18– 96] (see additional file 4 for a list\nof excluded studies and the reasons for exclusion). From\n80 studies included, we identified 64 unique electronic\ndata tools (Fig. 1). Of these 80 studies, twelve, eleven,\nfive and three studies were focused on Ebola, Dengue,\nCholera and COVID-19, respectively. Four and six stud-\nies described animal outbreaks and early warning sys-\ntems, respectively. Six custom-made applications were\nalso among the included studies. Among the 64 tools re-\nported, 12 were identified through the update to the sys-\ntematic review from 2018 to 2020. No major differences\nwere observed in terms of the types of tools (i.e. similar\nproportions of data collection, management and analysis\ntools were found in both periods) identified in the pe-\nriods 2010 – 2018 and 2018 and 2020.\nFifty-five individuals consented to complete the online\nstakeholder survey, of which 41 were eligible for inclusion.\nFour Ministries of Health and sixteen organisations were\nrepresented, of which Doctors Without Borders and the\nWHO made up 22% ( n = 9) each of the eligible survey re-\nspondents (see additional file 5 for a summary of all orga-\nnisations that participated). The Democratic Republic of\nCongo ( n =2 0 ) , N i g e r i a (n = 11) and Bangladesh ( n =1 0 )\nwere the countries most frequently mentioned for out-\nbreak response by respondents. However, respondents\nhad been involved in outbreak response in 17 out of the\n20 listed countries. Epidemiologists represented the ma-\njority of survey respondents (59%, n = 24). Respondents\nreported working at international, national, regional and\nfield levels, with the majority (51%, n = 21) working at\nfield level. Twenty-nine unique tools were reported in the\nstakeholder survey and after deduplication with the tools\nidentified from the systematic review, 75 tools were in-\ncluded in this study for further characterisation (Fig. 1).\nUses of electronic data tools\nThe 75 identified tools reported in the systematic review\nand survey covered data collection [ 33], management\n[13] and analysis [ 49] activities as detailed in Table 1.O f\nnote, many of the tools could be used for collection and/\nor management and/or analysis and almost half of the\nanalysis tools related to analysis/visualisation of sequen-\ncing data. In the following paragraphs the proportion of\ndata collection, management and analysis tools in terms\nof their uses and other characteristics is calculated, but\nthese calculations exclude tools for which it was not pos-\nsible to ascertain if the tool had the specific use/charac-\nteristic or not. For data collection tools, surveillance was\nthe most frequently reported use (81%, n = 25), followed\nby case management and health promotion (69% and\n54%, respectively). Electronic data collection tools were\nless frequently reported as being used for collection of\ninfection, prevention and control data (25%, n = 6) and\nfor WASH assessments (30%, n = 7). For data manage-\nment, the majority of the thirteen reported data manage-\nment tools allowed data cleaning, survey generation and\nmore general data management functionality. For data\nanalysis, of the 49 identified data analysis tools, data\nvisualisation (72%, n = 21) and mapping (69%, n = 18)\nwere the most commonly reported uses and phylogen-\netic analysis the least (43%, n = 13).\nThe reported uses of electronic data collection, man-\nagement and analysis tools in outbreak response identi-\nfied in the systematic review and stakeholder survey are\ngiven in Fig. 2a, b and c for each tool respectively. Epi\nInfo, KoBoCollect and ODK were the tools most widely\nreported in use to collect a range of outbreak data,\nfollowed closely by DHIS2 and EWARS (Fig. 2a). There\nwere fewer differences across reported data management\ntools and MS Access, Excel, EWARS and Epi Data of-\nfered the same number of functionalities (Fig. 2b).\nAmong data analysis tools, ArcGIS, R, SAS and Stata\nwere reported as being used with the greatest diversity\nof functions (Fig. 2c). See additional file 6 for a summary\nof the tools that organisations with at least two respon-\ndents reported. The number of uses identified per tool\nvaried depending on whether the tool was reported in\nthe survey and/or the systematic review, such that tools\nreported in the systematic review only generally had\nfewer reported uses (see additional file 7 for a break-\ndown of where tools were identified from, the period of\nthe systematic review and their reported uses).\nCharacteristics of electronic data tools\nWith further investigation via contacting tool developers\nor through the tool websites, we found that many of the\ntools identified in the review and stakeholder had more\nfunctionalities and uses compared to data obtained from\nthe survey and review alone. Twenty-eight out of the 75\nidentified tools could perform data collection, manage-\nment and analysis functions to a greater or lesser extent\nin comparison to seven tools based on data only avail-\nable in the review and survey. The 28 tools that\nKeating et al.

In addition, we\nfound the majority of tools were compatible with Win-\ndows (100%) and Apple (85%). However, only 63% ( n =\n15) are open source software and 87% ( n = 20) of the\nsoftware are free (see additional file 8 for more detailed\ninformation per tool).\nFactors influencing tool selection\nSurvey participants were asked an open question on\nwhat influenced their choice of tool, and 10 factors\nemerged as key influencers: [ 1] cost [ 2]; user friendliness\n[3]; speed to configure data collection forms/deploy the\nFig. 1 PRISMA flow chart for systematic literature review (2010 – 2020) [ 16]\nKeating et al.

Ten improvements were rec-\nommended: [ 1] reduce the cost [ 2]; improve the inter-\noperability [ 3]; improve user-friendliness [ 4]; increase\nthe flexibility and customisability of the tool, which\nwould reduce the reliance of local staff on centralised\nteams/deployment of specialists [ 5]; provide more train-\ning resources and in more languages, with a suggestion\nto build training modules within the tools [ 6]; simplify\nthe local hosting procedures [ 7]; improve data visualisa-\ntions [ 8]; allow more advanced analyses to be performed\n[9]; improve multiple user management and [ 10] im-\nprove support for longitudinal data.\nData collection challenges in outbreaks\nSurvey respondents ’ were asked to rank nine potential\ndata collection challenges during outbreaks in LMICs,\nwhich were based on the experiences of the authors: [ 1]\nensuring data confidentiality [ 2]; harmonisation of data\ntools [ 3]; operating in insecure environments [ 4] lack of\nor limited internet access [ 5]; language barriers [ 6]; phys-\nical access to populations/areas [ 7]; lack of or limited\npower supply [ 8]; community resistance and [ 9] lack of\nor limited telecommunications/mobile connectivity.\nBased on the median ranking score, respondents rated\nharmonisation of data tools as the most difficult chal-\nlenge of those listed, but there was overlap with other\nchallenges including operating in insecure environments\nand lack of or limited internet access. Respondents were\nalso asked to comment on other data collection chal-\nlenges and provide any further reflections on electronic\ntools and highlighted the following: [ 1] integrated\nTable 1 Uses and number of electronic data collection tools as reported in the review or survey for outbreak response in LMICs\nPurpose of tool Use Yes (n) No (n) Unknown (n) % Yes a\nData collection ( n = 33) Surveillance 25 6 2 81\nCase management 18 8 7 69\nOther collection activities 13 8 12 62\nHealth promotion 13 11 9 54\nLaboratory 13 12 8 52\nCase investigation 13 13 7 50\nAlerts 11 13 9 46\nContact tracing 11 14 8 44\nWASH 7 16 10 30\nIPC 6 18 9 25\nData management (n = 13) Data management 10 0 3 100\nData cleaning 8 1 4 88\nSurvey generation 10 2 1 83\nOther data management activities 7 3 3 70\nData analysis ( n = 49) Data visualisation 21 8 20 72\nMapping 18 8 23 69\nDescriptive analysis 16 8 25 67\nData reporting 15 8 26 65\nData cleaning 11 8 30 58\nDashboard creation 12 9 28 57\nSpatial analysis 12 10 27 55\nOther data analysis activities 10 9 30 53\nModelling 11 10 28 52\nPhylogenetic analysis 13 17 19 43\naThe denominator is the sum of yes and no\nKeating et al.

BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1741 Page 7 of 13\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, as it allows timely decision\nmaking on response activities, whether localised or\nworldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic alone has led to\nthe development of a number of new tools for contact\ntracing and other purposes used across multiple settings,\nalthough primarily in high-income countries, but also\nraised concerns about data protection/security [ 97]. We\nidentified a wide range of electronic tools to support\ndata collection, management and analysis in outbreak re-\nsponse. Key requirements for tools selected at present\ninclude availability and whether training is needed, as\nwell as cost, and if the software is open source. This may\nlead to use of tools without the optimal functionalities\nfor outbreak response as most members of an outbreak\nresponse team, including non-analytical staff, are famil-\niar with standard software. Specifically designed and in-\ntegrated tools, can better support outbreak investigation\nacross data collection, management and analysis. With\nmore advanced analytics being incorporated into out-\nbreak response and with data management being an in-\ntegral part of data analysis, ease of use should not drive\nchoice [ 98]. Analytic tools used in an emergency should\nideally be part of routinely used surveillance software or\nat least be compatible with and complement such rou-\ntine surveillance software. In addition, analytic tools\nshould also reflect the analysis and data management\nrequired for outbreak control. Supporting decision\nmakers to consider and match the functionalities of a\ntool, with their requirements, is a key part of enabling\noptimal use of tools, as well as overcoming practical\nconstraints through preparedness, to support training\nand implementation.\nWe identified electronic tools in the published lit-\nerature as well as tools organisations recently used in\noutbreak response in LMICs. However, the diversity\nof information may be limited by the responses to the\nsurvey, which was sent out to GOARN members (200\ntechnical institutes and over 600 partners worldwide),\nwith only 20 organisations (four Ministries of Health\nfrom LMICs) completing the survey [ 99]. In addition,\nthe majority of respondents were epidemiologists\nfrom international organisations including MSF and\nthe WHO and thus the results may not fully reflect\nthe electronic tools being used across different pillars\nin outbreak response nor those used routinely in\nLMICs for outbreaks in which international organisa-\ntions do not get involved. The survey did, however,\nsupport identification of tools in the grey literature,\nwhich also formed a key part of the findings of a re-\ncent review on tools used in the Ebola outbreak [ 12].\nIn addition, the period covered by this study included\nt h ef i r s tm o n t h so ft h eC O V I D - 1 9p a n d e m i cb u tw e\nonly identified one novel tool developed to support\nCOVID-19 response [ 25]. This tool called the Honghu\nHybrid System incorporated clinical, laboratory and\nsocial media platform data to help COVID-19 surveil-\nlance and control. It is likely that the Honghu Hybrid\nSystem is one of many such tools that have been de-\nveloped since the start of the pandemic and a\nCOVID-19 specific review would enable the identifi-\ncation of further such innovations.\nDespite these limitations, we identified a wide range of\ntools, and showed that tools which are open source are\nimportant, as well as training to support their use. Out-\nbreak response personnel, especially front-line workers,\nmust be trained in the use of integrated tools that can\nperform key basic analyses to support rapid decision\nmaking. Training on such tools during non-emergency\nperiods is thus vital. Training initiatives such as the\nDHIS2 academy enable individuals to build capacity in\nthe implementation of DHIS2 at national and higher\nlevels outside periods of outbreaks/emergencies [ 100].\nSimilar training initiatives could be used to strengthen\ncapacity of front-line workers on other outbreak deploy-\nment tools and factors such as DHIS2-compatibility, be-\ning open source and having large and diverse\ncommunity user bases could help narrow the scope of\ntools for such initiatives. Moreover, it would enable the\nidentification of tools more likely to be maintained and\ndeveloped compared to the use of more niche tools. It\nwas surprising to find a small number of tools created\nfor specific projects such as the AVADAR, mHealthSur-\nvey, OlympTRIP and the Institut Pasteur applications\n[57, 59, 85, 101]. Through investment in existing open-\nsource tools, researchers and Ministries of Health could\nadd new functionalities to these tools benefitting larger\nuser communities and limiting the proliferation of elec-\ntronic tools with similar functionalities. In addition, in-\nclusion of regularly updated training modules (in\nmultiple languages) within the tools themselves could\noffer opportunities to strengthen capacity of front-line\nworkers during non-emergency periods.\nThe large number of tools for data collection, manage-\nment and analysis, with similar functionalities (and lim-\nited economic evaluation) makes it difficult for decision\nmakers to select the most appropriate tool for their\nneeds. This range of tools has both advantages and dis-\nadvantages, as no one tool may be suitable for all types\nof outbreaks across multiple different contexts. There-\nfore, decision makers would benefit from support to\nmatch the functionalities of tools with their specific re-\nquirements and contexts. To address this point, from\nthis study, we created an online decision-making tool\n(https://uk-phrst.tghn.org/to ols-platforms/tools/data-\ntool-finder-app/) based on data collected from this study\nto support organisations to identify the most appropriate\ntool(s) for their needs (based on data in additional file\n8). The online decision-making tool enables users to\nKeating et al. BMC Public Health         (2021) 21:1741 Page 8 of 13\nselect electronic tools based on their requirements, rate\ntools they have already used and to make suggestions of\nany extra tools to include in the decision-making tool.\nThis will allow it to both identify better performing tools\nand to remain up to date with electronic tools being\nused and developed for outbreak response in LMICs.\nUsers can take into consideration factors such as the\ncost, the license type, availability of a mobile application,\nability to perform data visualisation and location where\ndata are hosted.\nThe need for better data harmonisation and im-\nproved interoperability between tools was another key\nfinding of this study. Improving the interoperability\nand harmonisation between outbreak data collection\ntools and broader Health Information Systems facili-\ntating routine surveillance activities (such as DHIS2)\nis important. Harmonising use of data tools within\nand between organisations, supporting training and\nimproving interoperability remain key to improving\nuptake and use of electronic tools in outbreak re-\nsponse in LMICs. Harmonising electronic tool use\nacross regions would allow for the roll out of standar-\ndised training to regional and national rapid response\nteams and thus improve their ability to support each\nother during outbreaks. The current COVID-19 pan-\ndemic illustrates this further and that it is not just in\nLMICs where harmonisation of tools and training is\nrequired but it would be highly beneficial in all coun-\ntries. All pillars of the COVID-19 response rely on\ndata to inform interventions/actions taken from case\nmanagement, contact tracing, risk communication to\ninfection prevention and control and a harmonisation\nof data formats, tools and training would save coun-\ntries time and financial resources.\nImproving the consistency of the choice and format of\ndata collected in emergencies is recognised internation-\nally [ 14, 15]. Using the same data templates would\ngreatly facilitate management, analysis and sharing of\ndata and thus more rapid and better-informed decision\nmaking. Enabling more rapid sharing of data during a\npandemic such as COVID-19 within and between coun-\ntries would further support more rapid and appropriate\ndecision making. In addition, ensuring that data collec-\ntors know why they are collecting the data, how it will\nbe used and have access to the results are all important\nin maintaining motivation to work in challenging out-\nbreak environments.\nIn conclusion, a multi-faceted approach that considers\nboth the type and format of data being collected, the use\nof integrated electronic tools that ideally function both\nfor routine surveillance and outbreak response as well as\na focus on training and ongoing capacity strengthening\non data collection, management and analyses is needed\nto address this most urgent challenge.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12889-021-11790-w.\nAdditional file 1.
