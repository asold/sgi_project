With the aggressive ascent in smart-\nphones’ usage, people became more dependent on these technologies, which led them to store\nmore of their data on smart devices for convenient use [2, 17]. However, this aroused a threat to\nindividuals’ data as cyberattacks are getting more common these days [32].\nTheAndroidarchitectureandprivacypolicypermitapplicationstotakeinformationfrommul-\ntiple hardware embedded in smartphones, while iOS keeps a stricter term about allowing applica-\ntionstousesensors.ThisiOSpolicyonlyallowsafewthird-partyapplicationstoaccesshardware\nsensors [15]. However, such escalated features and permissions make smartphones vulnerable to\nside-channel attacks [12]. A side-channel cyberattack is executed by obtaining data from the ex-\necution of a system rather than vulnerability in the executable algorithm. The periodic flow of\ninformation,systempowerutilization,electromagneticdataleakage,andaudiowavescanprovide\nan additional cause of information exploitation [1, 3, 30]. Figure1 graphically represents some\ncommonattackscausedbytheside-channelattack.Theseattacksincludetimingattacksinwhich\nan attacker monitors the timing of different events regarding hardware, such as computations of\nexecution timing. Another major side-channel attack includes a cache-attack based on the moni-\ntoring of cache accesses done by the victim.\nDifferentialfaultanalysisisatypeofside-channelattackinwhichanomaliesarefoundbyintro-\nducingfaultsinthecomputation.Anothermajorside-channelattackisaPower-monitoringattack\nin which the attacker monitors the hardware power consumption frequency and other configura-\ntions. The electromagnetic attack is a type of side-channel attack in which a hacker can analyze\nelectromagneticradiationsfromhardwarethatcanretrieveactualplaintextandotherrelevantin-\nformation such as cryptographic keys. Similarly, Acoustic cryptanalysis is a type of side-channel\nattackthatexploitssensitiveinformationthroughsoundfrequency,amplitude,andotherattributes\nemitted from the computer hardware.\n1.1 Problem Statement\nSmartphones are the most valuable targets for hackers to perform cyberattacks. Hackers com-\nmonly observe to compromise an individual’s sensitive data through the smartphone screen’s\nkeystrokes. We demonstrate the feasibility of inferring smartphone keystrokes accurately from\nsmartphone sensor readings and predicting the individual’s personalized writing pattern.\nThisarticleisanextensionofourpreviouspaper[ 15].Thisarticlefocusesoninferringshortand\nlong sentences typed on the soft keyboard of a smartphone. We extend the previously collected\ndata by adding a space key to separate words in the sentences.

The selected window is different enough to acquire all the readings\nto input in the classification method. We assign the labels as the alphabets have been known as\na ground truth. This configuration enables the model to accurately address and record the sensor\nreadingsandalphabetsbeingused.Afeaturematrixisgeneratedbasedon130,000rawvaluesfrom\nsensors in which each reading is composed of a 3-axis of all three sensors.\n3.3 Dense Multilayer Neural Network (DMNN)\nThis research is based on predicting the given alphabets as labels using TTIV and then using\nthose alphabets labels to generate output sequences. We propose the methodology of S2LS. The\narchitecture used for the S2LS problem is based on making better decisions and can tune its re-\nspective weights more efficiently, and the S2L model can learn the input features more accurately.\nThis research solves the Text Inference classification problem by predicting the target labels\nand then use those predicted labels and pass them to the sequence generator module to generate\nthe output sequence. This type of method allows us to apply the DMNN for the text inference\nclassificationtask.Thisresearchaimstogeneratetheoutputsequenceusingatextinferencevector\nto predict the alphabet’s characters sequence.\n3.3.1 Input Layer. Input features length is equal to 9. Thus, there are 9 features to form one\nsequence that pass it as input. The number of neurons in the first (input) layer is 100 neurons.\n3.3.2 Hidden Layer.

Each hidden layer applies various functions on the input feature vectors.\n3.3.3 Activation Function. Activation functions are also known as squashing functions. These\nfunctionsarenormallyappliedtotheoutputresultfromthehiddenlayersofthemodel.However,\nevery hidden layer of the model is a linear transform accompanied by a squashing function non-\nlinearity. The activation function accepts one input reading and applies mathematical procedures\nover it. For the activation function, we applyRectified Linear Unit (RELU):\nд(x) = σ(WT\ni X +bias). (1)\nACM Trans. Asian Low-Resour. Lang. Inf. Process., Vol. 20, No. 5, Article 87. Publication date: June 2021.\nBetalogger: Smartphone Sensor-based Side-channel Attack Detection 87:7\n3.3.4 Rectified Linear Unit (RELU). RELU is an activation function that returns zero when the\nvalueislessthanzero (x <0),andthenlinearwithslope1whenvalueisgreaterthanzero (x >0).\nIts mathematical form is\nf(x) =max(0,x). (2)\nRELU output is thresholds at zero value like less than any value converted into zero. RELU is\nalwaysprioritizedduetotwomajorreasons.ThefirstreasonisRELUworksonlowcomputational\nrequirements than other activation functions, which include sigmoid and tanh functions, since\nit does not require complex computations such as exponential. The second reason is that it is\nhighly accelerating the intersection point, i.e.,Stochastic-Gradient-Decent (SGD)convergence\ncompared to tanh and sigmoid.\n3.3.5 Objective/Cost Function. The objective/cost function calculates the difference between\nthe true labelsy and the predicted labelsy′ of the classifier. It is a mechanism that is used for\nevaluating how effective the model is during the training. Cost function and error are directly\nproportional. The error in the system will be higher if the cost function returns a greater value.\nThismodelusesoftmaxasacostfunction.InLR,wehavebinarylabelsthatare:y ∈0,1.However,\nthesoftmaxfunctioncanworkwithmorethantwoclasseswhere y′∈1,...,k,where k isthetotal\ntarget classes:\nZ[l] =W[l]a[l] +bias[l], (3)\na[l] = ez[l]\nΣi=1ti . (4)\n3.3.6 Regularization. Regularization preventsNeural Network (NN)from over-fitting, and it\nactsuponwhenNNproperlyfitsthedatafortrainingbutunabletoexecuteonthedatafortesting.\nTo prevent over-fitting, L2-regularization is used as it penalizes the squared magnitude of all the\nNN parameters except bias-inputs and then embeds it in the objective function. L2-regularization\ngives more diffuse weights that are near to zero.λ (regularization controlling factor) is used to\npredict the quantity of penalization of weights:\nR(Wi ) = λ\n2m || W ||2 . (5)\n3.3.7 Weight Initialization. Weight initialization in NN contributes a significant part to the\nmodel training process and convergence conduct. It is a recommended procedure to utilize RELU\nunits. Equation (5) represents the initialization of the weights. This kind of weight initialization\nmaintainsthevarianceacrossallthelayersintheDMNN.WeusedaGaussiandistributionmethod\nto randomly initialize the weights with a standard deviation of\n√\n(2/m), where m represents the\ninputs:\nWi =random(m)∗\n√\n2.0\nm . (6)\n3.3.8 Optimization. Optimization methods act as a major driving force to minimizing the cost\nfunctions. Adam optimizer is a stochastic base method. It is the combination of momentum and\nRMSprop. This method is computationally efficient and has very fewer memory requirements.\nAdam’soptimizerconvergencerateascomparedtootheroptimizationalgorithmsissorapid.The\nvalues ofϵ = 10−8, β1 = 0.9,and β2 = 0.999.\nAt first, we give our generated TIV data to the DMNN model, which returns predicted labels in\nalphabetcharacters.DMNNcomprisestwoparts:(1)usingTIVasaninputfeatureandpredictthe\nACM Trans.

LRisastatisticalmodelthatusesalogisticfunction.Thelogistic\nmodel is used to model the probability of a certain target class or existing event. LR is used to\npredict the class category of individuals based on one or multiple predictor variables. LR does\nnot return the class of observations directly but depends on the estimated probability of class\nmembership. The probability will range between 0 and 1 as shown in Equation (7):\nℓ(y′,y) = − 1\nm\n[/summationdisplay.1\ni=1\n(yloд(y′)+(1−y)loд(1−y′)\n]\n, (7)\nwherey′ shows the predicted value, which should be small, y represents the actual target value.\nEquation (7) represents the cost function using a sigmoid function (σ) to predict the target label.\n3.4.2 Gradient Boosting (GB).

NB is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that is used for clas-\nsification problems. The crux of the NB is based on the Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem is used\nto calculate the probability of X happening, given that Y has occurred. Where X is the hypothe-\nsis, Y represents the evidence. The assumption is that the feature predictors are independent. The\ncalculation for Bayes Theorem can be calculated using the following Equation (17):\nP(X | Y) = P(Y | X)P(X)\nP(Y) .
