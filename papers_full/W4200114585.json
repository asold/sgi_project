    "abstract": "This work refers to the criterion values used to assess the state of the active part of the transformer based on the analysis of the effective value of the total vibration acceleration and the frequency spectrum. It was proved in the work that the criteria values should be differentiated for transformers of different rated power. Transformers with lower rated power are characterized by lower RMS values of vibration acceleration than units with higher rated power, which cannot remain without impact on the criteria values. Trend analysis of the total aRMS values may reveal increasing defects before the currently applicable criteria values are exceeded. In addition, the influence of the position of the sensor on the frequency spectrum of the obtained signals was analyzed. It was proved that the sensors should be mounted in the middle of the transformer tank, between its lower part and the cover. The dependence of RMS value of vibration acceleration on no-load losses was also determined for transformers of different types but the same rated power. This relationship will not have a large share in the total vibrations of the transformer, due to slight changes in the value of aRMS occurring for all analyzed units.",
