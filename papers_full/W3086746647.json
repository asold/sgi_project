INTRODUCTION\nIsolated bidirectional DC-DC converters are widely used in\nelectric vehicles, new energy generation and other micro grid\nsystems with energy storage devices for galvanic isolation,\nsoft switching and buck/boost functions. Storage elements\nsuch as batteries and super capacitors have the characteris-\ntics of wide range voltage variation [1], [2]. How to realize\nthe high efﬁcient operation of bidirectional converters in a\nwide range of voltage has become a major challenge. In iso-\nlated bi-directional converter, DAB is potential for inherit\nzero voltage switching and bidirectional energy ﬂow. If the\nratio of input and output voltage is equal to the turn ratio\nof transformer, DAB can realize the full load range ZVS\nand low reactive power with a single-phase-shift (SPS) con-\ntrol. Otherwise, there are a large peak current and circu-\nlating current, and ZVS cannot be guaranteed under light\nload. Large peak current leads to high conduction loss and\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Yijie Wang\n.\nswitching-off loss. Circulating current increases copper loss\nof transformer, and the turn-on switching losses will increase\nwhen soft-switching is loss. Above factors result in low efﬁ-\nciency of DAB converter and have been studied in many\npapers.\nVarious improved modulation schemes on the DAB has\nbeen proposed to expand ZVS and reduce circulating cur-\nrent in [3]–[15]. In [3], a three-level PWM switching con-\ntrol strategy was proposed to achieve full-load ZVS by\ndriving H-bridge with internal phase-shifting at high volt-\nage side. When the voltage conversation gain is not 1, the\nextended phase-shifting (EPS) will be used to expand the\nsoft switching range and reduce the circulating current [4].\nDual phase shift (DPS) that inner phase-shift on both pri-\nmary and secondary H-bridge for the regulated duty cycle\nand outer phase-shift between the primary and secondary\nvoltages was proposed in [5]. The directions of phase shift on\nboth sides of H-bridge are opposite, which can improve the\nefﬁciency at the light load [6]. Power loss of DAB with the\nDPS control is analyzed and the relevant control strategy is\n170568\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.\nFor more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ VOLUME 8, 2020\nY. Liang et al.: Dual-Transformer-Based Bidirectional DC–DC Converter of Using Blocking Capacitor for Wide ZVS Range\ngiven in [7]. In [8], a composite scheme combing SPS and\nDPS was proposed to extend soft-switching. Furthermore,\ntriple phase shift (TPS) including three variables is adopted\nto improve the performance of DAB converter in [9]. For\ndifferent optimization objectives, such as the total losses,\nRMS of inductor current, and inductor current stress were\ndeveloped to improve the performance in [10]–[15]. But these\nalgorithms are based on complex mathematical calculation\nand the optimization target is highly dependent on the system\nparameters. These modulation strategies only can improve\nefﬁciency in narrow voltage output range.\nVarious simple modiﬁed topologies were proposed to over-\ncome the low efﬁciency in wide output voltage range of\ntraditional DAB converters [16], [17]. In [16], a DC blocking\ncapacitor connected in series with the primary winding of\ntransformer is introduced. There are two working modes\nof the H-bridge on the primary side, i.e. full- and half-\nbridge, which makes the voltage conversation around 1. For\nexample, when voltage gain K =nV2/V1 =0.5, where V1\nis input voltage and V2 is the output voltage, the primary\nbridge can work as half-bridge so that the voltage gain is 1.\nIn [17], a hybrid modulation strategy was proposed with\nblocking capacitors in series with both primary and secondary\nwindings, which comprehensively considered the principle of\nminimum inductance current. Considering the high voltage\nin micro-grid, [18]–[20] reported a DC-DC converter with\nneutral point clamped (NPC) three-level structure. In [18],\nasymmetric PWM plus phase-shift control is used to realize\nwide voltage and high efﬁciency operation where K is greater\nthan 2. Although they can achieve lower inductor current to\nimprove the efﬁciency in wider gain range, ZVS cannot be\nensured under quite a part of working conditions.\nTo achieve ZVS in a wide operation range, a dual-\ntransformer asymmetrical dual-bridge which can work in\nbuck and boost modes was proposed in [21]. However, the\npower ﬂow is unidirectional. In [22] a dual-transformer struc-\nture was proposed for two variable input voltage. In [23]\nthree-level T-type isolated bidirectional DC–DC converter\nwas reported. The four-level voltage was generated to match\nthe output voltage for a hybrid bridge-based DAB con-\nverter in [24]. PWM plus phase-shift control based on dual\ntransformers active bridge (DTAB) converter was proposed\nin [25]. In both [24] and [25], the primary side can generate\na continuous adjustable voltage to match the output voltage\nwhich achieves a wide ZVS range for most switches. But\nthere is a limited ZVS range for phase-shift leg on primary\nside with reverse mode and the efﬁciency is improved with\nK =(0.5-1). However, to apply the DC-DC converter for the\nbattery chargers in the electric vehicles (EVs), a wider output\nvoltage range is required (e.g., 200V-450V). The ranges of\nvoltage gain K in the previous DC-DC converters are not wide\nenough for the battery charging and discharging.\nTherefore, to achieve ZVS in wide conversion gain\nrange and satisfy most battery charging and discharging\nrange, a dual-transformer-based full bridge converter using\na block capacitor was proposed. For the proposed converter,\nfour-level voltage on secondary winding is regulated to match\noutput voltage according to voltage second balance on both\nboost and buck modes. The proposed converter expands the\nZVS range with not only K =(0.5-1) but also K =(1-1.5).\nWhen power ﬂow is reverse, a mirror-symmetrical modula-\ntion is used to avoid a seriously limited ZVS range in reverse\nmode compared with DTAB converter. A 300W prototype is\nestablished to verify the theoretical analysis.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Section II, the\ndual-transformer-based full bridge converter with a block-\ning capacitor is illustrated. The power characteristics of\nconverter, operation principle and ZVS range are deduced.\nA comparison with DTAB converter and DAB converter is\ndemonstrated in Section III. In Section IV , the experimental\nresults are presented based on a 300W prototype. Finally, the\nconclusion is in Section V.\nII. TOPOLOGY AND MODULATION SCHEME\nA. TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURE AND MODULATION\nMETHOD\nThe topology consists of three bridge legs on the primary\nside and a H-bridge on the secondary side. The transformers\nT1 and T 2 are connected in parallel on primary and series\nconnection on secondary. A blocking capacitor is in series\nconnected in primary winding and a transmission inductor is\nin series connected in secondary winding as shown in Fig. 1.\nFIGURE 1. Dual transformer based active bridge DC-DC converter.\nThe typical voltage/current waveforms in the boost mode\nfor this dual-transformer converter are shown in Fig. 2. The\ncase of 0 <φ< d is given as an example to explain the oper-\nation principle, where d is the duty cycle of the primary side\nand φis the phase shift ratio between vs and vB1B2. The duty\ncycle d is adjusted to extend ZVS range, by regulating the\nfour-level voltage vs in the secondary side of the transformers\nto match a variable voltage vB1B2 according to voltage-second\nbalance. The phase shift ratio φ is controlled to regulate\npower ﬂow. Two full bridges on the primary side share the\ncommon leg including S 13 and S14. The full bridge connected\nwith T2 can operate in either the half bridge or the full bridge\nmode. When S11 keeps off and S 12 keeps on, the full bridge\nconnected with T 2 works as the half bridge mode. An offset\nDC voltage can be introduced on the blocking capacitor and\nvs equals n2V1/2 +n1V1, which is corresponding to the buck\nmode of the converter. If the full bridge connected with T 2\nwork as the full bridge mode, there is no offset DC voltage\non the blocking capacitor and vs equals n2V1 +n1V1, which\nis corresponding to the boost mode of the converter.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 170569\nY. Liang et al.: Dual-Transformer-Based Bidirectional DC–DC Converter of Using Blocking Capacitor for Wide ZVS Range\nFIGURE 2. Typical waveforms in the boost mode.\nB. OPERATION MODES ANALYSIS\nSince the steady state waveform is symmetrical in the positive\nand negative half switching cycles. Only half cycle operation\nmode needs to be analyzed, which can be divided into six\nintervals from t0 to t6 as presented in Fig. 2. The correspond-\ning equivalent circuits are shown in Fig. 3.\nStage 1 (t 0-t1): before t0, S16, S22 and S23 have been con-\nducting and other switches remain off. At t0, S12 and S13 are\nturned ON. During this interval, vs is equal to n1V1+n2V1 and\nvB1B2 is equal to −V2. The voltage applied to L is vs −vB1B2.\nAt the beginning of this interval, the inductor current iL starts\nto increase with a constant slew rate, which can be expressed\nas:\niL (t −t0) =iL (t0) +(n1V1 +n2V1 +V2)(t −t0)/L (1)\nStage 2 (t 1-t2): Before the turn-on of S 21 and S 24, the\ninductor current iL is positive as shown in Fig.2. At time t1,\nS22 and S 23 are turned off. The inductor current iL begins to\ndischarge the parasitic capacitor of S 21 and S 24 from V2/2\nto zero and to charge the parasitic capacitor of S 22 and S 23\nfrom zero to V2/2. When the charging and discharging process\nis over, iL freewheels through body diode of S 21 and S 24 as\niL is positive. S 21 and S 24 is turned on before iL changes its\npolarity. Because the charging and discharging process is very\nshort and can be ignored to simplify ZVS analysis. Hence, the\nZVS constraints for S 21 and S24 can be obtained as\niL (t1) >0 (2)\nStage 3 (t 2-t3): At t2, S 21 and S 24 is turned ON under\nZVS. In this interval, the secondary-side voltage of the two\ntransformers vs is still equal to n1V1+n2V1 and vB1B2 changes\nto V2. In this interval, the inductor current iL is increasing with\na lower constant slew rate, and iL can be expressed as\niL (t −t2) =iL (t2) +(n1V1 +n2V1 −V2)(t −t2)/L (3)\nStage 4 (t3-t4): At t3, ip1 arrive at peak current. S16 is turned\nOFF.ip1 begins to discharge the parasitic capacitor of S 15 and\ncharge the parasitic capacitor of S 16. After this charging and\ndischarging process, ip1 freewheels through the body diode of\nS15 as ip1 is positive. S 15 is turned on before ip1 changes its\npolarity. The ZVS constraints for S 15 is\nip1(t3) =iL (t3)n1 >0 (4)\nFIGURE 3. Equivalent circuit for each mode. (a) Stage 1. (b) Stage 2. (c) Stage 3. (d) Stage 4. (e) Stage 5. (f) Stage 6.\n170570 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY. Liang et al.: Dual-Transformer-Based Bidirectional DC–DC Converter of Using Blocking Capacitor for Wide ZVS Range\nStage 5 (t 4-t5): At t4, S15 is turned ON under ZVS. During\nthis interval, vA1A2 changes to be zero and vs becomes n2V1.\nThe inductor current expressions for iL can be obtained as\niL (t −t4) =iL (t4) +(n2V1 −V2)(t −t4)/L (5)\nStage 6 (t 5-t6): S13 and S12 is turned OFF at t5. During this\ninterval, the parasitic capacitor of S 14 and S 11 is discharged\nfrom V2/2 to zero. At the end of this stage, ip2 freewheels\nthrough the bode diode of S 11, and ip1 +ip2 freewheels\nthrough the bode diode of S 14. The ZVS constraints for S 14\nand S11 can be obtained as\n{\nip2(t5) =iL (t5)n2 >0 (S 11)\nip1(t5) +ip2(t5) =iL (t5)(n1 +n2) >0 (S 14) (6)\nC. POWER CHARACTERISTICS\nThe full bridge connected with T 2 is as full bridge in the\nboost mode with K = (1∼1.5). There are three possible\ncombinations that consist of d and φfor pattern A:0 <φ <\nd, pattern B: d <φ <0.5 and pattern C: d −0.5 <φ <0.\nThe simpliﬁed operating waveforms are illustrated in Fig. 4.\nIgnoring the loss of the circuit, the output power can be\ncalculated as:\nP = 1\nTs\n∫ t6\nt0\nvsiL (t)dt (7)\nAccording to three possible working patterns and current\nvalue, the output average power can be obtained as (8), as\nshown at the bottom of the next page.\nThe average power is illustrated in Fig.5 with duty-cycle\nand phase-shift control. At different duty cycles, three work-\ning patterns can be obtained for the power transfer. Similar\nto the DAB converter, the maximum power transfer can be\nobserved at different duty cycles and phase shift angles.\nFIGURE 4. Typical simplified operating waveforms in boost and forward\nmode. (a) A: 0<φ< d. (b) B:d <φ< 0.5. (c) C:d −0.5 <φ< 0.\nWhen the full bridge connected with T 2 works as a half\nbridge in the buck mode with K =(0.5∼1), n2V1 in Fig.4 will\nFIGURE 5. Power characteristics with different duty cycle in boost mode.\nchange to n2V1/2. There are also three possible combinations\nthat consist of d and φ(0 <φ< d, d <φ< 0.5, d −0.5 <\nφ <0). The output average power can be obtained as (9), as\nshown at the bottom of the next page.\nThe normalized power PBASE and corresponding normal-\nized current IBASE are deﬁned as follows:\nPBASE =KV 2\n1 Ts/8L (10)\nIBASE =V1Ts/8L (11)\nAs shown in Fig.6, the mirror-symmetrical modulation\nis introduced in reverse power ﬂow. The typical voltage\nand current waveforms are mirror-symmetrical to those in\nFig.4 (a). The reverse power characteristics have the same\noperation modes. The power characteristics in reverse mode\nare symmetrical to those in forward mode with respect to\noutput voltage.\nFIGURE 6. Typical voltage and current waveforms in the reverse flow.\nD. ZVS CONSTRAINS AND BASIC OPERATION PRINCIPLE\nIt can be seen from part B that the ZVS implementation of\ncorresponding switch is based on the current polarity of the\ntransformer when switch is turned ON ignoring the charge\nand discharge time. The constraints for ZVS of all switches\nare listed in Table 1.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 170571\nY. Liang et al.: Dual-Transformer-Based Bidirectional DC–DC Converter of Using Blocking Capacitor for Wide ZVS Range\nTABLE 1. ZVS current constraints.\nApplying volt-second balance principle, the integration of\nthe inductor current is zero in one cycle as:\n1\nTs\n∫ t6\nt0\niL (t)tdt =0 (12)\nTake pattern A for example, in one cycle, the instantaneous\nsecondary current value has the following relationship at the\ninstants of turning on.\n\n\n\ni(t1)=−i(t4)=i(t0)+(n1V1 +n2V1 −V2)(t1 −t0)/L\ni(t2)=−i(t5)=i(t1)+(n1V1 +n2V1 −V2)(t2 −t1)/L\ni(t3) =−i(t 6) =i(t2) +(n1V1 −V2)(t3 −t2)/L\n(13)\nFrom equations (12) and (13), the current values required\nin Table 1 can be deduced as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni(t0) =−i(t 3) =−(2V 2φ+n1V1d\n+0.5n2V1Ts −0.5V2Ts)/2L\ni(t1) =−i(t 4) =(−n1V1d −0.5n2V1Ts\n+0.5V2Ts +2n2V1φ+2n1V1φ)/2L\ni(t2) =−i(t 5) =(2n2V1d +n1V1d −0.5n2V1Ts\n+0.5V2Ts −2V2d +2V2φ)/2L\n(14)\nSubstituting equation (14) into the current constraints in\nTable 1, the relationships between duty cycle and phase-shift\nunder different voltage for ZVS are shown in Table 2.\nIt can be seen from Table 2 that ZVS conditions are\nthe inequality expressions about d, φ, and the transformer\nturns ratios n1 and n2. There are many ZVS optimiza-\ntion objectives for the switches with four variables. While,\nall the inequalities in Table 2 contain the same factor:\nE =V2 −mn2V1 −2dn1V1. When E is equal to zero, the\nZVS conditions for S 11, S 12, S 13, S 14 and S 21, S 22, S 23, S 24\ncan be ensured under full load range. In fact, when m =1 and\nm =0.5, E =0 means voltage-second balance [26] in boost\nmode and buck mode as shown in Fig. 7.\nFIGURE 7. Voltage-second balance on the inductorL. (a) boost mode.\n(b) buck mode.\nFor the input side, the voltage-second product is deﬁned\nas the time integral of a half-cycle of the secondary winding\nvoltage. For the output side, the product of voltage value in\nhalf-cycle is rectangular area. The relationship of voltages\n(vs, vB1B2) on both sides of the transmission inductor L can\nbe expressed as\nn1V1dTs +mn2V1Ts/2 =V2Ts/2 (15)\nThe duty ratio d according to equation (15), which can\nsatisfy inductor voltage-second balance in boost and buck\nmode is calculated as follow:\nd =(V2 −mn2V1)/2n1V1 (16)\nE. THE TRANSFORMER TURNS RATIO AND ZVS RANGE\nFor the proposed converter, the input voltage is V1 and the\noutput voltage variation is V2min ∼V2max. The voltage gain\nK is from 0.5∼1.5. Hence, Kmax = 3 Kmin and V2max =\n3V2min.

When m =0.5, VA2A3 is V1/2 and\nduty ratio d can be set to 0∼0.5 to match the output voltage\nV2min ∼V2min +(V2max −V2min)/2. At output voltage V2 =\nV2min, duty ratio d =0. When m =1, VA2A3 is V1 and duty\nratio d can be set to 0∼0.5 to match the output voltage V2min+\n(V2max −V2min)/2 ∼V2max. At output voltage V2 =V2max,\nduty ratio d =0.5. Then the following relationship can be\nobtained:\n\n\n\nn1 +n2 =V2 max\nV1\nn2/2 =V2 min\nV1\n(18)\nBecause of V2max/V2min =3, the turns ratio for two trans-\nformers should satisfy n2 =2n1.\nIn Table 2, when the time integral of vs equals to vB1B2, the\nswitches always can be turned ON under ZVS except S 15 and\nS16. ZVS conditions of S 15 and S 16 are dependent on d and\nφ.

There are two\ndecoupled variables d and φ. d is independent of φ and\nvaries with output voltage to satisfy voltage-second balance\non the inductor. The maximum power of proposed converter\nis monotonically increasing with K from 0.5 to 1.5 as shown\nin Fig.9 (a). It is because the constant input voltage V1 is\nadjusted by duty cycle to match the varying output voltage V2.\nThe maximum power with variable gain in DTAB is as shown\nas Fig.9 (b). It’s monotonically decreasing from 0.5 to 1. It\nis because the varying output voltage V2 is adjusted by duty\ncycle to match the constant input voltage V1. The maximum\npower of DAB is 1 (p.u.) with variable gain in traditional DAB\nconverter as shown in Fig.9 (c). In practical application, the\nrated power is designed smaller than 0.5 (p.u.) in order to limit\nthe reactive power [27] [28], which is illustrated as shadow\npart in the proposed converter. The power range of proposed\nconverter is enough to satisfy the requirements of most wide\noutput voltage situations.\nB. ZVS RANGE\nAs mentioned in the section II, only considering current\npolarity at turn-on instant for ZVS constrains, the region of\nhard-switching for S 15 and S 16 is very small and the other\nVOLUME 8, 2020 170573\nY.

(c) DAB.\nswitches can turn on under ZVS in whole region as shown in\nFig.10 (a). There is a limited ZVS range without a symmet-\nrical modulation in reverse mode for S 3 and S4 with K from\n0.5 to 1 in DTAB as shown in Fig.10 (b). Moreover, it works\nas a traditional DAB in the range of 1-1.5. In Fig.10 (c), the\ntraditional DAB suffers from secondary-side hard-switching\nwith K from 0.5 to 1 and primary-side hard-switching with K\nfrom 1 to 1.5 at light load. Obviously, the proposed converter\nobtains a wider ZVS range in actual working region.\nC. THE TRANSFORMER CURRENT\nThe loss of dual-transformer-based converter mainly consists\nof two parts: switching loss and transformer loss. When\nthe switch turns on at ZVS, switching loss is determined\nby switching off loss and conduction loss which is propor-\ntional to RMS current ﬂowing through the switch. Accord-\ningly, transformer losses are divided into coil losses and core\nlosses. The coil loss is proportional to RMS current. Thus,\nthe transformer RMS current is a signiﬁcant speciﬁcation\nfor the proposed converter. Fig. 11 shows the plots of the\nnormalized transformer secondary RMS current of the pro-\nposed converter, DTAB and traditional DAB converter when\nthe normalized active power P is 0.4 (p.u.) and 0.1 (p.u.),\nrespectively. RMS current in DTAB is lower at relatively\nlow voltage gain. Four-level is generated based a varying\noutput voltage to match a constant input voltage in DTAB,\nhence a smaller φis obtained for DTAB at the same power.\nWith the gain increasing, the proposed converter has lower\nRMS current especially at light load. This advantage helps\nthe proposed converter to reduce transformer winding loss\nand switches conduction loss in most gain range.\nThe magnitude of peak current is related to the switching\nloss. The turn-off loss of the switching device is determined\nby the current magnitude at the instants of switching off.\nFIGURE 11. the normalized transformer RMS current versus voltage ratio\nK. (a)P =0.1 (p.u.). (b)P =0.4 (p.u.).\nFor example, the current of S 15 reaches its peak value at the\ninstants of switching off as shown in Fig.2. The magnitude\nof peak current can be derived in (14). Fig. 12 shows the\nnormalized peak current of the transformer secondary wind-\ning with different K. Similar to RMS current, peak current\nin DTAB is lower at relatively low voltage gain. But the\nproposed converter has lower peak current in most gain range.\nFIGURE 12. Normalized peak current versus voltage ratioK. (a)P =0.1\n(p.u.). (b)P =0.4 (p.u.).\nD. THE TRANSFORMER CAPACITY\nThe proposed converter operates at a constant input voltage\nV1 and a variable output voltage n2V1/2 −3n2V1/2. When\nthe full bridge connected with T 2 works as half bridge, the\nvoltage amplitude applied to transformers T 1 and T2 is V1/2.\nThe transmission capacity of transformer T 1 is equal to that\nof T2 with d =0.5. When the full bridge connected with T 2\nworks as full bridge, the transmission capacity of transformer\nT1 is half of that of T 2 with d =0.5. Finally, transformer T 1\ncapacity is designed as half of T 2 transmission capacity when\nd =0.5 in boost mode.\nIV. EXPERIMENT\nA. VERIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED CONVERTER\nThe output power is designed as 0.5 (p.u.) with different\noutput voltage as shown in the shadow area of Fig. 9 (a).\nA 300 W laboratory test setup with K =1.5 was established\nto validate the proposed converter and the parameters are\nshown in Table 3. The photo of the experimental setup is\nshown in Fig. 13. The primary side of the converter is con-\nnected with a 50 V constant DC power supply. DC output port\nof secondary side is connected to the battery simulator. DSP\n170574 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY.

EFFICIENCY AND LOSS DISTRIBUTION\nIn order to verify the performance of the proposed converter, a\ntraditional DAB converter and DTAB are used for comparison\nat same active power. For the justiﬁcation of comparison,\nthe half bridge connected to a constant voltage in DTAB\nis replaced with a full bridge. The efﬁciency versus output\nvoltage at 80% of load and 20% of load is plotted in Fig. 19.\nWhen V2 is 50 V (K = 1), DAB is more efﬁcient than\nproposed converter and DTAB for one less transformer. When\nthe gain is away from the optimal operating point (K =1),\nthe proposed converter is more efﬁcient. This phenomenon is\nattributed to lower transformer RMS current and wider soft\nswitching region especially in light load for the proposed\nconverter. Although the DTAB is more efﬁcient in quite\nlow output voltage, it only obtains improved efﬁciency from\n0.5 to 1.\nFIGURE 19. Efficiency versus output voltage at different loads in forward\nmode. (a)P =0.4 (p.u.). (b)P =0.1 (p.u.).\nThe measured efﬁciency of proposed converter, DAB and\nDTAB from 20% load to 100% load is illustrated in Fig. 20.\nWhen output voltage is 40 V , the efﬁciency of proposed con-\nverter is very close to that of DTAB, which is more efﬁcient\nthan traditional DAB converter as shown in Fig. 20 (a). That’s\nbecause DAB converter has a narrow ZVS range at light\nload. When the load reaches 60% to 100% in reverse mode,\nDTAB suffers from hard switching as shown in Fig 10 (b),\n170576 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY. Liang et al.: Dual-Transformer-Based Bidirectional DC–DC Converter of Using Blocking Capacitor for Wide ZVS Range\nFIGURE 20. Normalized load efficiency at different output voltage.\n(a) V2 =40 V. (b)V2 =70 V.\nwhich leads a low efﬁciency. In relatively high output voltage\nrange (over 70 V), the proposed converter exhibits distinct\nadvantage over the other two converters.\nFIGURE 21. Loss evaluation with the normalized active powerP =0.4\n(p.u.) with 80% load. (a)V1 =40 V in reverse mode. (b)V2 =70 V in\nforward mode.\nFig.21 shows the loss evaluation for the dual transformer\nbased converter with the proposed converter when normal-\nized power P is 0.4 (p.u.), corresponding to 80% of full load.\nAs shown in Fig.21 (a), for reverse mode (V 1 = 40 V),\nswitching loss of DTAB is bigger because of hard switching.\nFor forward mode (V 2 =70 V), DAB and DTAB have higher\nswitching loss for hard switching and conduction loss for\nlarge RMS current in Fig.21 (b).\nV. CONCLUSION\nTo achieve ZVS in wide conversion gain range to satisfy\nbattery charging and discharging, a dual-transformer-based\nfull bridge converter using a block capacitor was proposed.\nThe duty cycle of primary side is adjusted to extend ZVS\nrange by regulating the four-level voltage in the secondary\nside of the transformers to match a variable output voltage\naccording to voltage-second balance in both boost and buck\nmodes. It enables efﬁcient operation within K =(0.5-1.5).\nThe mirror-symmetrical modulation is used to obtain a wide\nZVS range in reverse power ﬂow. The performances of\nthe proposed converter were compared to the published\ndual-transformer converter in terms of power characteristics,\nZVS range and RMS current to demonstrate the advantages.\nA 300 W prototype is implemented to verify the effective-\nness of the proposed converter. Theoretical and experimental\nresults demonstrate the proposed converter is suitable for\nwide output range.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Shao, H. Chen, X. Wu, J. Zhang, and K.
