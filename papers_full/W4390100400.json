    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLM) for various natural language processing tasks, little is known about their comprehension of geographic data and related ability to facilitate informed geospatial decision-making. This paper investigates the extent of geospatial knowledge, awareness, and reasoning abilities encoded within such pretrained LLMs. With a focus on autoregressive language models, we devise experimental approaches related to (i) probing LLMs for geo-coordinates to assess geospatial knowledge, (ii) using geospatial and non-geospatial prepositions to gauge their geospatial awareness, and (iii) utilizing a multidimensional scaling (MDS) experiment to assess the models' geospatial reasoning capabilities and to determine locations of cities based on prompting. Our results confirm that it does not only take larger but also more sophisticated LLMs to synthesize geospatial knowledge from textual information. As such, this research contributes to understanding the potential and limitations of LLMs in dealing with geospatial information.",
