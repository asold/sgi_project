    "abstract": "Abstract Classical machine learning has been actively utilized in astronomy to address various challenges, including predicting orbital stability, classifying asteroids, galaxies, and other objects, and analyzing images. However, the emerging trend in artificial intelligence involves the use of large language models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT. These models are trained on a large corpus of text and can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and classification. Surprisingly, these capabilities present significant potential for application in astronomy. This paper demonstrates how the new model gpt-4-vision-preview can analyze visual patterns and accurately classify asteroids as resonant or nonresonant with high accuracy. This process requires no training, fine-tuning, or coding beyond writing the appropriate prompt in natural language. Moreover, this approach can be extended to other common problems within astronomy.",
