J. Bosch1,2, T. Hanna1,2, K. A. Fercho1,2 & L. A. Baugh1,2\nHabitual tool use is considered a hallmark of human evolution. One potential explanation for \nhumanity’s advanced tool using abilities is that humans possess a unique neurobiological system \nthat estimates efficient ways to manipulate objects with novel tools, resulting in rapid tool use motor \nlearning. However, since humans regularly use a multitude of tools, examining these underlying \nprocesses is challenging. As such, we developed a tool use motor learning paradigm that utilizes a \nchallenging tool (chopsticks) in order to accomplish a difficult behavioral task that requires extensive \npractice to continuously improve one’s proficiency. We then assessed the paradigm by recruiting \nparticipants with little experience using chopsticks and training them over the course of eight training \nsessions to grasp marbles with chopsticks and drop them in a cylindrical container. Throughout training, \nwe examined behavioral performance and visual strategies to determine whether practicing the task \nresulted in outcomes congruent with traditional motor learning. Results show that performance \nincreases in a logarithmic pattern and is accompanied by decreased confirmatory visual strategies. \nSince these findings are congruent with those seen in traditional motor learning, this paradigm is a \nnovel method for use in future research examining the underlying mechanisms that mediate tool use \nmotor learning.\nHumanity’s advanced tool using capabilities are considered a hallmark of evolution and are thought to facilitate \nrapid advancements in technology\n1. However, studying the mechanisms that underlie tool use motor learning \nin humans is challenging due to the ease and regularity that humans use tools. In previous examinations of tool \nuse motor learning, simple tools that require little practice to gain proficiency have been used to characterize the \nunderlying mechanisms mediating the acquisition of skilled tool use\n2,3. As such, it is important to establish a tool \nuse motor learning paradigm that utilizes a tool that is challenging to use and a behavioral task where one can \ncontinuously improve their performance through practice. In this study, we developed a behavioral task where \nindividuals use chopsticks to grasp marbles and drop them in a cylindrical container. We then assessed behavioral \nperformance and visual strategies in individuals who were naïve to the use of chopsticks while they performed the \ntask over the course of eight behavioral training sessions.\nAlthough multiple species possess the ability to use tools\n4, only humans possess an advanced technological \nculture which emphasizes their use and manufacture1,5–7. In addition to widespread use, humans are able to rap-\nidly acquire the ability to skillfully use new tools8, whereas non-human primates undergo a significant trial and \nerror period before acquiring the ability to use a new tool 9. One potential explanation for humanity’s advanced \ntool using capabilities is that humans possess cognitive abilities that facilitate experience-independent tool action \nrepresentation5. For example, a region of the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is consistently active in humans \nduring tool use action observation 10,11, whereas non-human primates do not exhibit activation in homologous \nregions of their brains during tool use action observation. These findings suggest that humans may possess a \nunique neurobiological system tuned to represent unfamiliar tools\n12,13. However, given how regularly and easily \nhumans use tools, examining the tool use motor learning process is challenging.

As such, in order to gain a better understanding of these \nunderlying mechanisms, it is important to establish a tool use motor learning paradigm that utilizes a tool that is \nchallenging to use in order to accomplish a behavioral task that is also challenging and that one can continuously \nimprove their performance through practice.\nIn traditional motor learning paradigms, skill acquisition while performing a novel motor action occurs over \na logarithmic time scale\n14,15. In other words, when one begins performing a novel motor action, increases in per-\nformance occur rapidly. However, as one continues practicing the novel action, increased performance becomes \nprogressively more difficult to achieve over time. Therefore, assessing whether performance during motor skill \nacquisition increases over a logarithmic time scale is an effective method for examining motor learning.\nIn addition to measuring overt performance during motor skill acquisition, another method for examining \nthe motor learning process is by examining how visual strategies change as one learns a new motor skill\n16,17. Since \nthe visual and motor systems are tightly linked 18–21, increases in overt behavioral performance are often com-\nplemented by changes in covert visual strategies17,22. For example, as one learns to shoot a basketball for the first \ntime, the initial stage of motor learning involves learning the new spatial relationship between one’s hand and the \nbasketball. During this initial stage, the visual system is focused on exploring the novel spatial relationship, result-\ning in a high number of confirmatory visual strategies (i.e. fixations that are centered on the interaction between \none’s body and the object or environment)\n22,23 and longer average fixation durations in order to extract as much \nvisual information about the new relationship as possible24. In the case of shooting a basketball, this initial stage of \nmotor learning would be primarily characterized by visual strategies that confirm effective interactions between \nthe hand and the basketball. While these initial strategies do not manifest in high behavioral performance\n25, they \nare important for establishing new spatial relationships.\nAfter this initial exploratory stage, individuals gradually shift their visual strategies from confirmatory to \nanticipatory (i.e. fixations that are centered on the desired goal of the task) 22. These strategies are predictive in \nnature19,24,26,27 and are positively correlated with increases in behavioral performance 22,25,28,29. To return to the \nbasketball example, after one becomes familiar with the proper interaction between the hand and the ball, their \nvisual strategies will shift to the basketball hoop and will lead the basketball to its desired location. In addition to \nincreasing the percentage of anticipatory visual strategies, motor skill acquisition is also accompanied by shorter \nfixation durations\n17, indicating that less time is needed to extract the necessary visual information for performing \nthe action. Finally, since visual information can be extracted from peripheral vision as well as foveal vision 27, \nincreases in anticipatory visual strategies may also be accompanied by increases in the distance that the anticipa-\ntory strategy leads the hand or object.\nTherefore, in the current study, we sought to develop and test a challenging tool use motor learning paradigm \nthat is characterized by continuous improvements in behavioral performance through practice and accompanied \nby observable shifts in visual strategies. To accomplish this goal, we recruited research subjects who were naïve to \nthe use of chopsticks and trained them to use this tool to perform a challenging behavioral task: grasping a marble \nwith the chopsticks, lifting the marble to the apex of a cylindrical container, dropping the marble into the con-\ntainer, and continuing this action as many times as possible over the course of multiple one-minute trials. Over \nthe course of eight behavioral training sessions, we assessed their behavioral performance while they performed \nthe task to determine whether they could continuously improve their skill. In addition, during the first and final \ntraining sessions, we obtained eye-tracking measurements during performance to determine whether changes in \nvisual strategies that accompany traditional motor learning also occur during tool use motor learning.\nWe predicted that subjects would continuously improve their performance throughout training, as reflected \nby the number of successfully completed marble drops, indicating that the behavioral task was challenging \nenough that individuals could continue to refine and improve their skill through practice. Furthermore, we pre-\ndicted that increases in performance may best be represented by a logarithmic function, suggesting that the tool \nuse paradigm employed reflects traditional principles of motor learning. For ocular behavior, we predicted that \nconfirmatory visual strategies would be most prominent during the first behavioral training session, indicating \nthat individuals were initially exploring the new spatial relationship between their hand, the chopsticks, and the \nmarble. In comparison, we hypothesized that during the final behavioral training session anticipatory visual \nstrategies would be most prominent, indicating that individuals shifted their attention from exploring the new \nspatial relationship to leading the chopsticks to the final behavioral goal. In addition to the distribution of visual \nstrategies, we also predicted that the vertical distance between the chopsticks and the final behavioral goal during \nanticipatory gaze strategies would increase after training. This finding would be indicative of individuals being \nable to lead the chopsticks to the final goal at a greater distance and relying less on visual information from \ntheir peripheral vision. We also predicted that the average duration of both anticipatory and confirmatory visual \nstrategies would decrease after training, based on the assumption that individuals would need to extract less \nconfirmatory visual information as they increased their ability to skillfully perform the task. Confirmation of \nthese predictions would validate this paradigm as a method for examining the tool use motor learning process by \nextending the skill acquisition period and would support its future use in examining the underlying mechanisms \nthat mediate rapid tool use motor learning in humans.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Twelve participants were recruited from the University of South Dakota (7 female, 5 male; \nmean age = 21.33 years; age range = 18–28 years). All participants were required to be right handed, as assessed \nusing a modified Edinburgh handedness inventory 30, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. In addition, \neach participant’s prior experience using chopsticks was assessed using a subjective questionnaire requiring par-\nticipants to rank their ability to skillfully use chopsticks (scale = 1–6; 6 indicating high proficiency with chopstick \nuse; included if ranking ≤ 3/6). All participants provided written informed consent for their participation in \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:13755  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32001-4\naccordance with the experimental procedures that were approved by the University of South Dakota Institutional \nReview Board. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations set \nforth by the Declaration of Helsinki.\nExperimental Procedure. Over the course of four consecutive weeks, participants performed eight behav-\nioral training sessions (two sessions per week, at least one day between sessions) in which they were trained to \nperform a task that was aimed at improving their skill level using chopsticks. The task consisted of grasping a mar-\nble (diameter of marble = 16 mm) with a pair of bamboo chopsticks (length of chopsticks = 260 mm), lifting the \nmarble to the apex of a cylindrical container (diameter of cylinder = 45 mm), and repeating the action as many \ntimes as possible over the course of ten trials (duration = 60 seconds per trial). Each participant completed the \nfirst five trials using training chopsticks with a loop for the index and middle fingers and a bridge connecting the \ntwo individual chopsticks. These training chopsticks ensured that each participant learned to perform the action \nin a similar manner but were not used to evaluate performance. Following the five trials using the training chop-\nsticks, each participant performed the next five trials using traditional chopsticks. The number of successful mar-\nble drops during each one-minute trial was recorded manually by the experimenter and later confirmed through \nvideo recordings. During the first and final behavioral training session, eye tracking recordings were obtained to \ncharacterize each participant’s visual strategies at the beginning and end of behavioral training.\nEye-Tracking Specifications. Eye tracking data was collected using a pair of SMI eye-tracking glasses and \niView ETG 2.2 experimental software (SensoMotoric Instruments, Teltow, Germany) with binocular tracking \n(sampling rate = 30 Hz; gaze tracking range = 80° horizontal, 60° vertical; accuracy = 0.5°; scene camera resolu-\ntion = 1280 × 960). Before beginning each recording, calibration was performed using points in the upper left, \nbottom left, and bottom right visual field. Following data collection, eye-tracking data was imported into BeGaze \n3.4 eye-tracking analysis software (SensoMotoric Instruments, Teltow, Germany) and the time range for each of \nthe five one-minute trials using the traditional chopsticks was manually recorded. All fixations within each trial \nwere then identified using BeGaze’s default algorithm for detecting fixations and saccades\n31 (maximum disper-\nsion = 100 pixels; minimum duration = 80 milliseconds) and exported.\nVisual Strategy Classification. Following fixation export, each fixation was individually classified using \ncustom LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) that identifies the corresponding video frame \nfrom the eye-tracker’s scene camera, and displays that frame to the experimenter for manual classification. \nClassification was initially based on whether the fixation occurred during transportation (i.e. transporting the \nmarble with the chopsticks or transporting the chopsticks after successfully dropping the marble). Fixations that \ndid not occur during transportation were removed from further analysis. In addition, fixations that were not \nexperimentally-centered or goal-oriented (e.g. fixations outside the experimental setup) were also removed from \nfurther analysis. The length and slope of the cylinder was measured in each video frame in order to account for \nchanges in each participant’s posture while performing the task. Next, the vertical distance between the chop-\nsticks tip and fixation point was calculated relative to the length and slope of the cylinder. For example, if a par-\nticipant sits close to the cylinder, the cylinder appears larger in the video frame compared to a participant sitting \nfurther away. Similarly, if a participant tilts their head during performance, the cylinder will appear rotated in \nthe video frame compared to a participant who is not tilting their head. Therefore, calculating vertical distance \nbetween regions of interest (ROIs) at the center of the chopsticks tip and the center of the fixation point relative to \nthe length and slope of the cylinder ensures that measurements are accurate regardless of the proximity or angle \nof each participant’s head relative to the cylinder. After calculating the vertical distance between ROIs, visual \nstrategies were classified as anticipatory if the fixation ROI led the chopsticks ROI by >36 mm and confirmatory if \nthe fixation ROI led the chopsticks ROI by ≤36 mm. The threshold of 36 mm was arbitrarily defined based on the \ndiameter of one of the chopstick tips (4 mm) combined with the radius of the marble (8 mm) and multiplied by \nthree to account for the dispersion algorithm utilized to define fixation points. After classifying visual strategies \nbased on the distance between the fixation point and the chopsticks tip, anticipatory and confirmatory strategies \nwere further classified based on whether they occurred while holding the marble with the chopsticks or while \nholding the chopsticks without the marble (See Fig. 1 for examples of each visual strategy).\nData Analysis. Behavioral Data Analysis. Behavioral results were quantified as the number of successful \nmarble drops per minute (MDPM) during the five trials using the traditional chopsticks. These metrics were then \nanalyzed using a repeated measures ANOV A (critical α threshold = 0.05) across behavioral training sessions in \nSPSS (SPSS Statistics 20, IBM Corporation). To correct for multiple comparisons, subsequent pairwise compari-\nsons between each training session were adjusted using the Holm-Bonferroni method. Effect sizes were calculated \nusing Pearson’s r correlations.\nIn addition to MDPM, performance speed during separate phases of the task were determined to isolate tool \nlearning (i.e. time to grasp, time to lift and drop) from phases of the task involving tool movement but no tool use \n(i.e. returning to the base of the cylinder after successfully dropping the marble). Two-tailed paired samples t-tests \nwere used to determine changes between the first and final behavioral training session for each phase. Corrections \nfor multiple comparisons and effect sizes were computed in an analogous manner to MDPM.\nEye Tracking Data Analysis. Eye tracking data was initially analyzed based on the percentage of anticipatory \nvisual strategies compared to the percentage of confirmatory visual strategies between the first and final training \nsessions. These percentages were computed relative to the total number of visual strategies (anticipatory + con-\nfirmatory) and were used as input for a generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis with visual strategy \n(anticipatory, confirmatory) and training session (first session, final session) as within-subjects factors. Since \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nScientific  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:13755  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32001-4\nthe percentages of anticipatory and confirmatory strategies for each session sum to 100%, only the main effect of \nvisual strategy and the interaction between visual strategy and training session were examined.\nWhile examining the percentages of anticipatory and confirmatory visual strategies reveals an indication of \nthe overall distribution of each strategy compared to the total number of possible strategies, we were also inter-\nested in determining whether changes in this distribution were due to changes in the number of anticipatory \nstrategies, changes in the number of confirmatory strategies, or a combination of both. To accomplish this, the \ntotal number of anticipatory and confirmatory visual strategies occurring in a single session was normalized \nbased on the participant’s behavioral performance during that session (i.e. fixations per successful marble drop). \nThese normalized values were then used as input for a two-way repeated measures ANOV A with visual strategy \n(anticipatory, confirmatory) and training session (first session, final session) as within-subjects factors.\nFollowing these initial analyses, additional Spearman’s Rho correlations were performed comparing the \npercentage of anticipatory visual strategies and behavioral performance for both the first and final behavioral \ntraining session. Since any significant correlations between the percentage of anticipatory visual strategies and \nbehavioral performance would be identical when comparing confirmatory visual strategies and behavioral per-\nformance – though reversed in directionality – only these initial correlations were performed.\nIn addition to determining how the distribution and number of anticipatory and confirmatory visual strat-\negies change as a function of behavioral training, we were also interested in determining how these strategies \nchange depending on the difficulty of the movement. For example, transporting the marble from the base of the \ncylinder to the apex of the cylinder requires one to consider both the relationship between the hand and the chop-\nsticks as well as the relationship between the chopsticks and the marble. In contrast, transporting the chopsticks \nback to the base of the cylinder after successfully dropping the marble into the cylinder only requires one to con-\nsider the relationship between the hand and the chopsticks. With this in mind, we first determined the percentage \nof anticipatory and confirmatory strategies occurring while transporting the marble and those occurring after \nsuccessfully dropping the marble relative to the total number of visual strategies in a particular session. These \npercentages were then used as input for a GEE analysis with visual strategy (anticipatory, confirmatory), difficulty \n(with marble, without marble), and training session (first session, final session) as within-subjects factors.\nNext, we were interested in determining whether training and movement difficulty affected the average dura-\ntion of each visual strategy. Therefore, the average duration of each fixation was used to perform a three-way \nrepeated measures ANOV A with visual strategy (anticipatory, confirmatory), difficulty (with marble, without \nmarble), and training session (first session, final session) as within-subject factors.\nFinally, we examined whether training and movement difficulty affected the distance which an anticipatory \nvisual strategy led the movement. To accomplish this, we used the average vertical distance between the chop-\nsticks and the fixation point as input for a two-way repeated measures ANOV A with difficulty (with marble, \nwithout marble) and training session (first session, final session) as within-subjects factors.\nFigure 1. Examples of Visual Strategies – Anticipatory visual strategies were those where the vertical distance \nbetween the fixation point and the chopsticks tip was >36 mm. Confirmatory visual strategies were those where \nthe vertical distance between the fixation point and the chopsticks tip was ≤36 mm. Visual strategies occurring \nwhile transporting the marble to the apex of the cylinder (with marble) were differentiated from those occurring \nafter successfully dropping the marble into the cylinder and returning the chopsticks to the base of the cylinder \n(without marble).

The mean familiarity for chopstick use reported was 1.83 on a six-point \nscale. For MDPM, we observed a main effect of training on behavioral performance [F (7, 77) = 23.404; p < 0.001] \n(Fig. 2A). Subsequent pairwise comparisons revealed significant increases in performance between session one \n[M = 14.217; SEM = 1.531] and session two [M = 21.117; SEM = 1.617] [p < 0.001; r = 0.75], session two and ses-\nsion four [M = 27.017; SEM = 2.058] [p = 0.002; r = 0.722], and between session three [M = 23.7; SEM = 1.895] \nand session six [M = 30.358; SEM = 2.229] [p = 0.001; r = 0.786].\nRegarding performance speed, the average time to grasp the marble decreased between the first session \n[M = 1,750 ms; SEM = 175] and final session [M = 690 ms; SEM = 87] [p < 0.001; r = −0.031] (Fig. 2B). In addi-\ntion, the average time to lift and drop the marble decreased between the first session [M = 748 ms; SEM = 99] and \nfinal session [M = 449 ms; SEM = 19] [p = 0.012; r = 0.063] (Fig. 2C). Finally, the average time to return to the \nbase of the cylinder after successfully dropping the marble also decreased between the first session [M = 1,006 ms; \nSEM = 59] and final session [M = 606 ms; SEM = 22] [p < 0.001; r = −0.060] (Fig. 2D).\nEye-Tracking Results: Visual Strategy Distribution. The initial GEE analysis examining the distribution of visual \nstrategies between the first and final training sessions revealed an interaction between visual strategy and train-\ning session [χ² = 5.015; p = 0.025] (Fig. 3A).

Regarding distance, the two-way repeated \nmeasures ANOV A examining the average vertical distance between the chopsticks and the fixation point during \nanticipatory visual strategies revealed a main effect of difficulty [F (1, 11) = 22.183; p = 0.001] with strategies \noccurring without the marble [M = 9.654; SEM = 0.454] displaying a greater vertical distance between the tool \nand the fixation point compared to strategies occurring while transporting the marble [M = 6.857; SEM = 0.278] \n[r = 0.275] (Fig. 6).

In addition, we were also interested in evaluating how changes in behavio-\nral performance were associated with changes in visual strategies. We confirmed that individuals continuously \nimproved their task performance through practice and that increased performance followed a logarithmic pat-\ntern, as evidenced by an overall effect of training on performance and significant increases over progressively \ngreater periods of time. Concerning the visual behavior, we predicted that confirmatory visual strategies would be \nmost prominent during the first training session, whereas anticipatory visual strategies would be most prominent \nduring the final training session. This prediction was also confirmed, as we observed a reversal in the distribution \nof anticipatory and confirmatory visual strategies after behavioral training. Next, we predicted that the aver -\nage vertical distance between the tool and the fixation during anticipatory visual strategies would increase after \ntraining. However, this prediction was not confirmed, as no significant differences in average vertical distance \nfor anticipatory strategies between the first and final training sessions were observed. Finally, our prediction that \nthe average duration of fixations for both anticipatory and confirmatory strategies would decrease after training \nwas confirmed for confirmatory strategies. However, there was no difference in average duration of fixations for \nanticipatory strategies. These results are next discussed in the context of the changes in behavioral performance \nand visual strategies observed in the study.\nBehavioral Performance. In order to determine whether the tool use motor learning paradigm we devel-\noped could be used to examine the acquisition of skilled tool use, the behavioral task needed to be simple enough \nthat participants could learn how to perform it but challenging enough that they did not maximize their per -\nformance after a single training session. While we did note a significant increase in performance after a single \ntraining session, performance continued to improve with practice. Specifically, performance increased between \nthe second and fourth sessions as well as between the third and sixth sessions (Fig. 2A). Considering the fit of the \nFigure 6. Anticipatory Strategy Vertical Distance – The average vertical distance for anticipatory strategies \noccurring without the marble was greater than anticipatory strategies occurring while transporting the marble. \nError bars indicate SEM. N = 12.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n9\nScientific  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:13755  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32001-4\nlogarithmic trend line to the data, additional practice would have likely revealed additional increases in perfor-\nmance, but these increases would become increasingly more difficult to achieve. Since the time scale for motor \nperformance improvements observed in the present study is congruent with the well-established logarithmic \ntime scale of performance improvements observed during motor learning\n14,15, we conclude that the paradigm \ndeveloped in this study is sufficient for examining the tool use motor learning process in a longitudinal fashion.\nVisual Strategy Distribution. In addition to assessing whether behavioral performance changes in a man-\nner reflective of traditional motor learning, we were also interested in examining whether visual strategies change \nthroughout the learning process as well. Indeed, we observed a reversal in the distribution of anticipatory and \nconfirmatory visual strategies as a function of training, with confirmatory strategies dominating the first training \nsession and anticipatory strategies dominating the final training session (Fig. 3A). As stated in the introduction, \nwhen one first learns to perform a novel motor task, the initial visual strategy is to focus on learning and exploring \nthe new spatial mapping between oneself and the novel object or environment\n22. In this study, that initial explor-\natory phase involved learning the sensorimotor constraints between the hand, the chopsticks, and the marble. \nOnce individuals became more familiar with the behavioral task and improved their performance through prac-\ntice, fewer cognitive resources were needed to explore the spatial relationship between the hand, the chopsticks, \nand the marble. As a result, predictive visual strategies intended to extract visual information about the tool’s \nfinal location became more prominent (Fig.  3A). This reversal in visual strategy distribution is congruent with \nprevious research examining how visual strategies change as one becomes more familiar with the task\n22. Indeed, \nwe also found that the percent of anticipatory strategies relative to the total number of fixations was positively \nassociated with behavioral performance during both the first training session (Fig. 3C) as well as the final training \nsession (Fig. 3D), a result consistent with previous findings regarding the positive association between anticipa-\ntory strategies and performance25,28,29.\nNext, we determined whether the reversal in visual strategy distribution was driven by an increase in the \nnumber of anticipatory strategies, a decrease in the number of confirmatory strategies, or a combination of both. \nWhile there was a decrease in the average number of confirmatory visual strategies per marble drop after train-\ning, there was no difference in the average number of anticipatory visual strategies per marble drop (Fig. 3B). \nThis finding isn’t necessarily surprising when one considers the nature of the task and the average number of \nanticipatory fixations per successful marble drop. That is, individuals had two movement goals during the task: \ntransport the marble to the apex of the cylinder and return the chopsticks to the base of the cylinder afterwards. If \nindividuals performed an anticipatory visual strategy to intake visual information about the final location of the \ntool, they should commit between one and two anticipatory fixations per successful marble drop. Regarding con-\nfirmatory visual strategies, individuals should commit fewer confirmatory fixations per successful marble drop \nas they become more familiar with the task and no longer need as much visual information about the interaction \nbetween the hand, the chopsticks, and the marble. While these findings are not necessarily unexpected, they do \nsuggest that the lower percentage of confirmatory visual strategies was driving increased performance rather \nthan the positive association with the percentage of anticipatory visual strategies. In other words, by committing \nfewer confirmatory fixations, individuals were able to enhance their speed and performance throughout practice.\nFinally, after decomposing strategies into those that occurred while transporting the marble to the cylinder \n(with marble) and those that occurred while returning the chopsticks to the base of the cylinder (without marble), \nresults showed that the distribution of visual strategies favored strategies occurring while transporting the marble \nmore so than strategies occurring without the marble (Fig. 4). This finding is unsurprising, as the most challeng-\ning aspect of the task was most likely to be maintaining one’s grasp on the marble. As a result, individuals would \nneed to alternate between anticipatory and confirmatory strategies so that they could maintain a proper grasp \non the marble by directing a fixation from the goal of the task to the interaction during movement and obtaining \nmore visual information.\nVisual Strategy Duration. Next, we also predicted that both anticipatory and confirmatory fixation dura-\ntions would decrease after behavioral training, suggesting that less visual information was necessary in order to \nmake an accurate movement. In contrast, we observed no main effect of training on fixation duration (Fig.  5). \nHowever, there was an overall decrease in the average duration of confirmatory fixations after behavioral training, \nsuggesting that although similar amounts of visual information were necessary during anticipatory fixations, \nindividuals no longer needed as much confirmatory information as they had previously needed when the task was \nstill unfamiliar. In addition, fixations occurring without the marble, particularly anticipatory strategies without \nthe marble, displayed a longer overall average duration compared to strategies occurring while transporting the \nmarble. Similar to the effect of difficulty seen in visual strategy distribution, the need to alternate between antic-\nipatory and confirmatory strategies to maintain a proper grasp on the marble likely resulted in each individual \nfixation being shorter in duration.\nAnticipatory Strategy Distance. In addition to assessing the general distribution and duration of antic-\nipatory and confirmatory visual strategies, we also predicted that the average vertical distance between the tool \nand the fixation during anticipatory visual strategies would increase after training. This prediction was based on \nprevious research indicating that visual information can be extracted from peripheral vision\n27. Specifically, we \nreasoned that if individuals were committing anticipatory visual strategies early in training, they might still be \nextracting visual information about the new spatial interaction between their hand, the chopsticks, and the mar-\nble. As a result, the average vertical distance between the fixation point and the chopsticks would be reduced com-\npared to the final training session. However, we observed no difference in average vertical distance of anticipatory \nvisual strategies between the first and final training sessions (Fig.  6). Instead, we found that the two movement \ngoals displayed different average vertical distances. That is, anticipatory strategies that occurred as the chopsticks \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n10\nScientific  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:13755  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32001-4\nwere returned to the base of the cylinder after a successful marble drop (without marble) displayed a greater aver-\nage vertical distance between the tool and fixation point than anticipatory strategies that occurred while trans-\nporting the marble to the apex of the cylinder (with marble). Considering that differences in task demands and \nsalience often result in different visual strategies\n32, the added difficulty and salience of holding the marble while \nmoving the chopsticks likely contributed to this difference. A primary principal that guides interactions between \nthe visual and motor system is that visual information is obtained in order to maximize motor accuracy and min-\nimize motor error\n33. In this case, in order to minimize error due to the increased difficulty of grasping the marble, \nit is possible that the vertical distance of anticipatory strategies was reduced so that peripheral vision could intake \nmore visual information about the status of the interaction between the tool and the marble.\nConclusions\nOverall, this study outlines a novel tool use motor learning paradigm involving a tool that is challenging to use \n(chopsticks) in order to perform a difficult task that one can continuously improve their performance through \npractice. We examined both behavioral performance and visual strategies in individuals who were naïve to the \nuse of chopsticks over the course of eight behavioral training sessions where they learned how to use chopsticks \nto perform the task. Our results indicate that this tool use motor learning paradigm was not too challenging that \nindividuals were unable to perform it but was difficult enough that extensive practice was required in order to \ndramatically improve one’s performance. In addition, our results demonstrate that the changes in visual strategies \nseen in traditional motor learning environments also occur when learning the present tool use task. Interestingly, \nwe found that changes in confirmatory visual strategies were more prominent than changes in anticipatory visual \nstrategies, suggesting that visual strategies become more efficient rather than more predictive throughout motor \nlearning. While future research may seek to further validate this tool use motor learning paradigm by determin-\ning how the acquired tool manipulation skills translate to unpracticed contexts, at present it represents a novel \nmethod for examining the tool use motor learning process in a longitudinal fashion.\nData Availability\nThe datasets generated during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable  \nrequest.\nReferences\n 1.
