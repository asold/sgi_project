Sulkowska \nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/45756 \n1. Introduction \n1.1. What kind of tool are isoenzymes \nA specific group of proteins – enzymes, char acterized by similar chemical properties are \nisoenzymes (Hunter & Markert, 1957, Tans kley & Orton, 1983, Goncharenko, 1988, \nMejnartowicz, 1990, Sułkowska, 1995). They are characterized by similar chemical, structural \nand catalytic properties almost identical within their functional group. They are \ncharacterized the same function in cell reacti ons, however they are products of different \ngenes (described as allozymes).  \nTheir origin is explained by gene duplication of polyploidisation mutation, which can create \nkinds of pseudogene – or nucleic acid hybrydis ation. Different forms of an enzyme that are \ncoded by variant alleles at the same locus ar e called allozymes, while isozymes are products \ncoded by genes located at different loci. Even  then, isozymes and allozymes are variants of \nthe same genes and they possess the same catalyti c functions they can be easily identified in \nbiochemical way. First of all the substitutions of different amino acids are responsible for \ntheir variant electric charge and this can be th e way how to identify them by electrophoresis \nprocess. This charge characteristics of isozym es and allozymes is the basis to use them as \nmolecular markers.  \nAn important feature of this group of proteins is that the presence of both alleles of a gene is \ndisclosed in a manner independent of each othe r so cold co-dominant character, so it is \npossible to request a degree of heterozygosity within the study population characteristics \n(Rider & Taylor, 1980). In practi ce, this means that there is a simple way to distinguish \nheterozygotes from homozygotes. The isoenzyme molecules are proteins. It is important to \ndefine them as the first products of gene tran slation, so they possess information about their \ncoding region of DNA. Their heredity of responsible genes is explained by Mendelian \n \nElectrophoresis 158 \ncharacter. A large number of genes encodi ng enzymes shows a significant degree of \npolymorphism. The process of natural selection is still important factor, because genes are \nspecialised to different functions.  \nLong time in forest sciences, the isoenzyme markers were the best tools to analyse genetic \nvariation of populations despite of the differ ent limits and restrictions of this method. \nNowadays we have more informative tools based on DNA markers such as sequencing, \nmicrosatellites, PCR-RFLP and single genes analysis like SNPs. Most of this DNA based \nmarkers is still developed to make them more suitable in analysis of plant organisms. The \nlevel of complication of plant genome is high er comparing to animal. Average of size of \nPinus genome is about 30 billion base pair (Grotkopp et al.,  2004). We have up to now many \npossibilities to analyse the polymorphism of DNA fragments of plant material but not the \nparticular genes. So, the isoenzyme markers repr esent still one of the best markers close to \nDNA level. It is possible to assess the variation of individuals at different level: within \nspecies, within population, and among populations within specie s. It is worth to add they \nare quick and cheap marker syst ems and good alternative to assay and identify level of \ngenetic variation as pilot study of popula tions (Bakshi & Könnert, 2011) as well as \nconservation biology activities e.g. gene bank  – enables choosing of proper sample for long \ntime conservation (Bednorz et al., 2006) or as well as in quantifying mating system analysis \n(Mrazikowa & Paule, 1990). \nThe proteins of enzyme are consisted of poly peptides and are molecules characterised the \nspecific conformation. The quaternary structure of particular enzyme forms may be different \nin relation to combination of peptides involved to build their molecules. We can observed \n(Figure 1) monomeric enzymes with two the same allozymes, dimeric forms with three \nallozymes and tetrameric proteins with fives allozymes. We can sometimes observe on gel \nafter electrophoresis bands of some intermediate mobility reaction. \nThe isoenzyme analysis method enables the assessment of variability of isoenzymes in \ndifferent types of tissues: young leaves, buds, pollen and seeds. There is possibilities to \nanalyse diploid as well as haploid tissue. Es pecially it is important, when we study \nconiferous species genetic variation, then it is great tool to analyse mating system of trees, \nbecause of possibilities of using haploid tissue of mother trees and diploid tissue of \nembryos. The analysis requires very small amou nts of plant material and is a very sensitive \nmethod. Simultaneously, it is possible to iden tify many samples/or individuals. The great \nadvantage of this method is low cost of chemicals used to performed the studies. \n1.2. Advantages of isoenzymes and week points of the utilisation \nThe using of isoenzyme electrophoresis method is useful tool especially in assessment of \ngene frequency of specific genes, determining of genetic similarities and genetic distances \nbetween the two objects e.g.: \n- Good tools to support conservation and management of forest trees genetic resources \n To characterize forest tree stands genetic structure \n \nIsoenzyme Analyses Tools Used Long Time in Forest Science 159 \n To asses initial gene pole \n To present selection processes of forest stands and to maintain rich of natural \ndiversity of stands \n- Genetic characteristics of different forest tree species reproductive material: \n Mother stands and progeny stands gene flow analysis \n Seed orchards and progeny plantations mating system \n The representation of populations selected fo r preservation in gene banks or in situ \nor ex situ measures \n- Solving of problems from seed stands management point of view:  \n clonal/pedigree identification/selection process \n pollen contamination especially important in  management of artificial tree stands \nlike forest seed plantations  \n patterns of gene flow and mating system in natural and artificial stands \n \nEnzyme/Gene Type Homozygote Heterozygote Homozygote \nMonomeric \n \n \n \nDimeric \n \n \n \nTetrameric \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. The graphic illustration of bands of proteins on the gel after electrophoresis process when we \nstudy various types of isoenzyme proteins.  \n1.3. Methodical problems \nThe isoenzyme studies are suitable only when  their heritability is explained by Mendelian \ncharacter – often the same enzyme systems are not suitable when we study different species. \nThe enzyme loci are not randomly distri buted over the genome, so they are not \nrepresentative for total genome variation (Hubby & Lewontin, 1966). We have problems to \ncompare analysed data with reference studies when the number of analysed enzyme system \nis different. At the first studies some enzyme  systems were described by different numbers \nenzyme gene loci systems e.g. peroxidases or number of loci controlling analysed enzyme. \nFor example GOT (transaminase glutamine oxylo- acetate) was assumed to be coded by 2 or \n\n \nElectrophoresis 160 \n3 or 5 gene loci for Scots pine (Müller-Starck et al., 1992). Some alleles are not identify as the \nbands on the gel (null alleles). It is not po ssible to use particular enzyme markers when \nlinkage disequilibrium is occurred for analysed loci, so it obvious to verify the genetic \ncontrol system and inheritance of chosen enzyme markers. \nStill seems to opened the question are allozyme neutral or adaptive?  \nSome researchers showed the results studies only for polymorphic enzyme systems without \nany information about monomorphic ones, so th e genetic variation was described as higher \nthan it was real. \nThe obtained information about isoenzyme variat ion is not a representative sample of the \ntotal variability of the analyzed species, wh ich illustrates the genetic variability within the \nranges of their occurrence, due to too small amount of tested samples. Evaluation of \nvariation by this method applies only to a very small part of the genome.  \n2. Methods \n2.1. The idea of isoenzyme electrophoresis \nThe charge characteristics of isoenzymes enable s to use them as genetic markers, which can \nbe distingished. First of all the substitutions of different amino acids are responsible for their \nvariant electric charge and this can be the way how to identify them by electrophoresis \nprocess. The identification of proteins molecule  characterised a specific electric charge can \nbe dissolved in a buffering solution, after ho mogenisation of plant or animal tissue. The \nnon-denatured proteins are separated on th e carrier gel and they migrate under the \ninfluence of an applied electric field. Th e molecules of enzyme proteins can change \nconformation shape and it will be followed by modification of net charge. This changes of \nmolecules charge can be detect using electrophoresis method. \nThe rate of migration of molecules in the gel and segregation of bands of enzymes in the gel \nis the result of interaction of: the applied el ectric field, pH of gel and electrode buffers \n(Concle et al., 1982). After completion of elec trophoresis on gel plate, the proteins are \nstained by using the appropriate staining reactions. \n2.2. Migration process of proteins in different media and their visualization \npossibilities \nThe carrier of proteins in electrophoresi s may be different types of substances: \npolyacrylamide gels and potato starch gels. The second one were historically used, but the \ngreat advantage of them still is the possibility of cutting them to obtain slices, which can be \nanalise to identify different protein markers using the same gel and tissue material, because \nall the proteins are active in the gel. \nProteins separated in the gel during electrophoresis can be detected by staining or UV \nanalysis e.g. fluorescent esterase enzyme. Methods of detection of enzymes are relatively \n \nIsoenzyme Analyses Tools Used Long Time in Forest Science 161 \nwell developed and reported in many publicat ions (Concle et al., 1982, Goncharenko, 1988, \nWang & Szmidt, 1989, Liengsiri et al., 1990). Th e visualisation of enzymes is possible by \nprecipitation of soluble indicators like tetrazolium salts using cofactors of NAD or NADP to \ntransfer them into reduced insoluble forms (Fig ure 2). It is important to put attention that \nthe staining reactions require the active fo rms of enzymes and they simulate work of \nproteins in functional tissues of organism s. Most of reactions are performed in the \ntemperature 37 °C. During relati vely short time one day of laboratory work we have result \nand evaluation of the analysis for about 50 samples e.g. individuals using 10 or more \nenzyme systems represented by on e or more loci each of them. It is important as well that \nthe staining process does not requires complic ated laboratory equipment. The resolving of \nproteins during electrophoresis can be performed in horizontal or vertical chambers, but the \ncrucial is to protect the activity of enzymes by providing of cooling system. The power of \nelectric field applied for migration of proteins is often up to 280V, so the heating of gel is \nobserved and have to be reduced. \n \n \nFigure 2. Menadione reductase electrophoretic pattern in European beech. We can observed The \nmonomeric enzyme form with two the same allozymes (homozygote form), dimeric form with three \nallozymes (heterozygote form) and tetrameric proteins with fives allozymes (heterozygote form). Photo \nM. Sulkowska \n2.3. Genetic differentiation evaluation process \n2.3.1. Analysed parameters to describe population genetic variation and differentiation \nThe basic parameters evaluated to measure population genetic variation and differentiation \nare usually as it follows: number of alleles per locus, heterozygosity ( H), percentage of \npolymorphic loci, genetic distance  (G ST). The terms of heterozygosity, diversity and \ndifferentiation are explained in different way by various researchers. Most of people used to \nwork with genetic parameters elaborated  by Nei (1973, 1978), when we consider \nheterozygosity observed or expected, what is  estimated as well as a measure of genetic \ndiversity heterozygosity observed ( Ho), heterozygosity expected ( He – or D – gene \ndiversity). The value of this parameter is calcul ated as values from zero (no heterozygosity) \nup to nearly 1.0 (when we observe a large number of nearly equally frequent alleles). \nInstead of average number of alleles per locus more precise used to be measure of effective \nnumber of alleles per locus (ne) – Crow & Kimura (1970). \n\n \nElectrophoresis 162 \n 2\n1\n1\nn\ni\nHe pi\n\n   (1) \n \n2\n1\n1\ne n\ni\nn\npi\n\n\n\n (2) \npi – frequency of n allele occurrence in population \nHeterozygosity is often one of the most im portant \"parameters\" when we describe the \ngenetic data. Using this measure we explain the general trends in the structure of \nanalysed populations – even is their history and future genetic structure is concerned. \nLow values of heterozygosity is influenced by small population size and processes of \ngenetic drift e.g. bottlenecks effect. A lot of heterozygotes in population is equal high \ngenetic variability and the opposite. When we compare the level of the observed and \nexpected heterozygosity in balanced popula tions concerning rand om and open mating \nsystem it means under Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium and heterozygosity is higher than \nexpected we can expect flow of alien pollen outside of population. If the observed \nheterozygosity is lower than expected we ca n assume that some inbreeding processes may \noccur in the population.  \nThe interpopulational variation is described very often as G\nST (Nei, 1973) and it is used as \nequivalent of F ST statistics (1969, 1978) and it enables  to asses for each population the \ndistance from other populations. \n TS\nST\nT\nHHG H\n  (3) \nHT - heterozygosity interpopulational \nHS - heterozygosity intrapopulational \n  IT T I TFH H H  (4) \nFST, cold as fixation index is the measure of pr oportion of the total genetic variance within \nsubpopulations in relative to the total genetic variance.

Software \nOne of the oldest programs enabling computin g of isoenzyme analysis data is BIOSYS-1. \nThis program was elaborated to help biochemical population geneticists to describe the \nanalysis of electrophoretically de tectable allelic variation. It can be utilised to study allele \nfrequencies and genetic vari ability measures, to test fo r deviation of genotype \nfrequencies from Hardy-Weinberg, expectations, to calculate F-statistics, to perform \nheterogeneity of chi-square analysis, to calculate a variety of similarity and distance \ncoefficients, and to construct dendrograms using among others cluster analysis \nprocedures. The program, documentation, and test data are available from the authors \n(Swofford & Selander, 1981). \nAnother one interesting software enabling as  well analysing of DNA data markers is \nPOPGENE (Yeh & Boyle, 1997). The current vers ion of POPGENE is designed specifically \nfor the analysis of co-dominant and dominant  markers using haploid and diploid data. It \nperforms most types of data analysis encounte red in population genetics and related fields. \nIt can be used to compute summary statistics, including: allele frequency: estimates gene \nfrequencies at each locus from raw data, effectiv e number of alleles per locus, percentage of \nall loci that are polymorphic, observed homozygosity, expected homozygosity, Shannon \nIndex, gene diversity Nei’s (1973), F-Statistics , Gene Flow: estimates gene flow from the \nestimate of GST or FST and many others parameters.  \nPOPGENE is a good tool in analysing and si mulations studies of population genetics, \nincluding: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, multip le allele and loci inheritance, natural \nselection, genetic drift, migration, mutation and inbreeding. \nApplied procedure of isoenzyme analysis is consisted of the following steps: \n Sample preparation (collecting of samples,  homogenization and extraction of proteins \nfrom the tissue) \n Preparation of gels and running buffers requirements regarding analysed enzyme \nsystems  \n Development of isoenzyme electrophoresis  \n Detection and staining of proteins  \n Computing of the obtained data base with utilisation of proper software \n3. Results \n3.1. Genetic variation characteristics \nThe investigations of beech variation and differe ntiation in Europe sh owed (Gömöry et al., \n2003, Sułkowska et al., 2012). The aim of this stud y was the assessment of genetic diversity \n \nElectrophoresis 164 \nand differentiation patterns of European beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.) populations within its \nnatural range in Poland and to compare them  to those in other ne ighbouring European \ncountries including Slovakia, the Czech Repub lic, Ukraine, and even Romania, which was \nreported previously (Paule et al. 1995). These stan ds cover 5.2% of the forest area in Poland, \nand form the predominant fore st tree communities throughout  the Carpathians and Sudety \nMountains, and the moraine landscape of the Pomeranian Lake District. Varying \nenvironmental conditions have resulted in a great number of ecotypes and populations \nwhich are characterised by va rious ecological requiremen ts. Poland represents the \nnortheastern limit of the beech’s natural dist ribution. Genetic diversity and differentiation \nwas assessed using allozyme gene markers employing 9 enzyme systems: glutamate-\noxaloacetate transaminase (GOT - EC 2.6.1.1) , leucine aminopeptidase  (LAP- EC 3.4.11.1), \nisocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH - EC 1.1.1.42),  malate dehydrogenase (MDH - EC 1.1.1.37), \nmenadione reductase (MNR - EC 1.6.99.2), phosphoglucomutase (PGM - EC 2.7.5.1), \nphosphoglucose isomerase (PGI - EC 5.3.1.9), peroxydase (P X - EC 1.11.17) and shikimate \ndehydrogenase (SKDH - EC 1.1.1. 25). The data revealed: high genetic diversity of beech, \nsimilar like in other neighboring European popu lations, slight decrease of average number \nof alleles per locus and level of differentiation towards the North of the natural range limit, \nwhich generally confirm the migration paths af ter glaciations but it is not the basis to \ndistinguish geographic regions.  \nThe population differentiation of beech prov enances of selected seed stands and their \nprogenies for chosen genetic parameters and on the basis of soil characteristics of the \nhabitats were studied (Sulkowska et al ., 2008, Sulkowska, 2010) . Beech populations \noccurring toward the northeast of the natural ra nge were characterised by a decreasing the \naverage number of alleles per locus and percentage of polymorphic loci. The highest genetic \ndifferentiation was found in the East Carpathians.  \n3.2. Ecotype variation characteristics  \n3.2.1. Geographic trends with an example of coniferous species - Scots Pine (Pinus \nsylvestris L.) \nAllozyme differentiation in chosen Eu ropean populations of Scots Pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) \nwere studied in 17 populations from No rth and East-Central Europe (Prus-G łowacki et al., \n1993). The samples were collected fr om provenance trial in Lubie ń (Poland). The \nprovenances from Scandinavia, northern Po land, Netherlands and Belgium were more \nheterozygotic, more polymorphic and characteri sed higher number of alleles per locus. The \nsource of seeds used to establish the provenance trial was unknown as far their \nautochthonous or introduced origin is concer ned, but the results indicate a degree of \ncoincident agreement with geog raphical distribution of stands. This effect seems to be \nblubbered by human activity (uncontrolled seed transfer).  \nThe studies of 11 enzyme systems concerned on the genetic variation of Pinus sylvestris from \nSpain in relation to other European popula tions revealed geneti c dissimilarity of \npopulations from this region. The differences were observed as far as slightly higher \n \nIsoenzyme Analyses Tools Used Long Time in Forest Science 165 \nnumber of alleles per locus, but lower heterozygosity level in populations from Spain (Prus-\nGłowacki & Stephan, 1994).  \nIn Poland, the isoenzyme studies of 5 systems variability of 8 populations revealed existence \nof two groups of populations – North and South groups (Krzakowa, 1979). There was a high \nvariability within all analysed loci. The im portance of existence of this groups was \nundertaken as well by field studies and low re gulations (Dz.U. 04, nr 67, poz. 621, 2004, \nMatras, 2005). \n3.2.2. Site plasticity with an example of deciduous species – European beech (Fagus \nsylvatica L. \nPresent genetic structure of beech population in Europe was formed many different factors \nnot only environmental and ge netic but also anthropogenic. Different environmental \ncondition resulted in great number of ecotype s and populations, that characterized various \necological requirements (Dzwonko, 1990, Gierty ch, 1990). Very important factors affected \nthe gene pool were glacial epoch and the locati on of beech refugia, for postglacial migration \npaths of species (Szafer, 1935, Huntley & Birk s, 1983, Ralska-Jasiewiczowa, 1983, Hazler et \nal., 1997). One of the first studies on genetic vari ability of isoenzymes of European beech - \nFagus sylvatica L. were conducted in France. The study of genes encoding peroxidase system. \nThere was a relationship between the frequenc ies of particular alleles encoding these \nenzymes, and analyzed population, geographic al and environmental fa ctors (Cugen et al., \n1985). Genetic variation of beech - Fagus sylvatica  L., was also analyzed on a wider scale \nwithin the six enzyme loci, 130 population for southern and western Europe. Observed \ncorrelation between the frequency of alleles of genes encoding peroxidase and climate \n(Comps, et al., 1990).  \nSome genotypes are eliminated during natural se lection process, when they are not efficient \nin the environment, it is shown using isoenzyme markers (Müller-Starck, 1985). In most case \npopulations characterised higher level of ge netic variation seems to be more tolerant to \nharmful environmental factors (Starke et al., 1996).  \nIn a continuous process of verifying the adaptation of individuals, which occurs in nature, it \nis contributed to both human and natural se lection. This was proven among other by \ndifferences in the genetic structure of two provenances of beech German and Romanian, \ngrown in a greenhouse and natural conditio ns (Kim, 1985). It was found that beech \nseedlings with Lap-A2 allele always were characterised a higher survival. Homozygous for \nthe allele Lap-A2 survived better in a greenhouse, while heterozygotes were characterized by \nhigher vitality in the natural environment. \n3.3. Using of isoenzyme markers in coniferous seed orchard research \nIsoenzyme markers are very important tool concer ning genetic parental or progeny identity \n(Wheeler & Jech, 1992). The estimation of gene flow in mating system of seed orchards is \ncrucial for proper use of seeds to asses and if  possible avoid pollen contamination outside of \n \nElectrophoresis 166 \nthe stands and seed orchard genetic efficiency. It plays important role for gene conservation of \nthe stands and the improvement in forest tree selection (Concle, 1972, Rudin & Lingren, 1977).  \nThe investigations of 122 trees in seed stan d in Sweden were conducted for adult trees, \nembryos of seeds and progeny of the stand (Yazdani et al., 1985). The analyses revealed \nsignificant variation among different groups of  studied objects at 5 enzyme loci. Genetic \nfrequencies of alleles were close to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, but the deviations were \nfound for embryos.  \nIn Poland, also featured on the study of  inheritance of a certain enzyme - GOT \n(transaminase glutamino-oxylo-acetate) for se lected two homozygous plus trees, under the \nterms of this gene, and the pollination of thes e trees by surrounding neighbors. The study \nprovided evidence of contamination at least 40% of the seeds with pollen outside the stands, \nwhich indicates a high out-crossing rate for pine (Krzakowa, 1980). \nIn the seed orchard in Slovakia, the mating system of trees was analysed on the basis of five \nenzymes studies inheritance (Mrazikowa & Paule, 1990). The study was conducted \nsimultaneously for macrogametophytes of embr yos and seeds. The degree of foreign seed \npollination with pollen from outside the plantation was shown. \n4. Discussion \nThe isoenzyme markers are important tool in when we assay gene variability of forest trees. \nThe complicity of genome of this organism makes it impossible in most cases to obtain \ninformation about particular genes. Nowada ys, molecular markers are powerful tools, \nwhich enables to study genetic variation of th e organism, but we are usually able to work \nwith specific fragments DNA, not to assa y the genes. The methods biochemical and \nmolecular should be taken into account in case of  genetic variability analyses of forest trees \nas complementary tools. It can be revealed by studies of migration paths of European beech \nusing both types of markers (Magri et. al., 2006), where existence of one common refugium \nof the species was proved for most part of Central and West Europe. \nSingle genes are responsible to control protein s of particular features – genetic traits \n(Bergmann, 1991). They are not responsible to control the complex of morphological traits, \nphysiological and adaptability of individuals as reaction of needs of environment, that are \ncrucial for surviving of rooted in one site plants over their whole life. \nEcotype variation of forest tree species can be classified as relation to their geographic range \n(Müller-Starck et al., 1992): \n Species characterised large geographic range like Scots pine, Norway spruce and \nEuropean beech and little genetic different iation among populations within regions \nderived from the same refugia, but greater comparing various refugia  \n Species with large geographic  ranges, but with many subspecies like Pine species – \nPinus nigra, Pinus halepensis with small interpopulational variation within subspecies, \nbut differentiation among subspecies \n \nIsoenzyme Analyses Tools Used Long Time in Forest Science 167 \n Species characterised small geographically ranges like fir but with great \ninterpopulational differentiation and medi um level of intrapopulational genetic \nvariation – endemic species \n Species with extremely small geographic ra nge like Siberian dwarf pine characterised \nrelatively high interpopulational differentiation – relic species. \nUsing of isoenzyme studies as one of DNA re sponsible marker to solve the problems of \nreproductive and economic valu e of seed orchard stands is very crucial (Wheeler & Jech, \n1992, Krzakowa, 1980). \nA especially interesting seems to be using of is oenzyme analysis in estimation of gene flow \nin natural and artificial populations of forest  trees, when the genetic values of artificial \nmanagement stands is taking into account (Savolainen & Yazdani, 1991, Skrøpa, 1994). The \nreported by authors genetic diversities as well the level of outcrossing rates estimated on the \nbasis of allozymes differentiation were co mparable in natural and artificial stands. \nHowever, that was underlined the importan ce of possible changes in the important \nquantitative traits not revealed by neutral enzyme markers. It was undertaken (Skrøpa, \n1994) the meaning of many aspects important for proper quality production of forest \nreproductive material e.g.: seed collection procedure, seedlings sylviculture management, \nprogeny testing.  \nLow costs of the analyses are the reason wh y isoenzyme markers are good tools in pilot \nstudies of gene pool, as well as conservation  biology activities e. g. gene bank – enables \nchoosing of proper sample for long time cons ervation. Using of isoenzyme analysis was the \nstep to assess the genetic variation for Sorbus torminalis L. Krantz. natural populations in \nPoland (Bednorz et al. 2006), what was the basis  to establish in the progeny stands in next \nstep, as ex-situ measures for the species.  \nThe present selection processes of forest st ands should to maintain richness of natural \ndiversity and do not allowed to use the trees with high economic as in of case natural \npopulations of Pinus wallichiana A.B. Jacks (Blue Pine) in India (Bakshi & Könnert 2011).  \n5. Conclusions \nThe isoenzyme molecules are proteins, which are defined as first product of the first \nproducts coding region of DNA activity. Their heredity is know n, when it is explained by \nMendelian character of segregation it is possible to utilise as genetic markers.  \nApplication of isoenzyme electrophoresis meth od is useful tool in forest trees genetic \ndiversity assessment, in spite of their long history of their utilization, elaboration of DNA \nanalysis markers as well as known limits of their possibilities to apply.  \nEspecially the possibilities to use them on wild scale, because of low costs of analysis makes \nthem important tools in: \n\n Genetic characteristics of different forest repr oductive material of natural and artificial \nstands e.g. \n \nElectrophoresis 168 \n- Mother stands and progeny stands gene flow \n- Seed orchards gene flow \n- Gene banks representation of populations assessment \n Solving of particular problems in case of:  \n- clonal/pedigree identification/selection process \n- pollen contamination \n- mating system \n- patterns of gene flow \n Good tools to support conservation and manage ment of forest genetic resources e.g. to \nsupport following activities: \n- identification of migration path of species from postglacial refugia \n- selection and protection of ecotypes \n- to asses initial gene pole for needs of effective gene conservation measures \n- to present selection processes of forest stands to maintain rich natural diversity. \nAuthor details \nMalgorzata K.
