These devices transfer \nenergy from one circuit to another by a common magnetic field. The \ntransmission of electric power along vast distances at low voltage is not \neconomically feasible because the losses are tremendous [1]. On the \nother hand, the power generation and consumption cannot happen \nat high voltages since they need pronounced insulation for safety \noperation. For that reason step-up transformers are needed to raise \nthe voltage after the generation for transmission and then step-down \ntransformers take the voltage to an appropriate distribution level [2]. \nThe power generation is usually obtained in a range from 11 to 33 kV , \nand then it is supplied to the transport network at 150, 220 or 400 \nkV in AC and 550, 800 kV on high voltage DC [3]. The consumption \noccurs typically at 230/420 V . The energy is transferred between \nthe low voltage and high voltage circuit by the magnetic induction \nprinciple. The majority of the transformers work in three-phase, so \nthey have 3 sets of 2 bobbins each that are lagged 120o from each other. \nThe winding coils can be assembled in different forms as represented \nin Figure 1. The wired winding coils are used in small distribution \ntransformers. Different solutions for winding coils are used in power \ntransformers applied at voltages from 15 to 765 kV and higher with \nratings stated in MV A. The power transformers have high short-circuit \nduties with a variable thermal loading that can be severe in some cases.\nThe variance in cost between of electrical transformers with copper \nversus aluminium conductors is now affecting the customer’s buying \ndecision. Thus, pending on the market cost of copper, the manufacturers \nof electrical transformers are replacing by aluminium several massive \nconductor components originally made of copper, as stated by \n*Corresponding Author: Dr. Pedro Vilaça, Department of Mechanical \nEngineering, School of Engineering, Aalto University, Finland; E-mail:  \npedro.vilaca@aalto.fi\nCitation: Vilaça P, Mendes J, Nascimento F, Quintino L  (2016) Application of \nFSW to Join Aluminium Foil Winding Coils for Electrical Transformers.

[4]. The lower conductivity of the aluminium ( 3.5 0 x107 S/m \nis the commonly used for high voltage power line) compared to copper\n( 5.96 x 10 7 S/m) does not means that the aluminium conductor \nwill run hotter than the copper conductor, but does means that \nthe aluminium conductor for the same ampere rating must have \na larger cross sectional area. When density of copper (8930 kg/m 3) \nis compared to the one of aluminium (2700 kg/m 3) and taking into \nconsideration the conductivity ratio of aluminium to copper, the result \nshows that on a per kg basis, aluminium has an amperage capability \nfrom 1.64 to 1.85 times higher than that of the copper. In according \nto Sullivan [5], even considering the less resistance of aluminium to \nthermal, chemical and mechanical loadings, and all the issues related \nwith the need of dissimilar joining with terminals made of copper, \nthe aluminium is nowadays a significant trend in the production of \nwinding coils for transformers in power systems.\nNow days, the main welding process applied to copper winding \ncoils is the GTAW (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding). This welding process \nis effective in welding the copper components, however, some defects \noccur when applied to aluminium, namely, porosity, hot cracking and \nnon-acceptable residual deformations. The prevention of distortion \nis an important requirement to avoid short-circuits between the \nmultiple turns of the windings with small gap distance. As emphasized \nby many authors, namely Golubev et al. [6] and Fehrenbacher et al. \n[7], the solid-state Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process is already a \nwell-established solution for welding aluminium alloys, resulting \nin low distortion joints. A comparison between the TIG with the \nFSW process in the joining of copper alloys was presented by Lin \net al. [8], confirming that the copper alloys joined by FSW presents \nbetter overall performance than welded by TIG. Lohwasser et al. [9] \nconsiders that aluminium alloys are particularly suitable for being \nsolid state welded because they are characterized mechanically \nby a relatively low flow stress in the viscoplastic zone, i.e. the zone \nundergoing temperatures above recrystallization temperature and \nbelow melting temperature of the material. Pépe et al. [10] concluded \nabout the fatigue and corrosion resistance benefits for AA5083-H111 \nof the zone under direct mechanical processing of the non-consumable \nFSW tool. This thermo mechanical processed zone undergoes a \nsevere thermo-physical cycle resulting in dynamic recrystallization \nand consequent grain refinement and homogeneous fine distribution \nof hardening particles. Leitão et al. conclude similar benefits for 1 \nmm thick aluminium plates [11], where the processed zone of the \naluminium alloys AA5182-H111 and AA6016-T4, presented benefits \nwhen compared with original condition. Several studies can be found \nin FSW of commercial pure aluminium thin sheets, namely the ones \npresented by Topic et al. [12], and Sato et al. [13], but none of these \nused a partially annealed temper condition, with low hardness, as the \none welded in the present application.\nThis paper describe the feasibility analysis of application of FSW \nto join aluminium foil winding coils towards a significant add-\nvalue application on the scope of the production of components for \nelectrical transformers. The FSW is applied to join residual bobbins of \naluminium sheet AA1070 with 1.6 mm thick and 1100 mm wide. In a \nsequential procedure, two residual foil winding coils are butt jointed \nby FSW and rewound in one new longer bobbin, until the total length \nalready enables its reutilization. Via this method, in the present tested \napplication, six residual foil winding coils were transformed into 2 \nnew foil winding coils each one gathering three original residual foil \nwinding coils. The development of the technological conditions and \nsupporting systems is depicted.\nMoreover, the mechanical and basic metallurgical and electrical \nfeatures are established for the preliminary experimental tests (Task \n1) and final implemented conditions (Task 2). \nRequirements for the FSW application\nThe requirements for the properties of the foil winding coils welded \nby FSW , focus on residual deformation and geometry, mechanical \nresistance and electrical resistance of the weld zone. The established \ncriteria were:\n1. The weld joint should be complete over all the original width of \nthe base material coils, because the magnetic fields around the \nside edges of the coils are particularly important; \n2. The residual deformation should be low, namely: a) No sharp \ngeometrical discontinuities along at the face and root of the \nweld joint; b) No thickness variation over  5 % of base material \nthickness; and c) No out-of-plan distortion over  5 % of base \nmaterial thickness; \n3. The maximum load capacity of the welded zone should not \nunder match the base material properties in tensile tests and \nbending tests. No special requirements for elongation and \ntoughness because the real loading condition is static bending \nwith no impact loads; \n4. The electrical conductivity in the weld zone should not be less \nthan  5 % of base material electrical conductivity. \nExperimental Conditions\n \nBase material \nThe base material was a technically pure aluminium AA1070 with \na chemical composition of 0.08 wt.%Si, 0.23 wt.% Fe, 0.01 wt.% Cu, \n0.004 wt.% Mn, 0.01 wt.% Mg, 0.004 wt.% Cr, 0.02 wt.% Zn, 0.01 \nwt.% Ti (all the contents are maximum limits) and 99.70 wt.% Al \n(minimum content). This material typically appropriate for electrical \nconductor components was supplied in the shape of laminated sheet \nwith thickness, t = 1.6 mm, and width, w = 1100 mm. The plates were \nstored in foil winding coils around a paperboard tube with internal \ndiameter, Ø\nint = 400 mm. Six residual foil winding coils were received \nat the welding laboratory, with weights ranging from 200 to 300 kg.\nThe Figure 2 shows the original foil winding coils as received at \nwelding laboratory and the metallographic analysis of the base \nmaterial cold rolled and partially annealed foil in the as-received \ncondition. This sample has been prepared according to the procedure \ndescribed below, and etched with Poulton reagent to reveal grain \nboundaries. The anisotropic structure, originated by cold rolling \noperation, does not show evidence of any presence of precipitates and \nsecond phase particles.\nCitation: Vilaça P , Mendes J, Nascimento F , Quintino L  (2016) Application of FSW to Join Aluminium Foil Winding Coils for Electrical Transformers.

An average of 3 specimens extracted along the \nrolling direction was calculated. The values obtained are depicted in \nTable 1 for the tensile resistance properties, namely, Y oung modulus \n(E), yield strength (σ\n02), ultimate strength (σu), specific toughness (ET) \nand elongation at fracture (ε).\nThe values presented in Table 2 for the bending resistance properties \ndepict the maximum force during test (Fmax), displacement of puncher \nat maximum force (D max) and energy applied until maximum force \n(En). \nThe hardness of the base material was tested, with 2 sets of 9 points, \nand the average was BMHARD = 27.9 HV02. \nPlan for joining the foil winding coils\nThe FSW joints were performed in 2 sequential tasks, represented \nin Figure 3, and described below:\nTask 1) Preliminary test trials to develop the FSW process \nparameters and technological conditions were performed on 300 mm \nlong welds. This length already includes the all initial and end zones \nwith transient conditions and a stationary zone at the middle of the \nweld joint. These tests were performed in the original table of the \nFSW equipment. During these preliminary tests the best set of FSW \nprocess parameters and tool features are developed and selected for \nimplementation in real conditions of Task 2; \nTask 2) Final tests in conditions similar to the real industrial \napplication conditions. For this purpose a new dedicated supporting \nand clamping system was designed to test the welding and rewinding \nof the foil winding coils in real dimensions. The new dedicated \nsupporting and clamping system was built only to assess the feasibility\nof this application of FSW . Thereof, to minimize the cost, the design \nwas based on a hybrid structure made of wood (for the overall \nstructure), steel (to support with high stability the load and dynamics \nduring the FSW process) and copper (as cool backing anvil).\nAll the welds were performed in the direction transversal to the \nrolling direction of the aluminium foil. During Task 2 the plan for \njoining the original residual foil winding coils is presented in Figure \n4. For each welding pair of foil winding coils the heaviest coil before \njoining was positioned in the back bobbin support. This criteria are \ndue to the fact that back bobbin support was designed to be stronger \nthan the front support of the foil winding coils. Therefore, the \nrewinding direction after joining by FSW was always oriented into \nthe back bobbin support.\nFSW Equipment and Tools\nThe FSW equipment applied is an ESAB LEGIO 3UL. This \nequipment enables vertical downward force control of the FSW tool \nrelatively to the workpieces, and online capacity of computational \nmonitoring of all the welding parameters, including force, torque, \nposition and speed in all the axis (the monitoring and records were \ndone with 10 Hz).\nThe FSW tool geometric features of the probe and shoulder are the \nmain process parameters.

The run-on and \nrun-off tabs were extracted from the base material of the foil winding \ncoils, with about 100 mm x 100 mm.

The vertical \nforging force at start and end of the welds was reduced, from the \nprescribed value for the stationary regime, for best stability of the \nprocess, mainly regarding the stable transition from the run-on tab \ninto the base material and from the base material into the run-off tab.\nExperimental Conditions\nAll samples for metallographic analysis were prepared by cutting \nwelded material orthogonal to welding direction. For primary \ngrinding, SiC papers of 600 to 4000 grit were used. The samples were \nthen finalized via OPS solution. Between all the steps the surface \ncleaned with ultrasound, with the samples immersed in alcohol for a \nminimum period of 5 minutes.

Therefore, the cost of material and manufacturing was \nminimized. The overall structural system is represented in Figure 6.\nDue to geometrical constrains of the welding equipment, all \nthe structural system have to be positioned at the front side of the \nFSW LEGIO equipment. The structural system was divided in 2 \nsub-systems: a) Structure to support the 2 foil winding coils during \nwelding and rewind between the coils; and b) Table to clamp the \nsheets in a butt joint configuration during FSW .\nSubstructure: support and rewind the coils\nThe structure to support the two foil winding coils during welding, \nand rewind between the coils after the welding, was designed in \naccording to the following requirements:\nInt J Mech Syst Eng                                                                                                                                                                                                IJMSE, an open access journal                                                                                                                                          \n ISSN: 2455-7412                                                                                                                                                                                                    Volume 2. 2016. 115                                           \nCitation: Vilaça P , Mendes J, Nascimento F , Quintino L  (2016) Application of FSW to Join Aluminium Foil Winding Coils for Electrical Transformers.

Thus, Tool 2 with a small tilt angle of 0.5 degrees was \nselected for final welds. Figure 9 depicts the results obtained for the \ntensile tests, where it is possible to conclude that Tool 1 presented a \npremature failure at the middle of the weld.\nFrom the results of Figure 9, it is possible to verify that the FSW \n2 set of parameters, presented in Table 4, resulted in no loos of \nmechanical strength of the weld specimens, which was established \nas the requirement number 3 for the properties of the foil winding \nFigure 8: Details of the structural system for clamp and guide the foil winding coils for FSW , emphasizing the anvil made of technically pure copper.\nFigure 9: Tensile tests results of tested welded specimens relative to base material, from Task 1: a) Results of best set of parameters with Tool 1 (FSW#1) \nand Tool 2 (FSW#2); b) Fracture location of FSW with Tool 1; c) Fracture location of FSW with Tool 2.\ncoils welded by FSW . The loss of elongation is not significant (less than \n30 %) and was not among the requirements because the real loading \ncondition is static bending with no impact loads.\nVisual analysis\nAll the face surfaces of the welds, i.e. the surface side in contact with \nthe shoulder of the FSW tool, were analysed focusing regularity of \nstriates and width of the weld bead. The root surface of the welds were \nanalysed focusing the evidence of penetration level and regularity. \nOnly perfect results, concerning these features, were accepted for all \nthe welds implemented between the aluminium foils. An evidence \nof the benefit in applying the FSW to join these winding foils is the \ncontrol of residual deformation. Figure 10 depicts the difference in \nangular distortion from applying the GTAW and FSW to the Task 1 \nwelded samples with about 300 mm (length) x 100 mm (width).\nContrasting with the planar samples welded by FSW , the samples \nwelded by GTAW present an angular distortion of about 13o (Figure \n10c). The low distortion level of the FSW welds are in according to \nthe requirement number 2 for the properties of the foil winding coils \nwelded by FSW .\nInt J Mech Syst Eng                                                                                                                                                                                                IJMSE, an open access journal                                                                                                                                          \n ISSN: 2455-7412                                                                                                                                                                                                    Volume 2. 2016. 115                                           \nCitation: Vilaça P , Mendes J, Nascimento F , Quintino L  (2016) Application of FSW to Join Aluminium Foil Winding Coils for Electrical Transformers.

This fact justifies the reason why in \nspecimens from sound FSW beads the fracture during tensile tests \ndoes not occur in the processed zone but well inside the base material. \nThus, it is possible to conclude that the processed zone by FSW shields \nthe weld bead from fracture under tensile loading.\nBending tests\nThe mechanical resistance of the welded specimens under bending \nload is present in Figure 12. This test is one of the highest demanding \nfor FSW specimens. In fact, any lack of complete penetration, one \nof the most prone to happen defects in conventional FSW , is easily \nexposed under this type of loading. The Figure 12 presents results for \nspecimens extracted from the start zone, middle zone and end zone \nof the 1100 mm long weld bead. In the middle section, results are also \npresented for smoothed face surface and root surface, to investigate \neventual benefit in post-weld grinding any of the welded surfaces.\nFrom the results of Figure 12, it is possible to verify a benefit of \nabout 20% relatively to base material in terms of maximum bending \nthat the welded coils are able to support. This result overcome the \nminimum condition established as the requirement number 3 for the \nproperties of the foil winding coils welded by FSW . The elongation at \nmaximum bending load is reduced from base material properties. The \nresults in the three different zones are similar. In addition, the results\nFigure 10: Evaluation of angular distortion during preliminary weld \ntests with FSW and GTAW: a) FSW welded specimen; b) GTAW welded \nspecimen.\nFigure 11: Hardness distribution in the FSW specimens with parameters \nimplemented in production.\nFigure 12: Bending tests results for base material, and start zone, middle zone and end zone of the 1100 mm long weld bead. Tests with face surface in-\ntensile and root surface in-tensile are implemented in the specimens from all the zones.\nfor face surface in tensile and root surface in tensile are similar for \nall the welded zones. There is no evident benefit in polishing any of \nthe weld surfaces (face or root surface). This result means that the \nmaximum productivity condition corresponds to the maximum \nmechanical resistance reached.\nMetallographic analysis\nThe Figure 13 depicts some of the metallurgical features of the FSW \nbead.\nIn the macrograph (2.5x) it is possible to distinct the thermo-\nmechanically affected zone (TMAZ) with the central dynamically \nrecrystallized small grain sub-zone, the nugget, as characterized by \nVilaça et al. [15]. The TMAZ different properties were distinguishable \nin the hardness test (Figure 11). The zone adjacent to the TMAZ \ncorresponds to the heat affected zone (HAZ). The distinct small grain \nsize and thermomechanical processing energy accumulated within \nthe TMAZ zone is the origin of the mechanical strength matching in \ntensile load tests and overmatching in bending load tests.\nElectrical conductivity\nThe laboratorial apparatus applied during the analysis of the local \nelectrical conductivity on the vicinity of the FSW processed zone is \npresent in Figure14.\nThe results express the very low impact of the FSW weld beads on \nthe conductivity of the aluminium winding coils. The decay from the \nbase material electrical conductivity (63.7 % IACS) is less than 4 %. \nThe reduction is due to the substantial reduction of the grain size \ninside the TMAZ of the weld bead as concluded by Santos et al. [16]. \nThe small loss of conductivity in the weld zone is within the limits \nestablished in the requirement number 4 for the properties of the foil \nwinding coils welded by FSW .\nConclusion\nThe most significant observations from the present study are the \nfollowing:\nInt J Mech Syst Eng                                                                                                                                                                                                IJMSE, an open access journal                                                                                                                                          \n ISSN: 2455-7412                                                                                                                                                                                                    Volume 2. 2016. 115                                           \nCitation: Vilaça P , Mendes J, Nascimento F , Quintino L  (2016) Application of FSW to Join Aluminium Foil Winding Coils for Electrical Transformers.
