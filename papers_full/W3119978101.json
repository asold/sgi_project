This ability is present \never since infancy and most theories indicate that children become proficient with tool use very early. \nIn adults, tool use has been shown to plastically modify metric aspects of the arm representation, \nas indexed by changes in movement kinematics. To date, whether and when the plastic capability \nof updating the body representation develops during childhood remains unknown. This question is \nparticularly important since body representation plasticity could be impacted by the fact that the \nhuman body takes years to achieve a stable metric configuration. Here we assessed the kinematics \nof 90 young participants (8–21 years old) required to reach for an object before and after tool use, \nas a function of their pubertal development. Results revealed that tool incorporation, as indexed by \nthe adult typical kinematic pattern, develops very slowly and displays a u-shaped developmental \ntrajectory. From early to mid puberty, the changes in kinematics following tool use seem to reflect a \nshortened arm representation, opposite to what was previously reported in adults. This pattern starts \nreversing after mid puberty, which is characterized by the lack of any kinematics change following \ntool use. The typical adult-like pattern emerges only at late puberty, when body size is stable. These \nfindings reveal the complex dynamics of tool incorporation across development, possibly indexing the \ntransition from a vision-based to a proprioception-based body representation plasticity.\nTo efficiently control our actions, whether performed with our hands or handheld tools, the brain needs to \nencode, update and store properties of the effector, including its size and shape, as well as its location. This “state \nof the body” is combined with the “state of the world” (e.g., the object to grasp) to build an appropriate motor \n plan1–3. The body state representation, also known as body schema, is highly plastic. Several studies converged in \nshowing that using a tool modifies the effector representation, as indexed by changes in the kinematics of subse-\nquent free-hand movements. Typically, after using a 40 cm long mechanical grabber, adult participants (in their \nmid-twenties) display longer latencies and smaller peaks in the reaching phase of their hand  movements4–8. In \nother words, after tool use, participants move as if their arm is  longer8 and these changes in their kinematics have \nbeen taken as a motor signature of tool incorporation. In adults, this plasticity is fast: a few minutes of tool use are \nenough to update the arm representation, making these changes in motor control observable (see, for  review9–12).\nFrom a developmental perspective, research agrees that humans are tool-users since their  infancy13–16. Per-\ncussive hammering for instance seems to develop from infants’ own manual behaviour to allow proper use of a \nhammer by 3 years of age, distinguishing young children from nonhuman  primates17–19. The ability to use a rake \nhas been observed in infants around 18 months: in presence of a distant toy, they successfully use the rake to \nretrieve the toy by learning from their errors and adults’  demonstration20–22. Progression in such ability would be \nclosely linked to improvement in vision, tool use following the perception–action loop similarly as any manual \n action23–25. Improvement in motor capabilities such as perception of affordances would tune improvement in \nOPEN\n1Laboratoire Dynamique Du Langage, CNRS UMR5596, Lyon, France. 2University of Lyon II, Lyon, \nFrance. 3Integrative Multisensory Perception Action and Cognition Team - ImpAct, Lyon Neuroscience Research \nCenter, INSERM U1028, CNRS U5292, Lyon, France. 4University UCBL Lyon 1, University of Lyon, Villeurbanne, \nFrance. 5Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy. 6Hospices Civils de Lyon, \nMouvement Et Handicap and Neuro-Immersion, Lyon, France. 7Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University \nof Trento, Trento, Italy. 8Present address: Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London, Egham \nHill, Surrey, Egham TW20 0EX, UK. 9These authors contributed equally: Alessandro Farnè and Alice Catherine \nRoy. *email: mf.martel90@gmail.com\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ntool  use26,27, thus being tightly associated with multisensory integration. Later on, children become proficient \ntool users: by 6 years of age they can make reliable reachability judgements either with their arm or with a \n tool28–31, similarly to  adults32. However, the developmental trajectory of the plastic capability of incorporating \ntools remains unknown and no study has tested whether tool use modifies the effector representation in children. \nThis question is particularly important when considering that the human body and its representation undergo \nenormous changes, taking years to achieve a stable metric  configuration33,34.\nHow does body representation deal with body growth to achieve skilful motor control? Besides the need to \ntake their growing body size into account, children face the challenge of a developing multisensory integration, \nwith immature use and weighting of vision and proprioception for instance, and immature motor control during \nthe first decade of their life (e.g. 35–45). Updating the body representation with the increasing metric of effectors \nimplies extracting their current estimated size and weight, especially challenging during adolescence, a period of \ncritical changes in body morphology. Indeed, while the rate of growth changes is almost constant during child-\nhood and thus possibly simpler to cope with, it increases sharply during the growth spurt, a developmental stage \nusually related to a transitory clumsiness (46 but  see47). As the brain computes current “state of the body” when \nprogramming a  movement2, one could argue that estimates are more accurate in the case of a constant rate of \ngrowth, while growth spurt would be more difficult to track, particularly given multisensory integration is still \nunder development. Velocity in physical growth has been shown, indeed, to be negatively correlated to motor \n competence48. For instance, 8-year-old children can optimally integrate visual and proprioceptive cues to localize \ntheir hand during  movement49,50. Older children though, around 12 years old, display impoverished integrative \nperformance, this decreased ability being attributed to the beginning of  puberty49. In the same vein, Visser and \n Geuze51 observed that kinesthetic acuity improves from the age of 5–12 and from 14 to 16, but not from 11.5 \nto 14, in correspondence to the beginning of the adolescence growth spurt. In addition, temporary changes in \nproprioceptive integration have been highlighted in upper limb postural control. Anticipatory postural adjust-\nments require a maturation period, similarly to voluntary  control43, not being fully achieved before 8 years of \n age52–55. Interestingly, 11–16 years old adolescents do no perform better than younger  kids56, actually failing to \nuse proprioceptive information to improve their postural  control57. These findings suggested that “adolescence \nmight constitute a transient period of proprioceptive neglect in sensory integration of postural control”57,58. Thus, \ngrowth spurt may impact proprioceptive integration, which is necessary both for appropriate postural control \nof the upper  limb35 and for tool use plastic changes in kinematics to  manifest8,59.\nIs tool-induced body representation plasticity present in children as it is in adults? If adolescence is a critical \nnode in the developmental trajectory for the refinement of skillful motor control of the arms (slow plasticity), it \nmight be so also when considering the plastic changes in kinematics induced by tool use (fast plasticity). To test \nthis hypothesis, here we used a tool-use paradigm, well-established in adults, to investigate the developmental \ntrajectory of tool-induced body representation plasticity in 90 participants (7.5- to 21.5-year-old) as a func-\ntion of their adolescence (puberty score). The typical adult pattern (participants in their mid-twenties) shows \nincreased latencies and reduced amplitudes of free-hand movements after tool  use5,8. Here, we investigated if \nand when this pattern is observable in children, adolescents and young adults, contrasting two predictions: if \ntool use incorporation embraces the growing body dimensions smoothly, we should find the motor signature \nof tool use throughout the tested period. Alternatively, if growing spurt alters this ability, as suggested by the \nliterature reviewed above, we should not observe the typical kinematics changes after tool use thorough all the \ndevelopmental steps, and they should be particularly absent during adolescence.\nMaterial and methods\nParticipants. Ninety typically developing children, adolescents and young adults (44 males; 6 left handed \naccording to the Edinburgh  inventory60; mean age ± SD: 13.95 ± 3.64; range: 7.5–21.5) were recruited from dif-\nferent local schools and universities to participate in this study. Data collection stopped at the end of the school \nyear. Minimal age of recruitment was 7 years, to ensure that all participants would be able to anticipate the action \ngoal in a similar  fashion43. As for the maximal age, we enrolled the youngest participants possible who scored \n20/20 at the puberty questionnaire (see below), which lead to recruit beyond 18 years old. Table  1 summarizes \ndemographic data for each puberty score. All participants (their parents or guardians if under 18 years of age) \ngave written informed consent to participate to the study, which was approved by the French ethics committee \n(Comité de Protection des Personnes CPP Sud-Est II) and conformed to the Helsinki declaration. All were naïve to \nthe purpose of the study, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, with no known neurological disorders, \nlearning disabilities or delayed psychomotor acquisition according to their own report, or their parents’ one for \nthe underage participants. None of the participants was born preterm. After completion of the tasks, each adult \nparticipant received a monetary compensation, while children and adolescents received a board game.\nApparatus and procedures. To account for changes in arm motor control induced by tool use, we used \na well-established  paradigm5,8,11: free-hand reach-to-grasp movements are performed before and after reach-\nto-grasp tool movements. The kinematics of free-hand movements are then compared (pre-post) to assess the \nconsequences of tool use on free-hand movements. As a control for the specificity of tool use effects on body rep-\nresentation for action (body schema), participants performed the Arm Length Estimation task, which assesses \nthe explicit, subjective estimate of the arm length (body image), typically left unchanged in  adults8. Participants \nwere comfortably seated in front of a table, on an adjustable chair, their dominant hand closed in a pinch-shaped \ngrip on a starting switch. The target object was a wooden parallelepiped (10 × 2, 5 × 5 cm, weighting 96 g) placed \non the table at a distance of 35 cm along the sagittal axis, in line with participants’ right shoulder (or left shoulder \nfor left-handed participants). Importantly, as in previous studies using the same  paradigm4–8, the target object \nwas always located inside the arm reaching space, thus preventing the potential confounding effects of tool use \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nin different sectors of space (reachable vs. non-reachable space). Once reached a comfortable position, the chair \nwas fixed to keep the distance from the table constant, but could rotate to adapt to the different tasks.\nThe experiment was composed of three sessions: a pre- and post-tool use session, separated by a tool use \nsession (Fig. 1).\nThe pre and post tool-use sessions included the two tasks (Free-Hand Movement and Arm Length Estima -\ntion), counterbalanced across participants. In the Free-Hand Movement task (18 trials), participants had to reach, \ngrasp and lift an object with their dominant hand, at their natural speed. Then, participants put the object down \nand brought their hand back to the starting position on the switch, waiting for an auditory signal to start the next \ntrial. The reaching component of the movement was characterized by the kinematic parameters of the wrist, while \nthe grip component was characterized by the thumb and index displacement. For each movement, the following \nkinematic parameters were extracted and analysed off-line: latencies and amplitudes of wrist acceleration, wrist \nvelocity and wrist deceleration (reaching component), latency and amplitude of the maximum thumb-index \ndistance (hereafter MGA for Maximum Grip Aperture) (grasping component). For each movement we measured \nthe overall movement time as the time between the beginning of the movement (velocity ≥ 10 mm/s after switch \nrelease) and stabilized grasp on the object (before any lifting). In the Arm Length Estimation task (18 trials), \nparticipants were blindfolded and had to slide their dominant index finger horizontally on the surface of the table \nfrom the starting position to a final point for a distance they estimated to be equal to the distance between their \nTable 1.

Extracted parameters were the same as in the Free-Hand Movement \ntask, except that they involved kinematics of the tool instead of the hand (see section Kinematic Recording System \nfor details on the markers position). The tool was based on a commercial grabber (Unger Enterprise Inc, CT, \nUSA; Fig. 1) with an ergonomic handle fitted with a lever, a long rigid shaft, and a “hand” with two articulated \nfingers. We customised three different tools, scaling them according to the children’s height. To prevent focus-\ning attention on participants’ arm length, potentially biasing the explicit estimation task, we first determined \nthe ratio between tool length and arm length from the above-cited studies in adults (that is the tool is usually \n1.5 times longer than adults’ actual forearm length). Then, we used data from our previous and ongoing studies \non children to calculate the relationship between arm length and height in younger participants. Note that also \nin this study, participants’ height and forearm length strongly correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.89; p < 0.001). Finally, \nwe determined the three best tool lengths to fit children on our period of interest. This was to ensure that the \nmanipulated tool would fit the participants’ body size. As a result, the big tool was 40 cm long, similarly to the \none we used on previous  studies4–6,8, except that it was 100 g lighter to prevent fatigue in the younger adoles-\ncents; it was used for the young adults and the adolescents who were taller than 147 cm (66 participants; range \nfrom 9.2 to 21.5 years old). The middle one, for children between 123 and 146 cm of height, was 32 cm long (23 \nparticipants; range from 7.6 to 11.9 years old). The small one was used for the only child under 122 cm (age 7.5) \nand was 25 cm long. A summary of this can be found in Table 1.\nGesture imitation proficiency and puberty level assessment.  Before or after the kinematic part of \nthe study (randomized), participants performed a modified version of a gesture imitation task, initially devel-\noped for the assessment of  apraxia61: they used their dominant arm to imitate the movement performed by \nthe experimenter using the same arm as the participant (anatomical imitation; note that in the original task, \nimitation was mirrored). Two examples were first used to familiarize them with the task, and to emphasize \nthe importance of doing the exact same gesture (fingers opening, hand orientation and so on), and that some \ngestures would be repeated. Instructions were repeated several times before the test. There were 24 items: par -\nticipants scored 3 points if they imitated correctly the first time, 2 points if the experimenter had to show them \nthe movement a second time. At the third and last repetition, participants had 1 for a correct gesture and 0 for \na wrong one. Assessment criteria were similar to those classically used in motor imitation  tasks62. Specifically, \nthe criteria included the arm or/and hand configuration (extended arm and fist configuration for example), \nthe limb orientation in space (e.g. palm down), its target location (e.g. palm on the contralateral shoulder). For \nsequential gestures, an additional criterion was the correct order and number of occurrence (e.g. three repeti-\ntions of fist and hand flat on the table sequence). Any differing element from one of these criteria was considered \nas an incorrect imitation. The maximum score was 72. The same, trained experimenter demonstrated the gesture \nand evaluated online the imitation for all the participants. The rationale behind using this task was to quantify \nparticipants’ visuomotor proficiency and to assess whether puberty and growth spurt in particular could affect \nit, as it has been reported  elsewhere46,51.\nParticipants’ height, weight, as well as arm and forearm lengths were measured after the experimental session. \nTheir pubertal development stage was assessed through the Self-Rating Scale for Pubertal  Development63, an \nadapted version of a previous interview-based puberty  scale64. Scores on each of the five items (growth spurt, \nbody hair, skin changes, deepening of the voice/breast growth and growth of hair on the face/menstruations) \nwere added to obtain a global Puberty Score (PS/20). For each item, participants could indicate that the phe-\nnomenon had not started yet (hereafter pre puberty), had barely started (early puberty), was definitely underway \n(mid puberty), or was finished (late puberty). Table  1 summarises, for each puberty score, the participants’ \ncharacteristics.\nKinematic recording system. Similar to previous studies using this  paradigm4–8, we placed infrared light \nemitting diodes (IREDs) on three different locations on the participants’ dominant hand: the medial lower cor-\nner of the thumb nail, the lateral lower corner of the index finger nail and on the skin proximal to the styloid \nprocess of the radius at the wrist. Three more IREDs were located on the tool: on its “fingers” and on the distal \npart of the shaft (“wrist”). Spatial localization of the markers was recorded with an Optotrak 3020 (Northern \nDigital Inc; sampling rate: 200 Hz; 3D resolution: 0.01 mm at 2.25 m distance).\nStatistics. We used the same statistical approach for each task: using mixed models, we modelled the \nchanges in the parameters with a fixed factor (PRE/POST or FIRST/LAST BLOCK) and the continuous Puberty \nScore (see following sections for equations in each model). This allowed to investigate how using a tool could \nchange the kinematic pattern, and how it could do it differently depending on the puberty level. For this last \nreason, presence of interaction between Puberty Score and the fixed factor was particularly relevant. Since age \nand puberty are highly correlated and our scope is not to disentangle their respective role, we preferred using \nthe puberty score to have an individual accurate estimation of body growth and indirectly account for the effect \nof sex. Indeed, the same level of puberty (hence growth spurt) is typically attained at different ages in boys and \n girls65 and within-sex differences have long been  known66, as confirmed in our dataset; for instance, a boy aged \n5\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n13.8 years had barely started his puberty (scoring 7/20 on the puberty scale), while a boy aged 13.2 years was in \nthe middle of his growth spurt (scoring 12/20). Due to this complexity, we can expect a non-linear relationship \nbetween puberty score and parameters (i.e. the dependent variable). For this reason, we allow the relationship to \nbe quadratic (polynomial of degree 2) or linear.\nAs we are in a multivariate setting (9 kinematic parameters per task) and each parameter may be associated \nto a slightly different pattern (i.e. not all the parameters might be significantly affected), we first summarized the \n9 kinematic parameters trough an ordination method, namely the Principal Component Analysis for both the \nfree-hand and tool-use movements. We computed the first principal component through a spectral decomposi-\ntion of the correlation matrix of the 9 parameters (the use of the correlation instead of the covariance matrix \nis advocated by the need for a principal component that does not depend on the unit of measurement of the \nparameters). Then the scores of the first principal component is taken as a new meta-parameter (i.e. dependent \nvariable) on the quadratic/linear model for hand/tool movement. By allowing a quadratic polynomial relationship \nbetween puberty and the meta-parameter, we add flexibility to the fit, while the linear model uses less degrees of \nfreedom and provides more accurate estimates if the underlying model is truly linear. For each task, we decided \nbetween the linear vs. the polynomial through a goodness of fit test (based on the likelihood ratio of the two \nmodels). The polynomial/linear fit was used accordingly for all the parameters of the task. The fit of the model \nfor the meta-parameter allows for a multivariate analysis and the significance on a coefficient can be interpret \nas an overall evaluation among the 9 parameters. We thus additionally distinguished the reaching (latency and \namplitude of wrist/tool acceleration, velocity and deceleration) and the grasping component (maximum grip \naperture and its latency) and computed a global p-value for each component. We report the percentage of vari-\nance explained by the first component of the analysis: higher is this percentage, better the results of the model \nsummarize the multiple parameters (there is no minimum threshold of the captured variance percentage, but \nwe consider that explaining at least 50% of the total variance – from multiple parameters – with a single meta-\nparameter is a good result).\nFree‑hand movement. The model based on the principal component analysis was better fitted with a quadratic \ncurve than a linear one (χ2(2) = 7.28; p = 0.026). We thus used a polynomial fit for each kinematic parameter of \nthe free-hand movement. Based on our hypotheses mentioned in the introduction, we analysed the kinematic \nfeatures of free-hand movements performed after tool use as a function of participants’ adolescence level, as \nindexed by their puberty score, in order to look for the adult pattern of kinematic modification (increased laten-\ncies and reduced peaks). We modelled the data to analyse the fixed effects of session (PRE/POST), with puberty \nscore as a covariate, and their interaction, while taking into consideration the inter- and intra-individual vari-\nability. For each parameter, the model equation was the following: parameter ~ session + poly(puberty,2) + ses-\nsion × poly(puberty,2) + (1|subjects). We especially looked for a main effect of session indicating that children, \nadolescents and young adults had modified kinematics after tool use, as well as an interaction with puberty \nwhich would indicate that the pattern changes with development.\nTool use. The model based on the principal component analysis was not better fitted with a quadratic curve as \ncompared to a linear one (χ2(2) = 3.03; p = 0.219). We thus used a linear fit for each kinematic parameter of the \ntool movement. As the kinematics characteristics of the tool session are known in adults, here we investigated if \nand when the same patterns were observable in children and adolescents. Adult pattern reports no or very few \nkinematics differences between the first and last block of tool use, attesting of a reduced/absent motor learning \n(e.g.5,8). Here, in order to search for an effect of development on tool use session we analysed the kinematics dif-\nferences between the first and fourth block (fixed effect FIRST/LAST) as a function of our continuous variable \ni.e. the puberty score. For each parameter, the model equation was the following: parameter ~  block  + puberty +  \nblock × puberty + (1|subjects). An absence of difference between the first and last block of tool use would witness \nan absence of observable training effect. Any interaction would indicate a change in the pattern as a function of \npubertal development.\nArm length estimation. Previous data in adults showed no influence of tool  use8. We modelled the Arm Length \nEstimation task, to analyse the effect of session (PRE/POST), with puberty score as a covariate. Model compari-\nson showed that data was better explained with a polynomial fit than a linear one (χ2(2) = 11.26; p = 0.004). The \nmodel equation was the following: estimation ~ session + poly(puberty,2) + session × poly(puberty,2) + (1|sub-\njects). Absence of tool use effect on this task would be indicated by an absence of main effect of session. Any \ninteraction would indicate a change in the pattern as a function of pubertal development.\nMixed model analyses were performed with “R”67 on participants’ individual trials (18 per subject, per PRE/\nPOST session; 12 per subject per block for the tool session) for each kinematic parameter (or for the meta-\nparameter from the Principal Component Analysis), and on the length estimation (18 trials per subject, per \nsession). We used lme4 68, lmerTest69 and car70 packages. The package car  was used to obtain main effects and \ninteractions from the output of lme4 (based on Type III Wald chisquare tests; we report these values in the results \nrather than the output from lme4). This analysis, akin to an ANCOV A in terms of interpretation, allows a better \naccount for variability and for the unbalanced sample size for each puberty score.\nUsing this method, in case of significant interactions indicating a change in the kinematic pattern, we can \nalso calculate the exact point where this occurs, for each kinematic parameter. To do so, from each fitted model \nwe estimated the (non-linear) curve of the parameter (i.e., Velocity, Acceleration etc.) for each condition. We \ntested point-by-point whenever the two conditions differ. The interval of Puberty Scores where differences \nbetween PRE and POST were not significant (significance level 5%) is defined as the interval of equivalence. \nThe crossing point of the curves of the two conditions is the point where the two conditions equalise. We report \n6\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nboth crossing points and intervals of equivalence. We additionally computed the crossing point on the meta-\nparameter from the principal component analysis. We prefer this method since it allows to compute the global \ninterval of equivalence, which is not possible when simply reporting the average and median of each individual \ncrossing point. For sake of completeness, we still report these values in the analysis.\nResults\nFree-hand movement. Tool use affects the reaching kinematics differently according to puberty. System-\natic main effects of session (PRE/POST) were observed on the reaching component for all the amplitudes (all \np < 0.004), and on the acceleration latency (χ2(1) = 6.61; p = 0.010). No significant session effect was observed on \nthe velocity latency (χ2(1) = 0.035; p = 0.851), the deceleration latency (χ2(1) = 0.733; p = 0.392) and movement \ntime (χ2(1) = 0.266; p = 0.606). These results indicate a global effect of tool use on subsequent free-hand reach-\ning movements, which will be interpreted in line of the presence or absence of an interaction. Conversely, there \nwas no main effect of puberty score on any of these parameters (all p > 0.441) or movement time (χ2(2) = 0.615; \np = 0.735).\nOf main interest, significant interactions between session and puberty score were observed on all parameters \n(all p < 0.001), except the acceleration latency ( χ2(2) = 5.27; p = 0.072). While reaching kinematics was initially \nindependent of the puberty score, tool use-dependent changes were highly modulated by puberty stages (Fig. 2). \nIndeed, after tool use, early-puberty participants displayed larger amplitudes (Figs.  2 and 3 a,b) and shorter \nlatencies (Figs. 2 and 3c,d). They reached faster with their hand after having used the tool. Conversely, after tool \nuse, late-puberty participants displayed smaller amplitudes and longer latencies, resulting in a longer movement \ntime (Figs. 2 and 3).\nConsistency of these results on the whole reaching component were confirmed by the principal component \nanalysis (percentage of explained variance for the first component: 66.2%), with no significant effect of the \npuberty (χ2(2) = 0.22; p = 0.898), a significant main effect of session (χ 2(1) = 7.14; p = 0.008) and a significant \nglobal interaction between puberty and session (χ 2(2) = 58.1; p < 0.001). Overall, puberty did not impact the \ninitial free-hand kinematics but did affect the pattern observed after tool use.\nTool use affects the grasping kinematics according to puberty. Similar effects were observed on the grasping \ncomponent with significant main effects of session (PRE/POST) for the MGA latency (χ 2(1) = 4.75; p = 0.029) \nand the MGA (χ 2(1) = 56.1; p < 0.001). A significant main effect of puberty was observed for the MGA peak \n(χ2(2) = 7.35; p = 0.025), but not for its latency (χ2(2) = 1.88; p = 0.391). Interactions reached significance for both \nparameters (all p < 0.001; Fig. 4). Regarding latency, this interaction was similar to what reported above: early \npuberty participants opened their fingers sooner after tool use, while late puberty ones displayed longer latencies \n(Fig. 4a,b). Concerning the grip amplitude, the significant interaction with puberty suggests that grip aperture \nwas more dependent on puberty before tool use. In the PRE session, late puberty participants displayed larger \ngrip aperture. Y et, after tool use, grip aperture did not vary as a function of puberty (Fig. 4c,d). Noteworthy, late \npuberty participants still modulated their grip aperture after tool use.\nConsistency of these results on the whole grasping component were confirmed by the principal component \nanalysis (percentage of explained variance for the first component: 62.3%), with no significant effect of puberty \n(χ2(2) = 4.51; p = 0.11), a significant main effect of session (χ2(1) = 34.9; p < 0.001) and a significant global interac-\ntion between puberty and session (χ2(2) = 58.2; p < 0.001). Overall, puberty did not impact the initial kinematics, \nbut affected the pattern observed after tool use.\nCrossing point. For each parameter of the reaching and grasping components, we observed a crossing point \non the puberty scale beyond which the kinematics pattern reversed. Table  2 reports this crossing point and its \nFigure 2.  Average kinematic profile (18 trials) of representative early puberty (PS = 7, left panel) and late \npuberty participants (PS = 20, right panel). The kinematics changes after tool use are opposite as a function \nof the puberty score. Instead of the increased latencies and reduced amplitudes displayed by late puberty \nparticipants, early puberty ones displayed shortened latencies and larger peak amplitudes.\n7\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ninterval of equivalence (no significant difference between PRE and POST) for each parameter, as given by the \nPrincipal Component Analysis.\nAfter grouping all the crossing points together, a Principal Component Analysis revealed that average crossing \npoint was 16 on the puberty scale, with an interval of equivalence of [14; 17]. This result is also consistent with \nthe average (15.7) and the median (16.7) crossing point among all parameters. When referring to the puberty \n scale63, such a score corresponds to participants getting a score of about 3 for each question meaning that changes \nare “definitely underway” , as defined in the scale, which corresponds to mid puberty.\nTool movement. Tool use practice effects on reaching reduce with puberty. Systematic main effects of block \n(FIRST/LAST) were observed for all the parameters of the reaching component and the movement time (all \np < 0.026). This indicates a global improvement in performance on the last block of tool use: participants were \nfaster at the 4th block of practice with the tool, resulting in a shorter movement time. Conversely, there was no \neffect of puberty score on any of the parameters (all p > 0.439, except Movement Time: χ2(1) = 3.34; p = 0.067).\nSignificant interactions were observed in 3 out of 6 reaching parameters: acceleration latency ( χ2(1) = 5.17; \np = 0.023), acceleration amplitude (χ2(1) = 11.5; p < 0.001) and velocity latency (χ2(1) = 7.67; p = 0.006). Interac-\ntion with movement time was also significant ( χ2(1) = 26.8; p < 0.001). These interactions indicate that the dif -\nference between the first and the last block decreases as the puberty score increases (Fig.  5a,b).\nConsistency of these results on the whole reaching component were confirmed by the principal component \nanalysis (percentage of explained variance for the first component: 60.9%), with no significant effect of the \npuberty (χ2(1) = 0.02; p = 0.879), a significant main effect of block (χ2(1) = 57.3; p < 0.001) and a significant global \ninteraction between puberty and block (χ2(1) = 9.58; p = 0.002). Overall, puberty did not impact the kinematics \nduring tool use and training effects reduced as puberty progresses.\nFigure 3.

Panels (a) and (c) are representative illustrations of the \npolynomial fit of the data for the acceleration amplitude (a) and the velocity latency (c), with the 95% confidence \ninterval indicated by colored areas.

There was a main effect of block on MGA latency \n(χ2(1) = 18.5; p < 0.001), but no effect of puberty score (χ2(1) = 0.646; p = 0.422), nor an interaction between the \ntwo (χ2(1) = 1.07; p = 0.300). This indicated that all the participants, whatever their puberty score, opened the \ntool “fingers” earlier in the last block of tool use, consistent with a faster movement. As for the MGA, there was a \nmain effect of block (χ2(1) = 12.6; p < 0.001), of puberty (χ2(1) = 8.28; p = 0.004), and an interaction between the \ntwo (χ2(1) = 23.3; p < 0.001). This indicated that late puberty participants displayed a larger opening of the tool \nand reduced their MGA during the last block of tool use, while younger ones did not particularly modulate it.\nConsistency of these results on the whole grasping component were confirmed by the principal component \nanalysis (percentage of explained variance for the first component: 60.4%), with no significant effect of the \npuberty (χ2(1) = 1.99; p = 0.158), a significant main effect of block (χ2(1) = 22.9; p < 0.001) and a significant global \ninteraction between puberty and block (χ2(1) = 10.56; p = 0.001).\nArm length estimation. As stated earlier, this task allowed to control for the specificity of tool use on dif-\nferent body representations. As it is an explicit judgement of arm length, this tasks targets the conscious body \nimage, so far reported as being immune to tool use in mid-twenties  adults8. Transforming the estimation in \npercent of the veridical arm length allowed us to assess the effect of puberty independent of the difference in \narm length over development. There was a main effect of the session (χ2(1) = 42.6; p < 0.001) showing a reduced \nestimated arm length after tool use, a non-significant effect of the puberty (χ2(2) = 5.04; p = 0.080) and an inter-\naction between the two (χ2(2) = 35.6; p < 0.001). The non-significant effect of puberty suggests that overall, par-\nticipants did not estimate their arm length differently according to their pubertal development. The interaction \nhighlighted a very early crossing point (7.5), with no significant differences between PRE and POST for puberty \nscores [6; 8]. It thus appears that most of the participants (puberty score > 9) modulated their estimation after \ntool use in the direction of a shorter arm after tool use, while early puberty participants did not. (Fig. 6).\nGesture imitation proficiency. As some studies reported that puberty could lead to transient \n clumsiness46,51, we measured the gesture imitation abilities of our participants as an index of such clumsiness. \nThe total mean on gesture imitation task was 57/72 ± 7.7 (see Table 1 for details per puberty score). Performing \nthe imitation anatomically increased task difficulty, as the participants’ score was overall lower than the cutoffs \nvalues when imitation is mirrored as in the original version (Fig. 7; healthy ≥ 62; apraxia ≤ 5361), for most of the \nsample as well as an additional group of 12 older healthy adults that we recruited (Mean age = 26.2 ± 2.5; 7 girls; \nthree left-handed; Mean score = 63/72). These categorizations should thus be here considered comparatively \n(across pubertal stages).\nWhen running simple regression, it appeared that a linear model was the best fit compared to any quadratic \none: the more mature, the better the gestures reproduction. However, when looking at individual performance, \nparticipants matching the puberty crossing point stood out (black ellipse; Fig.  7), as they showed a decrease in \nperformance.\nFigure 5.  Evolution of the kinematics of the Reaching component of the movement during the first (solid \norange) and the last (dashed green) blocks of tool use, as a function of the puberty score. Panels a and b are \nrepresentative illustrations of the polynomial fit of the data for the acceleration amplitude (a) and the velocity \nlatency (b), with the 95% confidence interval indicated by colored areas. Most significant interactions indicated \nthat improvement through tool use is less important in late puberty.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we investigated whether, when and how tool-use-induced plasticity of body representation, typically \nobserved in mid-twenties adults (for review,  see11), emerges and evolves during development. In particular, we \ntested whether any changes in free-hand kinematics are observable during the abrupt variation introduced by \nthe growth spurt in adolescence. We asked typically developing participants at different level of their puberty \nto reach and grasp an object with their dominant hand both before and after using a tool to perform the same \ntask. To control for the specificity of the effects on the body representation for action, we further tested the same \nparticipants for their explicit, subjective estimate of their arm  length8. Besides serving as a control for the effects \nof tool use on the implicit body estimate, this task is one among those that can inform about possible effects of \ntool use on another, explicit and conscious body representation, namely the body  image11.\nRegarding the implicit arm representation, results showed that tool incorporation, as witnessed by kinematics, \nseems to evolve importantly during development and requires a previously unsuspected long time to manifest. \nAt the earliest puberty stages, tool incorporation displays a pattern opposite to the one previously documented in \nadults, as if arm length representation shrank after tool use. Then it progressively reverses, to reach the adult-like \npattern only once puberty is finished, through a period in the middle of puberty when changes in kinematics \nare literally absent. Interestingly, and also at odds with what reported in adult tool  users5,6, most participants’ \nperformance showed training effects during the tool-use phase: tool movements performed during the last \nblock of trials were faster than those performed during the first block of trials. Maturation erases the differences \nFigure 6.  Arm length estimation in percent of actual arm length as a function of the puberty score. Most \nparticipants (puberty score > 9) estimated their arm as shorter after tool use.\nFigure 7.  Individual scores on the gesture imitation test. Globally, performance increased with puberty. Y et, \nmost mid puberty participants displayed poor performance, as indicated by the black ellipse. This group had a \nmean puberty score around the crossing point (see “Crossing point” section).\n11\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nbetween the first and last tool use blocks and progressively settle the increase in arm length representation clas-\nsically observed after tool use in adults.\nRegarding the explicit arm length estimation task, again contrasting what was previously reported in  adults8, \nmost of the participants estimated their forearm as shorter after tool use. In adults, indeed, the visually-driven \nrepresentation of the body (also called body image) is largely immune to tool use effects, as measured by this \n task6,8. Y et, here, we found that this subjective estimate of the arm length was also affected by tool use, and until \nthe late pubertal stages. Two possibilities may account for this difference. On the one hand, as discussed below, \nvision may dominate during development for achieving tool control. This major use of visual information for \nmovement guidance could blur the difference between body state and body image. On the other hand, when \nno effects on the arm length estimation task were observed after tool  use8, participants were blindfolded while \nperforming the tool use session. The absence of visual feedback during tool use may thus have facilitated the \ndistinction between these body representations. Interestingly, there was no crossing point around mid-puberty in \nthis task (by opposition to the free-hand reach-to-grasp task). This suggests that changes occurring during growth \nspurt are likely to play a minimum role in the conscious perception of the arm length. Overall, the availability \nof visual feedback may be at the core of the explicit arm-length underestimation we report here after tool use.\nTool use effects in early puberty: a visually-mediated decrease in arm-length representa -\ntion? Early-puberty participants showed a kinematic pattern opposite to that reported by previous studies in \nadults. In addition, they showed kinematics changes during the tool-use session: they were faster during the last \nblock of tool use, as compared to the first one. After tool use, the pattern of reduced latencies and higher peaks is \nsuggestive of an update of the length of the effector estimate, which is compatible with an arm that is represented \nas shorter. Indeed, early puberty was accompanied by a performance that is opposite to that documented in \nadults (increased latencies and smaller peaks), which is considered as a lengthening or their arm representation \n(see, for  review11). At first sight, the possibility that tool use shortens arm representation may seem unlikely: \nsince the body cannot biologically shrink, it has been posited that the representation the brain used to control \nit can only accept increases in size in healthy  individuals5,71–73. However, a recent study whereby arm length \nrepresentation has been tested during tool motor control, reported an initial fast reduction of the arm length rep-\nresentation, followed by its (expected) increase after protracted tool  use74. Ganesh and  colleagues74 explained the \nsubsequent increase in body representation dimension as a result of the construction of new sensorimotor asso-\nciations. These would serve reducing the computational time and cost for motor planning with the tool, hence \nguaranteeing its skilful use. Conversely, the immediate reduction in arm length representation would follow \nfrom the need of using a new tool, for which no sensorimotor association has yet been built. The control over this \nnew tool would entail a safety margin, enabling to perform the reach under visual feedback  guidance74. Accord-\ningly, the decrease in arm representation would depend on the use of visual feedback. Following this account, \nthe early developmental stages would allow to progressively build sensorimotor associations when facing new \ntools. In our study, participants used this tool for the first time, the difference between the first and fourth block \nof tool use might then reflect the building of new, more appropriate sensorimotor associations. A previously used \ntool shall conversely call for the recruitment of old sensorimotor associations and neither training nor decrease \nin arm length representation may take place. As a non-exclusive alternative, an immature proprioceptive pro-\ncessing, might urge the use of visual  information75,76. As recalled in the introduction, the integration of proprio-\nceptive information is crucial for body representation. In movement execution, children around 7–8 years old \nexperience a transient difficulty in using proprioceptive  feedback43 and improvement in proprioceptive process-\ning would significantly improve sensorimotor integration, suggesting that proprioceptive integration grows with \n development41. When both visual and proprioceptive input allow localization of the target/or participant’s own \nhand, early puberty participants favor visual  information37,38,41,77,78. This may result in a protracted development \nof body representations, children not representing their body size truthfully until quite  late33.\nTool use effects in late puberty: an adult-like, but still incomplete pattern. Our findings on free-\nhand movements after tool use highlight the existence of a developmental “threshold” after which the impact \nof tool use on free-hand kinematics resembles that of adults. Such threshold wherein adolescents were in the \nmiddle of their puberty and growth peak, was marked by the absence of any kinematic modifications of free-\nhand movements after tool use. While this suggests the absence of tool use plasticity in the representation of \ntheir motor effector, the difference in tool kinematics between tool use blocks suggest an on-going building of \nsensorimotor associations. Beyond this point, participants displayed the kinematic profile of adult-like tool-use \nplasticity (longer latencies and smaller peaks), which constitutes a clear pattern reversal. Y et, their motor control \nwas different from what has been previously observed in adults, in two main respects. First, despite being drasti-\ncally reduced as compared to earlier pubertal stages, kinematic modifications were still at play during tool use on \nsome parameters, thus indicating a not fully mature process. Indeed, no change in any of these parameters has \never been observed in previous work in adult  participants5,6,8. Second, the changes after tool use affected both the \nreaching and the grasping components of their movements. Following the use of the type of tool we employed in \nthis study, which mainly elongates the arm functionality, adults’ kinematic modifications are typically restricted \nto the transport component of the  movement5,6,8. These effects are indeed mainly driven by the tool functional \n features72,79,80.\nIn this respect, though more adult-like, the pattern of the late puberty participants was still incomplete. Note-\nworthy, similar findings have been previously reported in the case of a deafferented adult  patient59. Following a \nmedullar lesion, patient DC was still capable of perceiving superficial touch on her affected arm or on a hand held \n tool81, but had lost proprioception and her tool motor control was profoundly altered. After repeated sessions of \ntool use, her free-hand kinematics tended to normalize. Indeed, in adults, motor learning is possible in absence \n12\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:559  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79476-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nof  proprioception82,83, further suggesting that vision might be predominant in the case of tool use for the early \npubertal stages of development. Two elements characterized the profile exhibited by the deafferented patient, \nthough. Akin to what observed in late puberty participants, both the reaching and grasping components displayed \nlonger latencies and smaller peaks; moreover patient DC displayed tool use training effects, with performance \nimprovement between the first and the last tool use  blocks59. Thus, the findings from late puberty participants \nreported here remarkably resemble those of the proprioceptively deafferented adult, in that they both lack of \nspecificity for the transport component and display kinematic modifications during tool use.\nWe suggest that a slow process of progressively increased reliance on proprioception during development, \ncould be at the basis of the pattern we observed. When their puberty is “definitely underway” 63, matching the \nfast growth  period84, mid-puberty adolescents would still be unable to properly use the proprioceptive signals \nto update their body state. With the progressive refinement of proprioception, late puberty adolescents would \nthen display a more adult-like behaviour. These findings are in keeping with the transient period of “propriocep-\ntive neglect” during adolescence put forward for postural control, when adolescents fail to make a proper use of \n proprioception35,57,58,85. Note that, when the use of visual feedback is sufficient to fulfil a task, adolescents do not \nbehave as if their body representation could not follow their growth  spurt47, reinforcing the central role played \nby proprioception. Interestingly, the crossing point in which no effects of tool use were observed on kinematics, \ncorresponds to puberty scores of adolescents who displayed poor performance in our gesture imitation task. \nThis finding suggests that clumsiness might emerge when body representation plasticity is lacking in either \n direction48. Altogether, these findings suggest that proprioception might be at the core of developmental tool use \nincorporation and clearly disclose that its contribution goes through numerous changes during development, \nwhereby vision may initially play a greater role and proprioception may later play a greater role at later stages.\nIn the light of the present findings, we additionally suggest that adults quickly update their body representa-\ntion and set the state of the effector as ‘longer’ while using a tool, but this plasticity requires a long developmental \nphase to be achieved in full. During development, novel sensorimotor associations patterns are experienced that \nmay contribute to the ultimate goal of achieving optimal control over novel  effectors8. This seems to imply (1) to \nswitch the initial vision-based control in favor of a proprioception-based control and (2) to build new sensori -\nmotor associations. Until these processes are not complete, the control of a tool would initially imply to reduce \narm length (likely because of the predominant visual control) and the repetitive use of the tool would speed up \nmovement execution (possibly because of a learning mechanism). From this perspective, the developmental \ntrajectory through pubertal stages could replicate what has been observed (in a much shorter, individual time \nscale) during tool use by Ganesh and colleagues in  adults74. This may have implications for sports and tool-related \nskilfulness acquisition  (see46), suggesting that training might benefit being adapted according to the pubertal \nstage of the trainees, an interesting question for future research.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this study discloses that plasticity of body representation following tool use develops until the \nadult age. Tool incorporation, as indexed by the adult typical kinematic pattern, develops very slowly, becom -\ning apparent only after adolescence. As long as adulthood is not reached, tool use behavior would rather rely \non vision, inducing a representational shrinking of the arm after tool use. As they grow up, adolescents would \nprogressively rely on proprioception, before being able to incorporate tool as adults do.\nData availability\nAll data and code used in this study are available on the website of the Open Science Framework (OSF) and can \nbe accessed at https ://osf.io/3g9mz /.\nReceived: 8 September 2020; Accepted: 4 December 2020\nReferences\n 1.
