Popular KGs\n(e.g, Wikidata, NELL) are built in either a supervised or semi-supervised manner,\nrequiring humans to create knowledge. Recent deep language models automat-\nically acquire knowledge from large-scale corpora via pre-training. The stored\nknowledge has enabled the language models to improve downstream NLP tasks,\ne.g., answering questions, and writing code and articles. In this paper, we propose\nan unsupervised method to cast the knowledge contained within language models\ninto KGs. We show that KGs are constructed with a single forward pass of the pre-\ntrained language models (without ﬁne-tuning) over the corpora. We demonstrate\nthe quality of the constructed KGs by comparing to two KGs (Wikidata, TAC\nKBP) created by humans. Our KGs also provide open factual knowledge that is\nnew in the existing KGs. Our code and KGs will be made publicly available.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) are an important resource for both humans and machines. Factual knowl-\nedge in KGs is injected into AI applications to imitate important skills possessed by humans, e.g.,\nreasoning and understanding. KG construction is mainly supervised, requiring humans to handwrite\nevery fact, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and Wikidata. KGs can also be constructed in a\nsemi-supervised way, in which a semi-automatic extractor is used to obtain the facts from web cor-\npora (e.g., NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) and Knowledge Vault (Dong et al., 2014)). Humans however\nstill need to interact with the extractor to improve the quality of the discovered facts. Therefore,\nhuman supervision, which is often expensive, is required in constructing KGs.\nRecent progress in language models (LMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and GPT-2/3 (Rad-\nford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), has led to superior results even outperforming humans in a\nwide range of tasks, e.g., sentence classiﬁcation (Wang et al., 2018), question answering (Brown\net al., 2020). Pre-trained LMs are also capable to write poetry, music, and code, while such tasks\noften require we human to spend a signiﬁcant amount of time in learning the relevant knowledge to\nwork well. In fact, these pre-trained LMs automatically acquire factual knowledge from large-scale\ncorpora (e.g., BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015), Common Crawl (Brown et al., 2020)) via pre-training.\nThe learned knowledge in pre-trained LMs is the key to the current success. We therefore consider\nthe following question: instead of using the manually created knowledge,can we use the knowledge\nstored in pre-trained LMs to construct KGs?\nIn this paper, we design an unsupervised approach called M AMA that successfully recovers the\nfactual knowledge stored in LMs to build KGs from scratch. M AMA constructs a KG with a single\nforward pass of a pre-trained LM (without ﬁne-tuning) over a textual corpus. As illustrated in\nFigure 1, MAMA has two stages: Match and Map. Match stage generates a set of candidate facts by\nmatching the facts in the textual corpus with the knowledge in the pre-trained LM. General or world\nknowledge from large-scale corpora is embedded in the LM, thus candidate facts in the target corpus\nare often covered by the knowledge in the LM. The candidate facts are matched through an efﬁcient\nbeam search in the attention weight matrices of the pre-trained LM without ﬁne-tuning.

M AMA constructs an open knowledge graph (KG)\nwith a single forward pass of the pre-trained language model (LM) (without ﬁne-tuning) over the corpus. Given\nthe input: a textual corpus containing passages and sentences, e.g., English Wikipedia, and a pre-trained LM,\ne.g., BERT, GPT-2/3, M AMA (1) generates a set of candidate facts via matching the knowledge in the pre-\ntrained LM with facts in the textual corpus, e.g., a candidate fact (Dylan, is, songwriter) from the sentence\n“Dylan is a songwriter.”, and (2) produces an open KG by mapping the matched candidate facts to both an\nexisting KG schema, e.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, occupation.P106, Songwriter.Q753110) in Wikidata schema, and\nan open schema, e.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, sign, Albert Grossman.Q708584).\nproduces an open KG via mapping the matched candidate facts from Match stage to both ﬁxed KG\nschema and open schema. If the schema of candidate facts exists in the KG schema, we map the\ncandidate facts directly to the ﬁxed KG schema. Otherwise, we reserve the unmapped candidate\nfacts in the open schema. This results in a new type of KG, open KG, with a mixture of mapped\nfacts in ﬁxed KG schema and unmapped facts in the open schema.\nOur contributions are as follows:\n1. We show how to construct KGs from pre-trained LMs . The KGs are constructed with a\nsingle forward pass of the pre-trained LMs without ﬁne-tuning over the textual corpora.\nThis helps researchers explicitly understand what the language models learn, bridging the\ndeep LM and KG communities through enhanced model transparency.\n2. We propose an unsupervised two-stage approach, MAMA, to ﬁrst match the candidate facts\nin the corpora with the knowledge stored in LMs, then map the matched candidate facts to\nboth ﬁxed and open schema to produce a KG.\n3. We generate a new type of KG, namely open KG, consists of mapped facts in the ﬁxed KG\nschema of existing KGs (Wikidata and TAC KBP) annotated by humans; and unmapped\nfacts in the open schema that are new in the reference KG schema. The reach of this result\nis broad and has downstream utility for knowledge graph construction, deep neural network\ninterpretation, and information extraction.\n2 M AMA\nWe introduce an unsupervised end-to-end approach Match and Map (M AMA) as illustrated in Fig-\nure 1 to construct open knowledge graphs (KGs) from language models (LMs). M AMA constructs\nthe KGs with a single forward pass of the pre-trained LMs (without ﬁne-tuning) over the corpora.\nThe two stages of MAMA are:\nMatch generates a set of candidate facts from a textual corpus. LMs contain global or world knowl-\nedge learned from large-scale corpora, which often does not perfectly match the knowledge in the\ntarget corpus. The goal of this stage is to match the knowledge stored in pre-trained LMs with facts\nin the corpus. Each fact is represented as a triplet(head, relation, tail) 1, in short, (h, r, t), and passed\nto Map stage. Match procedure is detailed in Sec. 2.1.\nMap produces an open KG using the matched candidate facts from Match stage. The constructed\nopen KG has two portions: (a) mapped candidate facts that are in a ﬁxed KG schema, e.g., (Dylan,\nis, songwriter) is mapped to (Bob Dylan.Q392, occupation.P106, Songwriter.Q753110) according\nto Wikidata schema; and (b) unmapped candidate facts that are in an open schema, e.g., a can-\ndidate fact (Dylan, signed, Albert Grossman) is partially mapped to (Bob Dylan.Q392, sign, Al-\nbert Grossman.Q708584) in the open schema. This stage is described in Sec. 2.2.\n1We use the term “head” and “tail” to denote head and tail’s “entities” or “entity mentions” for simplicity.\n2\nPreprint.

The upper part of (a) represents the general matching steps of generating\nthe best matched candidate fact (Dylan, is, songwriter) from the sentence “Dylan is a songwriter.” The lower\nportion shows the corresponding step-by-step process. Given a head-tail pair (Dylan, songwriter) , at each\nstep, the search chooses one of the actions, i.e., START, YIELD, STOP to produce an intermediate candidate\nfact. The search starts by adding the head “Dylan” as an initial candidate (step 0). The matching degree of\nthe candidate is initialized as 0. Next, a new candidate is yielded if the candidate has not reached the tail\n“songwriter”, by appending the next largest attended token (with the largest score from the attention matrix (b)\nof the sentence) to the end of the current candidate, and the corresponding matching degrees are increased by\nthe associated attention scores (step 1 and step 2). Otherwise, the search stops, and the candidate fact with the\nbest matching degree is returned for the head-tail pair (step 3). The attention matrix (b) is from the forward\npass of the LM without ﬁne-tuning over the sentence. “x” marks the tokens to prevent searching backward.\n2.1 M ATCH\nWe frame the matching procedure as a search problem. To obtain the best matched candidate facts of\nan input sentence, the candidates with the top matching degrees are returned from a search process.\nThe matching degree is derived from the search in the attention weight matrices of the pre-trained\nLM, since the attention weight matrices are the container of the knowledge in the pre-trained LM.\nThe attention weight matrices are simply from the forward pass of the LM without ﬁne-tuning over\nthe sentence.\n2.1.1 B EAM SEARCH\nWe design a simple-yet-effective beam search to ﬁnd the best matched candidate facts. For every\nhead-tail pair (h, t) in a sentence, the search maintains the k-best matched candidate facts of the\npair. Let’s ﬁrst consider the search from left to right with beam size equals to 1. An example search\nprocess is shown in Figure 2. Given a head-tail pair (Dylan, songwriter), at each step, the search\nperforms one of the following actions:\nSTART the search from the head. The head h is added as an initial candidate into the beam. For\nsimplicity, we use START(h) to denote the action, which returns a candidate (h,. In Fig-\nure 2(a), at step 0, the head “Dylan” is added as (Dylan, into the beam. The matching\ndegree is initialized to 0.\nYIELD a new intermediate candidate in the beam if the current candidate has not reached the tail.\nThe next largest attended token (with the largest score from the attention matrix) is ap-\npended to the end of the current candidate to yield the new candidate. The corresponding\nmatching degrees are increased by the associated attention scores. At step 1 (orange arrow\nin Figure 2(a)), “is” is appended to the current candidate to yield (Dylan, is, , since “is”\nhas the largest attention score with “Dylan” in the attention matrix. The attention score is\n0.3 as highlighted in orange in Figure 2(b). The multi-head attention is reduced to a single\nhead so that every two tokens of the sentence are associated with one attention weight. We\nexperiment with different reduction setups in Sec. A.3. “x” marks the tokens (prior to the\ncurrent token) that are not considered in the search to prevent searching backward. Step 2\nsimilarly takes YIELD action to produce (Dylan, is songwriter, . We use YIELD(c, s,As)\nto denote the action, wherec is a current candidate, s represents the sentence, and As is the\n3\nPreprint. Under review.\nAlgorithm 1 Beam search for matching candidate facts.\nInput: Head-tail pair (h, t), sentence s, attention matrix As, action manager O= {START, YIELD, STOP},\nbeam size k\nOutput: Candidate facts T(h,t)\n1: T(h,t) ←{START(h)} ⊿ Start by adding the head as a candidate in the beam\n2: while ∃c ∈T(h,t)[O(c) =YIELD] do\n3: ˜T(h,t) ←∅ ⊿ Initialize a new beam\n4: for each c ∈T(h,t) do\n5: if O(c) =YIELD then\n6: ˜T(h,t) ←˜T(h,t) ∪{YIELD(c, s,As)} ⊿ Yield a new candidate if not reached the tail\n7: else\n8: ˜T(h,t) ←˜T(h,t) ∪{STOP(c, t)} ⊿ Stop then produce a valid fact if reached the tail\n9: end if\n10: end for\n11: T(h,t) ←TOP(k, ˜T(h,t)) ⊿ Maintain k-best candidates in the beam\n12: end while\n13: return T(h,t)\nattention matrix from the forward pass of the pre-trained LM over s, which yields a new\ncandidate.\nSTOP the search step if the candidate has reached the tail, then add the candidate as a valid candidate\nfact into the beam. As beam size equals to 1, (Dylan, is, songwriter) is the only returned\ncandidate fact for the given pair. We denote this step using STOP(c, t), which returns a\nvalid fact.\nThe details of the proposed beam search are in Algorithm 1. The inputs of the search algorithm are\na head-tail pair (h, t), a sentence s, an attention matrix As of s. Both h and t are identiﬁed by the\nnoun chunk in s. As is the attention matrix associated with s from the forward pass of LM without\nﬁne-tuning. The search gets started by adding the head h as the initial candidate in the beam (line\n1). While there are still new candidates waiting to be yielded (line 2), the search continues, and the\ntop k candidates sorted by the matching degrees are maintained (line 3-11) in the beam. In practice,\nwe implement an action manager Oto decide which action to take at each step. Given a candidate\nc in the beam, O(c) = START always happens at the beginning of the search. If c has not reached\nthe tail t yet, O(c) = YIELD. Otherwise, O(c) = STOP. We also notice some facts are in reverse\norder in the sentence, e.g., “··· said Jason Forcier , a vice president at battery maker A123 Systems\nInc.” for facts of relation “org:topmembers employees”, thus enable bidirectionality by running the\nalgorithm in both directions (left to right and right to left). The beam search is implemented by the\nbreadth-ﬁrst search, which is efﬁcient as the time complexity is O(k ·d), where d is the maximum\ndepth of the search tree.\n2.1.2 F ILTER\nAlthough the basic functionality provided by beam search is sufﬁcient for ﬁnding useful candidate\nfacts, we have found a few constraints useful. Given a candidate fact (h, r, t) from beam search\nresult T(h,t), it remains as a fact if satisfying all the following constraints.\nConstraint #1 The matching degree of (h, r, t) is above a threshold. We compare the matching\ndegrees corpus-wide to only reserve the facts that are matched better with the knowledge in LMs. For\nexample, MAMA extracts a fact (Rolling Stone, wrote, pop song) from “Rolling Stone wrote: “No\nother pop song has so thoroughly challenged artistic conventions””, which is not an accurate fact\nbased on the sentence. We observe the associated matching degree is below a proper threshold, while\nthe matching degrees of high-quality facts from the same documents, e.g., (Dylan, is, songwriter),\nor conﬁdent facts from the other documents are beyond the threshold.\nConstraint #2 The distinct frequency of r is above a threshold. To avoid facts to be over-speciﬁed,\ne.g., (Dylan, signed to Sam Peckinpah’s ﬁlm, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid) , we require r should\ntake many distinct head-tail pairs in the corpus.\nConstraint #3 Relation r is a contiguous sequence in the sentence. We can avoid r that has no\nmeaningful interpretation (Fader et al., 2011), e.g., (Rolling Stone, wrote challenged, conventions)\nfrom the above sentence.\n4\nPreprint. Under review.\n2.2 M AP\nThe objective of Map stage is to generate an open KG. The open KG contains (a) mapped facts in\na KG schema (Sec. 2.2.1), e.g., Wikidata schema, if the schema of the candidate facts is within the\nexisting KG schema; and (b) unmapped facts from (a) in an open schema (Sec. 2.2.2).\n2.2.1 M APPED FACTS IN KG S CHEMA\nThe goal is to map a candidate fact (h, r, t) to a fact (hk, rk, tk) in the KG schema. The reason for\nmapping to an existing KG schema is to make use of the high-quality schema designed by experts\n(to avoid duplicated efforts of building from scratch) and enable evaluating the candidate facts with\noracle KG facts contributed by human volunteers. We ﬁrst map both entitiesh, tto hk, tk, then map\nthe relation r to rk in the reference KG schema.\nEntity linking to KG schema We leverage an unsupervised entity linker based on a mention-\nto-entity dictionary (Spitkovsky & Chang, 2012) to link the entities for scalability consideration.\nBesides, contextual information is crucial to link the entities correctly, we use the word embedding of\nthe context to disambiguate the entities, which means we only link the entities with high contextual\nsimilarities based on the word embedding. We adopt the entity linker to map h, tto hk, tk.\nRelation mapping with KG schema We largely follow the relation mapping method proposed by\nAngeli et al. (2015) to construct an ofﬂine relation map between KG relation and relation phrases of\nthe candidate facts. The basic idea is that the more often linked head-tail pairs (i.e., entities are with\ntype information from the entity linking step) co-occur between the candidate facts and KG facts, the\nmore likely the corresponding relations are mapped to each other. In addition, we normalize each\nrelation phrase of the candidate facts by lemmatization, and removing inﬂection, auxiliary verbs,\nadjectives, adverbs. After the relation mapping is constructed, one author manually checks whether\nthe top 15 relation phrases are true mappings for each KG relation. We only reserve the true ones in\nthe ﬁnal relation mapping. This process takes approximately one day. Later, r is mapped to rk with\nan efﬁcient look-up operation in the relation mapping.\n2.2.2 U NMAPPED FACTS IN OPEN SCHEMA\nAn unmapped candidate fact (h, r, t) means at least one of h, r, and t is not mapped to the KG\nschema based on the method in Sec. 2.2.1. There are two types of unmapped candidate facts:\nPartially unmapped facts represent at least one of h, r, and t are mapped to the KG schema. It can\nbe h or t mapped to hk or tk based on the entity linker in Sec. 2.2.1. It can also be r that mapped\nto rk using the relation mapping in Sec. 2.2.1. This actually results in unmapped facts that are in a\nmixture of the KG schema and the open schema. As the overall schema of the unmapped facts is\nnot in the KG schema, we use open schema to denote such unmapped facts in the rest of the paper\nfor simplicity. An example is (Dylan, signed, Albert Grossman) in Figure 1, where both head and\ntail are linked to Wikidata schema based on the entity linker in Sec. 2.2.1, but the relation cannot be\nmapped since there is no relation mapping from “signed” to a KG relation in Wikidata schema.\nCompletely unmapped facts indicate all h, r, and t are not mapped to the KG schema. This means\nneither the entity linker nor the relation mapping is able to maph, r, and t to hk, rk, tk respectively.\nThe resulting unmapped candidate facts stay in the open schema, e.g., a candidate fact (Jacob, was,\nA Registered Mennonite)stays the same in the open schema from a sentence “Jacob was a registered\nMennonite in Amsterdam.”.\nThe resulting open KG is a new type of KG that mixes the ﬁxed KG schema with the ﬂexible\nopen schema, suggesting new directions for the next generation of KGs. The open KG not only\ncontains existing knowledge in the reference KGs, but also extends the ﬁxed KG schema with an\nadditional open schema to improve the coverage of the KGs, that beneﬁts the downstream KG based\napplications, e.g., QA and commonsense reasoning (Wang et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020).\n3 E XPERIMENTS\nHow well can language models generate knowledge graphs? We experimentally explore how well\ncan MAMA answer the question in the section. To measure the ability of LMs in generating KGs,\nwe directly measure the quality of resulting open KGs. The open KG (see an example in Figure 3)\ncontains two types of facts: mapped facts in the ﬁxed KG schema; and unmapped facts in the\n5\nPreprint. Under review.\nFigure 3: A snapshot subgraph of the open KG generated by M AMA using BERTLARGE from Wikipedia\npages neighboring “Bob Dylan”.

We ﬁrst quantitatively evaluate M AMA by comparing the mapped facts to oracle\nKGs annotated by humans in Sec. 3.1, then conduct an in-depth analysis of the unmapped facts in\nSec. 3.2.\n3.1 R ESULTS ON MAPPED FACTS\nWe ﬁrst study the quality of the mapped facts. As the candidate facts have been mapped to the\nschema of oracle KGs, we are able to quantitively compare the candidate facts with the oracle facts\nin the reference KGs.\n3.1.1 D ATASETS\nWe compare the mapped facts from MAMA with the facts in two KGs:\nTAC KBP TAC Knowledge Base Population (KBP) Slot Filling is a task to search a document\ncollection to ﬁll in the tail/object entity for predeﬁned relations (slots) for a given head/subject\nentity in a reference KG. We experiment with the reference KG in the 2013 challenge. We use the\ndocument collection and oracle facts of the 2013 task. The statistic of the dataset is shown in Table 1.\nWikidata We use popular Wikidata as another KG. We use all the oracle facts in Wikidata. We use\nthe English Wikipedia as the text corpus, since a large amount of facts in Wikidata is from English\nWikipedia. The statistic is in Table 1.\nTo evaluate the mapped facts, we ﬁrst use Match stage of M AMA to run over the corresponding\ndocuments to generate the candidate facts. Then Map stage is leveraged to map the candidate facts\nto the schema of TAC KBP and Wikidata respectively. The parameter settings, such as beam size in\nAlgorithm 1, are shared across TAC KBP and Wikidata based on the parameter study in Sec. A.3.\n3.1.2 TAC KBP\nTo verify the ability to produce correct facts, we compare candidate facts from MAMA to the outputs\nof two open information systems, which also produce triplets in the form of (h, r, t).\n6\nPreprint.

After collecting the triplets from the system, we\nuse the same Map procedure with M AMA (Sec. 2.2.1) to map the triplets to the corresponding KG\nschema.\nOpenIE 5.1 2 is the successor to Ollie (Schmitz et al., 2012), and it improves extractions from\nnoun relations, numerical sentences, and conjunctive sentences depending on the linguistic patterns.\nSimilarly, the same Map procedure (Sec. 2.2.1) is leveraged to map the triplets from the system to\nthe KG schema.\nWe use two families of pre-trained LMs with M AMA. We use BERTBASE and BERTLARGE from\nDevlin et al. (2018) with M AMA, namely MAMA-BERTBASE and MAMA-BERTLARGE. Be-\nsides, GPT-2s from Radford et al. (2019) are used, i.e., MAMA-GPT-2, MAMA-GPT-2MEDIUM,\nMAMA-GPT-2LARGE, and MAMA-GPT-2XL.\nTable 2 shows the results on TAC KBP. We use the ofﬁcial scorer of TAC KBP Slot Filling 2013 to\nevaluate precision, recall, and F1 on TAC KBP3.\nMAMA constructs improved KGs. From the results, we ﬁnd that all our methods achieve com-\npetitive precision, which is greater than 60%, given the unsupervised nature of M AMA. All the\nproposed methods outperform the two open IE systems. This shows that M AMA is able to produce\nhigh-quality knowledge directly from pre-trained LMs by a single forward pass without human su-\npervision. The results show the effectiveness of M AMA in generating candidate facts from Match\nstage, and producing high-quality KGs through Map stage. We also ﬁnd that MAMA-GPT-2XL per-\nforms the best. MAMA-GPT-2XL outperforms the previous state-of-the-art Stanford OpenIE by over\n2.6% in F1. This shows the proposed end-to-end M AMA is able to recover the knowledge stored in\npre-trained LMs without relying on any extra linguistic features, such as POS tag and dependency\nparser used in open IE systems. The main reason leading to the moderate results of OpenIE 5.1 is\nthat the system generates objects of the triplets with extraneous words, which hurt the performance\nin slot ﬁlling tasks. Even though the proposed methods all outperform the two open IE systems in the\nrecall, however improving recall is clearly the future direction to further improve the performance\nof M AMA. We ﬁnd that the main cause of the moderate recall is the incorrect entities caused by\nspaCy noun chunk as summarized in Sec. A.2.\nLarger/deeper LMs produce KGs of higher quality. BERTLARGE outperforms BERTBASE since\nthe doubling parameter size. GPT-2s share similar trends, where we observe performance increases\nwhen the model size increases. This complies with our intuition on more knowledge is stored in\ndeeper and larger models. Such increases in performance seem subtle on TAC KBP, we ﬁnd this\nmight due to the relatively small number of oracle facts by noticing a more signiﬁcant improvement\non Wikidata in Sec. 3.1.3. We plan to further improve the results with larger pre-trained LMs, e.g.,\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019).\nBERT LMs outperform GPT-2 LMs under similar model sizes . More speciﬁcally, BERT BASE\nperforms better than M AMA-GPT-2 in F1, and M AMA-BERTLARGE outperforms M AMA-GPT-\n2MEDIUM in F1. BERT BASE and M AMA-GPT-2 are similar in size, while M AMA-BERTLARGE\nand M AMA-GPT-2MEDIUM are similar in model size as well. This is mainly because that the\nrecall of BERT LMs is higher than that of corresponding GPT-2 LMs. The result indicates that the\nCloze-style loss function (i.e., masked language model) of BERT is more effective and ﬂexible in\n2https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone\n3There are 2,383 correct oracle facts based on the “manual runs” assessment in TAC KBP.\n7\nPreprint.

We also notice that the precision\nof GPT-2 LMs is higher than that of according BERT LMs. The reason is that the autoregressive\nLM objective captures more accurate knowledge than Cloze-style loss does by not introducing extra\nnoise (e.g., masked tokens) during pre-training.\n3.1.3 W IKIDATA\nWe select our best BERT based method M AMA-BERTLARGE, and GPT-2 based method M AMA-\nGPT-2XL on TAC KBP to compare with Stanford OpenIE (the best open IE system on TAC KBP)\nfor scalability experiments on Wikidata. We follow the same deﬁnition as the slot ﬁlling task to\ncalculate precision, recall, and F1 on Wikidata. Table 3 summarizes the results.\nMAMA is scalable to larger corpora . Similar to the trends on TAC KBP, M AMA-GPT-2XL per-\nforms the best in precision, recall, and F1. The results show the effectiveness of M AMA in gen-\nerating candidate facts and high-quality KGs. We also ﬁnd that M AMA-GPT-2XL outperforms\nMAMA-BERTLARGE by over 1% in F1. This shows that the larger model (GPT-2 XL has 5x more\nparameters compared to BERTLARGE) contains more knowledge, and MAMA is able to restore the\nknowledge. When larger or deeper models (e.g., GPT-3) are used with MAMA, we can expect more\ngains of the KG quality. Thanks to the efﬁcient nature of M AMA, which relies only on the forward\npass of the LMs without ﬁne-tuning, the results suggest that MAMA is scalable to large KGs.\nLarger corpora embed more complete KGs . In particular, M AMA-GPT-2XL outperforms Stan-\nford OpenIE by 5.6% in F1. MAMA-BERTLARGE outperforms Stanford OpenIE by approximately\n4.4% in F1. Both F1 gains are larger compared to that on TAC KBP. This is because that the LMs\ncontain world knowledge from pre-training corpora, e.g. Wikipedia and Common Crawl. The larger\nthe textual corpora are, the more knowledge our method is able to recover and match to the knowl-\nedge stored in LMs. The ﬁnding is particularly important, since we are now able to construct larger\nKGs of high quality from scratch when larger datasets are used, such as WebText2 and Common\nCrawl (Raffel et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Similar to the observations on TAC KBP, the preci-\nsion is higher compared to recall. Wikidata is not fully built from Wikipedia, MAMA could improve\nthe recall by running on those larger corpora to collect more facts.\n3.2 A NALYSIS OF UNMAPPED FACTS\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, the open KG constructed by M AMA is a new type of KG combining the\nﬁxed KG schema with the ﬂexible open schema. We turn to study the quality of the candidate facts\nthat are not mapped to the above reference KG schema, but are in the open schema generated by\nMAMA. We manually judge such unmapped facts generated by our best method M AMA-GPT-2XL\nfrom 100 sampled documents in Wikidata and TAC KBP respectively.\nThe quality of unmapped facts is veriﬁed . We ﬁnd 35.3% of the unmapped facts are true on\nWikidata. We ﬁnd 83.2% of those true facts are partially unmapped facts as deﬁned in Sec. 2.2.2,\ne.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, tour with, the Grateful Dead.Q212533), whose relation is not within the\nschema of Wikidata, while both head and tail are in the schema. The remaining true facts are\ncompletely unmapped facts (Sec. 2.2.2), e.g., a candidate fact(Jacob, was, A Registered Mennonite)\nstays the same in the open schema.\nAccurate entity detection is desired . We also notice 45.5% of the untrue unmapped facts on\nWikidata are due to the incorrect entities detected by the spaCy. Incorrect or missing entity linking\n(to either head or tail) in Sec. 2.2.1 causes additional 9.1% errors in the unmapped facts. 4.5% of\nthe untrue unmapped facts are caused by the missing relation mapping in Sec. 2.2.1. The rest errors\nmade by M AMA-GPT-2XL are incorrect relation phrases, such as uninformative relation phrases,\ne.g., (Dylan, made, his breakthrough), which is similar to the errors made by open IE systems (Fader\net al., 2011). Both entity linking and relation mapping of Map stage rely heavily on the accuracy\nof entity detection from the spaCy noun chunk. We conclude that the main root cause of the untrue\nunmapped facts is due to the errors made by the spaCy noun chunk.\n8\nPreprint. Under review.\nWe observe similar trends on TAC KBP. We plan to leverage crowdsourcing platforms, e.g., Me-\nchanical Turk, to conduct quantitative evaluations over the unmapped facts to better understand the\nstrengths and shortage of MAMA. We plan to identify more accurate entities by relying on attention\nweights in LMs (Clark et al., 2019; Hewitt & Manning, 2019) instead of using extra resources. We\nwill also investigate stronger entity linkers (Kolitsas et al., 2018) and learn a more robust relation\nmapping through weak or distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Ratner et al., 2017). We will in-\nvestigate more sophisticated approaches, such as graph neural networks (Kipf & Welling, 2016), to\ngenerate more accurate relation phrases from the attention weight matrices by considering structural\ninformation.\n4 R ELATED WORK\nKnowledge graph construction can be generally categorized into two groups, 1) supervised ap-\nproaches. Wikidata, Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), Y AGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), Y AGO2 (Hof-\nfart et al., 2013), DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) are built based on human supervision from Wikipedia\ninfoboxes and other structured data sources; 2) semi-supervised approaches. Open information ex-\ntraction systems, e.g., OLLIE (Schmitz et al., 2012), Reverb (Fader et al., 2011), Stanford Ope-\nnIE (Angeli et al., 2015), and OpenIE 5.1 2 aim to leverage carefully-designed patterns based\non linguistic features (e.g., dependencies and POS tags), to extract triplets from web corpora for\nopen schema KG. Besides, NELL (Carlson et al., 2010), DeepDive (Niu et al., 2012), Knowledge\nVault (Dong et al., 2014) extract information based on a ﬁxed schema or ontology, where humans\nhelp improve the accuracy of the extractions. Probase (Wu et al., 2012) produces taxonomies instead\nof rich typed relations in general KGs. MAMA instead uses learned knowledge stored in pre-trained\nLMs without human supervision to construct an open KG, which is a mixture of ﬁxed schema and\nopen schema.\nLanguage models, e.g., BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018), GPT-2/3 (Radford\net al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019),\nALBERT (Lan et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) and Megatron-\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019) contain factual knowledge obtained via pre-training on large-scale corpora\nsuch as Wikipedia and BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015). Studies have leveraged the pre-trained LMs\nas virtual KGs, and show reasonable performance in QA tasks (Dhingra et al., 2020; Guu et al.,\n2020), and language modeling (Khandelwal et al., 2019). LMs are further enhanced by KGs (Zhang\net al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019) to improve knowledge-driven tasks. While the existing work utilizes\nknowledge in an implicit way, the main difference is that our approach explicitly extracts knowl-\nedgeable facts from the LMs. Compare to LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019; 2020), instead of conducting\nfact recall in cloze statements, M AMA directly generates the whole fact in the form of a triplet\n(h, r, t) from a sentence. Besides, the benchmark datasets used with M AMA are larger compared\nto the LAMA benchmark, e.g., Wikidata is 3 orders of magnitude larger compared to the largest\ndataset in the LAMA benchmark.\nNeural network interpretationhere speciﬁcally refers to pre-trained deep language model analysis.\nThere has been a lot of work to understand what the neural networks learn (Linzen et al., 2016; Adi\net al., 2016; Tenney et al., 2019). With regards to analyzing Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based\nlanguage models (e.g., BERT and GPT-3), substantial recent work focuses on both visualizing and\nanalyzing the attention (Vig, 2019; Jain & Wallace, 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Michel et al., 2019; Vig\net al., 2020; Ramsauer et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2020). Instead of analyzing or visualizing, we\nuse LMs to generate structured KGs to directly recover what LMs learn from the corpora.\n5 C ONCLUSION\nWe show that the knowledge graphs can be constructed by a single forward pass of the language\nmodels over textual corpora. We propose a two-stage unsupervised approach MAMA to ﬁrst match\nthe facts in the corpus with the internal knowledge of the language model, and then map the matched\nfacts to produce a knowledge graph. We demonstrate the quality of the resultant open knowledge\ngraphs by comparing to two knowledge graphs (Wikidata and TAC KBP). The open knowledge\ngraph also features new facts in the open schema, which could have broad implications for knowl-\nedge graphs and their downstream applications. The results also suggest that larger language models\nstore richer knowledge than existing knowledge graphs, and generating on even larger high-quality\ntext corpora could continue improving knowledge graphs. Additionally, the knowledge graphs gen-\nerated by our approach can help researchers to look into what the language models learn, so our\ninterpretable knowledge graphs establish a bridge between the deep learning and knowledge graph\ncommunities.\n9\nPreprint.

Under review.\nA A DDITIONAL DETAILS AND ANALYSIS OF MAMA\nA.1 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nTo evaluate the mapped facts, we ﬁrst use Match stage of M AMA to run over the corresponding\ndocuments to generate the candidate facts. For Map stage on TAC KBP, we link to the oracle an-\nnotation of the entities or spans in the TAC KBP corpus. On Wikidata, the entity linking method\ndescribed in Sec. 2.2.1 is ﬁrst leveraged to link entities in the candidate facts to Wikipedia anchors.\nThen a Wikipedia anchor to the Wikidata item dictionary is used to further link the entities to Wiki-\ndata. If the head or tail is a pronoun, we further use neuralcoref4 for coreference resolution. We use\nGloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) embedding for disambiguation. The relation mapping is constructed\nofﬂine for TAC KBP and Wikidata respectively using the method in Sec. 2.2.1. For oracle facts in\nWikidata, we only preserve those facts describing relations that could be linked to a corresponding\nWikipedia anchor. We rule out facts of attributes about entities and facts of auxiliary relations (such\nas topic’s main category.P901) and ﬁnally results in 27,368,562 oracle facts.\nFor Wikidata, at Match stage, we randomly split the English Wikipedia data into 20 partitions, and\nmap the data partitions to 20 distributed servers to run. Each server is conﬁgured with four Tesla K80\n12Gs. We set the max sequence length to 256, and batch size as 32 for M AMA-BERTLARGE and\n4 for M AMA-GPT-2XL. We use implementations of pre-trained LMs in Transformers package 5.\nWe use spaCy sentencizer 6 to segment the documents into sentences. M AMA-BERTLARGE takes\napproximately 48 hours, and MAMA-GPT-2XL costs around 96 hours. The resulting candidate facts\nof Match stage from the 20 servers are then reduced a data server, where a MongoDB database is\nmaintained to store the oracle Wikidata and entity linking results to enable the efﬁcient Map stage.\nTo produce the open KGs, Map stage takes around 18 hours. The setup is similar to TAC KBP.\nMatch stage is done within 48 hours for all the settings. The batch sizes of M AMA-BERTBASE,\nMAMA-GPT-2, MAMA-GPT-2MEDIUM, MAMA-GPT-2LARGE are 64, 32, 16, 8 respectively.\nThe parameter settings are shared across TAC KBP and Wikidata. All the choices are based on\nthe parameter study in Sec. A.3. The beam size of Algorithm 1 is set to 6. The matching degree\nthreshold of Constraint #1 (Sec. 2.1.2) is set to 0.005, and the number of distinct head-tail pairs of\nConstraint #2 (Sec. 2.1.2) is set to 10. To generate the attention weight matrix As of a sentence,\nwe reduce the weights of every attention head in the last layer of pre-trained LMs using the mean\noperator.\nA.2 E RROR ANALYSIS\nThere is still signiﬁcant room to improve M AMA. To further understand the shortage of M AMA,\nwe conduct an error analysis of the errors in precision (i.e., incorrect facts returned by M AMA) of\nTable 2 and Table 3. We choose our best method M AMA-GPT-2XL for the study. We sample 100\ndocuments from the Wikidata dataset, and manually check the reasons for the errors. We ﬁnd 33.1%\nof the errors are caused by incorrect entities, while the relation phrases are correct. The errors are\ndue to the incorrect noun chunk detected by the spaCy 7. 18.3% of the errors are due to the missing\nrelation mapping created in Sec. 2.2.1. Note that we ﬁnd approximately 23.8% of the errors are\nactually correct facts that are new in the reference KGs . e.g., (Bob Dylan.Q392, residence.P551,\nNashville.Q23197) (in Figure 3) is not an existing fact in Wikidata, but it is a correct mapped fact\nbased on our annotation. The rest errors made by M AMA-GPT-2XL are incorrect relation phrases,\nsuch as uninformative relation phrases. We ﬁnd similar errors are made by M AMA-GPT-2XL on\nTAC KBP. Similar to Sec. 3.2, enhancing the entity detection, entity linker, relation mapping, and\nrelation generation are helpful. We also plan to leverage lifelong learning (Carlson et al., 2010) to\nadd true facts to the reference KGs to improve the evaluation.\n13\nPreprint.

We randomly sample\n20% of the oracle query entities as a hold-out dataset to tune the parameters, and use the best\nparameter setting achieved for both TAC KBP and Wikidata experiments. When studying the effect\nof a certain parameter, we keep the remaining parameters as default described in Sec. A.1. We use\nF1 to measure the effects.\nEffects of beam size Figure 4(a) illustrates the effects of various beam sizes in Algorithm 1. We\nﬁnd that in general, the larger the beam size is, the better F1 the setting achieves. This is because\nthat M AMA is able to reserve more potentially correct facts when more candidates are allowed in\nthe Match stage. However, F1 improvement gradually becomes subtle, while the computation costs\nincrease more signiﬁcantly. For sake of the efﬁciency, we do not explore larger beam sizes. We set\nthe beam size as 6.\nEffects of search constraints Figure 4(b) compares the effect of different thresholds of the match-\ning degree of Constraint #1 in Sec. 2.1.2. We set the threshold as 0.005 since it achieves the best\nresult. Note that the summed attention score is normalized by the length of the fact to penalize the\ncumbersome facts. Figure 4(c) shows the impact of the number of distinct head-tail pairs in iden-\ntifying common relations of Constraint #2 in Sec. 2.1.2. The best result is achieved when it equals\n10. This shows that while MAMA mostly identiﬁes frequent relations, it is also able to capture some\nrare relations for the open schema.\nEffects of attention weights Figure 4(d) shows the comparison between attention weights of the\nlast layer and the mean of all layers. The attention weights of the last layer perform better. This is\ndue to the attention weights in lower layers are low-level linguistic knowledge according to (Clark\net al., 2019; Ramsauer et al., 2020), which are less relevant to the factual knowledge for the KG\nconstruction. Figure 4(e) compares the impact of different attention reduction, i.e., mean, max, over\nthe attention heads of the last layer. We ﬁnd the “mean” perform better. The reason is that the token\noften intensively attends to several speciﬁc tokens in the sequence (Michel et al., 2019), and the\n“mean” operator is more sensitive to such information.\n4https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref\n5https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\n6https://spacy.io/api/sentencizer\n7https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features/#noun-chunks\n14\nPreprint.
