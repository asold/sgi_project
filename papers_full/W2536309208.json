Developing electronics that can\noperate in the small form-factor geometries of portable electronics requires new thermal manage-\nment techniques to keep components cool and operational. Many common thermal management\ntechniques, such as mechanical fans, are not possible in smaller portable devices due to size and\nacousticconstraints.Becauseofthis,manyofthesesmallform-factordeviceshaveabandonedforced\nconvection completely and instead have turned to purely passive methods. While these passive\nmethods are efficient and cost-effective, they are inherently limited in the amount of heat they can\nremove from the system. The development of an air mover that can operate within the constraints of\na portable device would enable more powerful devices to be built that could not otherwise operate\nwith a purely passive thermal management system.\nRecently, there has been increased interest in incorporating electrohydrodynamic flows (often\ncalled ionic winds) into portable electronics devices to introduce forced convective cooling\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 71\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\n(Allen and Karayiannis, 1995; Fylladitakis et al. , 2014). Ionic\nwinds have several advantages over mechanical fans; in partic-\nular they can be easily miniaturized (Hsu et al., 2007; Tirumala\net al., 2011), have no moving parts, and produce small acoustic\nsignals. In order to generate an ionic wind, a large voltage (>5kV)\nis applied and maintained between two electrodes. These large\nvoltages can be prohibitive for portable applications due to the\ncosts and size constraints of the power supply required. Therefore,\nit is necessary to pursue alternative methods to drive ionic winds\nthat that can operate in the small confines of a portable electronic\ndevice and under strict voltage and power requirements.\nPiezoelectric transformers (PTs) work through the electrome-\nchanical coupling within a piezoelectric material. Analogous to\nmagnetic transformers, which convert between electric and mag-\nnetic energy to produce a gain in voltage, PTs convert between\nmechanical and electrical energy to produce a similar gain. PTs\nhavebeenmostcommonlyusedtopowercoldcathodefluorescent\nlamp (CCFL), backlighting in portable electronics (Day and Lee,\n2002), as a battery charger in mobile phones (Ivensky et al., 2002),\nor as a DC/DC converter (Yamane and Hamamura, 1998). PTs\nhave been shown to be able to produce very large voltage gains,\nin some cases on the order of 10,000 (VanGordon et al., 2014).\nFor this reason, PTs have recently garnered interest for their use\nin a number of different high-voltage applications, including gas\ndischarge generation (Alonso et al.,2009), x-ray (Gall et al.,2013),\nand neutron generation (Gall et al., 2012), and for excimer lamps\n(Teranishi and Itoh, 2007). In addition, others have used gas\ndischarges produced from PTs to treat the surfaces of materials\n(Kim et al., 2009), sterilize wounds (Teschke, 2009), and to build\nplasma reactors (Itoh et al., 2006).\nAn ionic wind forms as a byproduct of the presence of an\nelectric field acting over a gas discharge. Ions produced by the dis-\nchargeareacceleratedbytheappliedelectricfield,whichwillcause\nthemtocollidewithneutralairmoleculesandimpartmomentum.\nThis process results in a bulk flow driven purely by the applied\nelectric field without the need for moving parts. The heat transfer\nproperties of ionic winds have been studied in depth as both\nan enhancement to other means of forced convection (Franke,\n1969; Tada et al., 1997; Go et al., 2007) or for its impingement\ncooling properties (Mitchell and Williams, 1978; Owsenek et al.,\n1995; Baghaei Lakeh and Molki, 2012). In our previous work, we\ndemonstrated that a PT can be used to produce an ionic wind\nwithappliedvoltagesontheorderof10V,whichweresignificantly\nlower than the kilovolts used in most other approaches (Johnson\nand Go,2015). In this work, we quantify the impingement cooling\ninducedbyaPT-drivenionicwindtogageitspotentialasacooling\ntechnology and to better understand its characteristics.\nEXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nPiezoelectric Transformer\nWhen a voltage is applied to a piezoelectric crystal, an internal\nstress will form within the crystal and cause it to deform.Rosen\n(1956) was the first to discover that this behavior can be used to\nbuild a transformer when two piezoelectrics with polarizations\nnormal to each other are attached. The applied voltage into one\nof the piezoelectrics produces a deformation wave that will then\ntravel through the adjacent piezoelectric. The wave causes the\nadjacent piezoelectric to deform, and produces a voltage on its\nsurface. It is important to note that this effect can also be achieved\nwith a single piezoelectric that has a diagonal polarization, as\nwas done in this study. The piezoelectric used in this study was\na 128°Y-cut piece of lithium niobate (LN). This angled cut was\nchosen because it has been found to be the optimum conditions\nfor peak voltage gain when used for a transformer (Nakamura and\nAdachi, 1998).\nIn general, the surface voltage is at a maximum when the\napplied voltage is at the piezoelectric’s resonant frequency. This\nresonant frequency forms a standing displacement wave within\nthe piezoelectric that must not be interfered with. In order to\nproperly hold the piezoelectric, contacts are made with the piezo-\nelectric where the displacement in the piezoelectric is 0 (nodes\nof the displacement wave). In this work, we choose to operate at\nthe second resonance frequency, causing the displacement wave\nto be half of the length of the piezoelectric as shown inFigure 1.\nThe second resonant mode was chosen for convenience, but other\nmodes could also be used (Kawashima et al., 1994; Gall et al.,\n2013). The piezoelectric had electrodes applied to both of its faces\nwith silver paint along half of its length for simplicity.\nThe maximum voltage gain, Vout/Vin, from a PT is a strong\nfunction of its geometry and piezoelectric properties and is com-\nmonly expressed as (Rosen, 1956),\nVout\nVin\n/ k23k33Q\n( L\nw\n)\n(1)\nwhere L is the length of the piezoelectric,w is the thickness of\nthe piezoelectric,Q is the loss factor of the piezoelectric,k23 is the\nFIGURE 1| A schematic of the piezoelectric transformer. The plot at the\nbottom shows the stress and the displacement within the piezoelectric when\noperated at its second resonant frequency. The mounts from the transformer\nwere designed so that they only make contact with the piezoelectric where\nthere was no displacement (nodes of the displacement wave). For the second\nresonant frequency, these nodes are locatedL/4 from the ends of the crystal.\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 72\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\ncoupling factor for extensional vibration, andk33 is the coupling\nfactorforlongitudinalvibration. Figure 1showsaschematicofthe\nPT used in this study. When operated at its resonant frequency,\nthe voltage gain across the crystal is significant, causing local\nbreakdown at the surface and discharges to form off the corners\nof the piezoelectric. These discharges are what forms the ionic\nwind jets that are of interest for this study. The discharge travels\nnormal to the corners and edges of the piezoelectric, generating\ndistinct ionic wind jets. While difficult to measure the velocity of\nthese ionic wind jets in unbounded flows, prior work has shown\nthese PT-generated ionic winds produce duct flows near 1ms−1\n(Johnson and Go, 2015), but can reach velocities upwards of\n2ms −1 close to the PT.\nIt is important to note that piezoelectric materials have been\ninvestigated for their use as fans in the past ( Schmidt, 1994;\nPetroski et al., 2008). However, these past efforts have differed\nfrom the present work in how the piezoelectric material has been\nutilized. Past efforts have used the piezoelectric material as a\nvibrating “flap” where the motion of the piezoelectric under an\napplied voltage was used to push the air in a desired direction.\nBy contrast, the piezoelectric in the present work is used as a\ntransformer to amplify the electric field at its corners to produce a\ngas discharge. The air is then moved by ions produced within the\ndischarge influenced by the local electric field. Thus, while prior\nwork used primarily the mechanical behavior of the piezoelectric\nto produce the flow, our approach uses primarily the electrical\nbehavior of the piezoelectric to generate flow.\nExperimental Apparatus\nInordertomeasuretheimpingementcoolinginducedbytheionic\nwind jets, a vertical plate was heated uniformly and infrared (IR)\nthermographic measurements of the plate temperature were used\nto quantify the induced convection. Many of the characteristics\nof this experiment have been inspired by similar experiments that\nused different methods of impingement cooling (Liu et al., 1991;\nKimber et al., 2007). A schematic of the experimental configura-\ntionisshownin Figure 2A.Theexperimentconsistedofastainless\nsteelplate(type304)thatwaspulledtightlyovertwostainlesssteel\nrods by springs that were clamped to the far ends of the plate and\nexposed to ambient conditions. The springs allowed for the plate\nto stay in uniform contact with the rods, even after the length of\nthe plate changed due to thermal expansion. The plate was heated\nresistively through a voltage difference applied between the two\nmetalrodsusingapowersupply(PyramidPS-52KX)inserieswith\na set of parallel 10, 5, and 1Ω resistors. The resistors allowed for\nthe voltage drop across the plate to be controlled by adding or\nsubtracting resistors in parallel to change the total resistance of\nthe system and, thus, change the heat flux into the plate. The plate\nwas clamped firmly to the rods in a manner that would allow for\nuniform contact along the rod’s height so that the plate would heat\nuniformly. The voltage drop between the two rods was measured\nusing a voltmeter (Amprobe AM-510) along the height of the rods\nto verify that it remained constant.\nThe PT was mounted normal to the heated plate so that the\ninduced flow would impinge against the plate. The plate was very\nthin (0.005-cm thick), such that the plate could be treated as\n“lumped” and the change in temperature due to impingement\ncooling on one side of the plate could be measured on the other\nside (this assumption will be discussed in more depth in the\nfollowing sections). The temperature of the plate was measured\nwith an IR camera (Flir T420) on the opposite side of the PT. The\nIR camera observed a 6cm\u00025.4cm region on the surface of the\nplate,whichistheobservedareaforallmeasurementsinthiswork.\nThe side of the plate facing the IR camera was painted with a flat\nblack paint with a known emissivity of 0.96 (Ekkad et al., 2004)\nand the IR camera was calibrated using the known emissivity and\na thermocouple in contact with the plate. The side exposed to\nthe impinging ionic wind was unpainted, stainless steel with an\nemissivity of 0.12 (Roger et al., 1979). The entire apparatus was\nFIGURE 2| (A) A schematic showing the apparatus used to measure the impingement cooling properties of the PT -driven ionic wind.

The insets show the view along the axis of the PT.\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 73\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\nplaced within a large acrylic box to ensure that superfluous flows\ndid not contaminate temperature measurements.\nTwo different shapes of piezoelectric crystals were used during\nthis study, both of which are shown inFigure 2B. The first was a\n40mm \u00023mm \u00020.5mm rectangular shaped piece of LN. When\na sufficiently large voltage was applied to the crystal (>10V), the\ncorners and edges of the crystal form discharges and produce\nionic wind jets. These jets travel normal to the surface, making\nseveral different jets that travel in different directions. In order\nto better control the direction of the induced ionic wind jet, the\nsecond shape was made from a crystal that had its end sharpened\nto a tip with a radius of ~20μm, in order to control where the\ndischarge was generated. With this shape, a single jet is generated\noutward from the tip of the piezoelectric crystal, not orthogonal\nfrom its corners. Others have shown that changing the shape of\nthe piezoelectric can improve its performance (VanGordon et al.,\n2010), but none have used the geometry of the piezoelectric to\ngenerate a directional ionic wind jet. Both shapes were tested to\nbetterunderstandthecharacteristicsoftheinducedionicwindjet.\nThe PTs were operated by applying a sinusoidal AC input\nvoltage to the electrodes on both the top and bottom of the PT\n(as shown inFigure 1) using a signal generator (Agilent 33220A)\nconnected to an amplifier (Powertron Model 500A RF Amplifier).\nAs noted above, the PTs were operated at their second resonant\nfrequency (~60kHz) and all input voltages are reported in ampli-\ntude. Additional details on operating PT-based discharge devices\ncan be found inJohnson and Go(2015).\nGeneral Behavior and Key Assumptions\nIn this study, three different measurements of the steady-state\ntemperature distribution along the metal plate were taken and\nare shown inFigure 3. A representative temperature distribution\nalong the heated plate without the ionic wind impinging is shown\nin Figure 3A. Due to buoyancy, there is natural convection, and\nthe natural convection coefficient was higher at the bottom of the\nplate while the air at the top of the plate was warmer, which lead to\nthe lower portions of the plate being cooler. For the same heated\ncondition,Figure 3B shows the induced cooling by an ionic wind\nfromasharpenedPT.Thecoolingeffectofthejetisclear,asacold,\ncircular region forms in the center of the plate and the cooling is\nmore dramatic for increasing input voltage. We also measured the\ntemperature distribution for the ionic wind when the plate was\nunheated, and there was localized heating as shown inFigure 3C.\nThe heating from the ionic wind is due to the discharge at the\nend of the PT heating the surrounding air. This heated air is then\npushed by the ionic wind into the plate and can cause the plate\nto heat if the air is at a higher temperature than the plate. This\nillustratestheunusualbehaviorofthePT-drivenionicwind:when\nthe plate is cold, the ionic jet will heat it, but when the plate is hot\nthe jet will cool it.\nIn order to analyze the temperature contours, energy balances\nare used for each of the cases shown inFigure 3as discussed in\nSection “Heat Transfer Coefficient Calculation.” A few essential\nassumptions are made in these analyses:\n1. The plate is assumed to thermally emit as a gray body whose\nsurroundings are large enough that they can be considered to\nbehave as a black body at a background temperature equal to\nthat of the ambient air.\n2. The temperature variation through the thickness of the plate\nis negligible. To confirm this assumption, the Biot number of\ntheplatewascalculated.TheBiotnumberisanon-dimensional\nnumber used to determine if the temperature variance within\nan object is significant by comparing the heat transfer resis-\ntances inside the body and at its surface. If the Biot number\nis less than 0.1, the object can be assumed to be “lumped”\nand have a uniform temperature throughout the object. For\nthe plate to have a Biot number greater than 0.1, the forced\nconvection coefficient would need to exceed 300Wm−2 K−1,\nwhich is about an order of magnitude larger than what was\nmeasured in this study; therefore, it is reasonable to assume the\nplate is ‘lumped’.\n3. The system is at steady state for each temperature profile. For\na lumped body, the thermal time constant,τ, is defined as,\nτ = ρ cpt\n2 h ; (2)\nwhere ρ, cp, andt are the density, specific heat, and thickness\nof the plate, respectively. Even for natural convection whereh\nis small (h \u00195Wm −2 K−1), the time constant is always less\nthan 10s. Therefore, for each of the aforementioned analyses,\nthe system was active with the desired conditions for>10 time\nconstants to assure it had reached steady state.\nHeat Transfer Coefficient Calculation\nIn order to quantify the heat transfer coefficient h, we applied\nsimple energy balances where convection was treated by Newton’s\nLaw of Cooling\nq′′ = h A (T \u0000 T∞) ; (3)\nwhere q′′ is the heat flux into or out of the body,A is the surface\narea of the body,T is the temperature of the body, andT∞ is the\ntemperature of the air. However, as noted above, the ionic wind\nitself increases the air temperature (seeFigure 3C), and this must\nbe accounted for when analyzing the temperature contours. For\neach of the cases inFigure 3, zero-dimensional energy balances\nwere constructed as shown inFigure 4: Figure 4A considers only\na heated plate (corresponding to Figure 3A), Figure 4B con-\nsiders a heated plate with impinging ionic wind (corresponding\nto Figure 3B), and Figure 4C considers an unheated plate with\nimpinging ionic wind (corresponding toFigure 3C).\nApplying energy balances to each pixel in the temperature con-\ntour, the “local” convection coefficient can be found at each pixel\non the plate surface. The local coefficients can then be combined\ntogether to produce the average convection coefficient, defined as\nthe mean value of all the local coefficients in the observed areas\non the plate. The average was calculated using\n\u0016h =\n∫ H\n0\n∫ L\n0h (x; y) dx dy\n∫ H\n0\n∫ L\n0 dx dy\n; (4)\nwereH andL aretheheight(5.4cm)andwidth(6cm)oftheview-\ningareaontheplate,respectively.Itisimportanttonote,thatsince\nthe average is taken over the viewing area of the plate, this average\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 74\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\nFIGURE 3| Contours that show the temperature of (A) the heated plate without the impinging jet, (B) the heated plate with the impinging ionic wind at\ndifferent PT input voltages, and (C) the unheated plate with the impinging ionic wind at different PT input voltages. The sharpened PT was positioned\n1 cm from the plate. All of the contours are of a viewing area that is 6 cm wide and 5.4 cm tall. (Please note that the contours themselves are at a slightly different\nheight to width ratio than the viewing area, causing some objects to appear stretched.)\nFIGURE 4| Schematics of the three energy balances used to calculate convection coefficients where each case corresponds to the temperature\ncontours shown inFigure 3: (A) heated plate, (B) heated plate with impinging ionic wind, and (C) unheated plate with impinging ionic wind.

For\nthe heated plate case (Figures 3A and 4A), energy conservation\ncan be written as a balance between the heat input and the heat\nlost through natural convection and radiation exchange with the\nsurroundings. At steady state, this can be expressed as\nqg = 2hncAs (T \u0000 T∞) + σ (\"1 + \"2) As\n(\nT4 \u0000 T4\n∞\n)\n(6)\nwhere T is the pixel temperature corresponding to the tempera-\nture contours inFigure 3A, withT∞ being the ambient temper-\nature, \"1 the emissivity of the black paint,\"2 the emissivity of the\nbare stainless steel,As the surface area of one side of the plate, and\nσ the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. Using the temperature contour\nin Figure 3A for T, the local natural convection coefficienthnc\ncould be determined using Eq. 6. For all experiments here,hnc\nhad an average value of 6Wm−2 K−1, which is slightly higher but\ncomparable to those predicted from experiments done by others\n(Vliet and Ross, 1975), and is in good agreement with numerical\nresults (Oosthuizen and Paul, 2010).\nWhen the ionic wind is impinging the heated plate (Figures 3B\nand4B),thesteady-stateenergybalanceismodifiedtoincludethe\neffect of the ionic wind and can be written as\nqg = hncAs(T \u0000 T∞) + σ(\"1 + \"2)As\n(\nT4 \u0000 T4\n∞\n)\n+ hmixAs(T \u0000 T∞;PT): (7)\nThe first term on the right-hand side (RHS) accounts for\nnatural convection on the back of the heated plate, while the\nsecond term on the RHS again accounts for radiation loss. The\nconvection due to the ionic wind is included in the third term on\nthe RHS, wherehmix accounts for both natural convectionhnc and\nthe convection induced by the ionic windhPT. Typically, natural\nand forced convection add non-linearly, and can be decomposed\nwhen expressed as Nusselt numbers, Nu, using the following\nrelationship (Incropera et al., 2007),\nNumix\n7=2 = NuPT\n7=2 + Nunc\n7=2: (8)\nIn this work, convection coefficients are reported instead of\nNusselt numbers in order to prevent confusion due to the extra-\nneous length scale required in the Nusselt number. Since both\nthe natural convection and forced convection operate on the same\nlength scale, the Nusselt numbers can be decomposed, so that the\nforced convection coefficient from the impinging ionic wind can\nbe found using\nhPT =\n(\nh7=2\nmix \u0000 h7=2\nnc\n)2=7\n: (9)\nNote that there is an additional unknown term in Eq. 7,T∞,PT,\nwhich corresponds to the additional heating of the ambient air by\nthe discharge off of the PT device. We analyze this value by using\nan energy balance on the unheated plate with the impinging ionic\nwind jet (Figures 3C and 4C)\n0 = hncAs(T \u0000 T∞) + σ(\"1 + \"2)As\n(\nT4 \u0000 T4\n∞\n)\n\u0000 hmixAs(T \u0000 T∞;PT); (10)\nwhere again hmix consists of both the ionic wind and natural\nconvection components as shown in Eq. 9.\nOstensibly, bothhPT andT∞,PT are independent of whether the\nverticalplateisheatedornot;thatis,thedischargeheating( T∞,PT)\nand fluid dynamics of the ionic wind (hPT) are independent of the\nplate’s heated condition. Therefore, we can use Eqs 7 and 10 along\nwith Eq. 9 to solve for these two values. However, this assumes\nthat the natural convection coefficienthnc is known in both Eqs 7\nand 10. Yet, becausehnc depends on the temperature of the plate\nitself – either heated, heated with an impinging jet, or unheated\nwith an impinging jet – then its value is not knowna priori. But\nbecause of the unique temperature contours induced by the ionic\nwind inFigures 3B,C, it was not possible to determinehnc as an\nindependentvariableforeverycondition.We,therefore,estimated\nit by scaling the values forhnc we determined in the heated case\n(Figure 3A). To do so, we used the ratio between the standard\nNusselt correlation for vertical heated plates (Churchill and Chu,\n1975) at two given temperatures – the temperature of the heated\nplate where hnc was measured and the temperature under the\ninfluence of the ionic wind. This scaling can be written as\nhnc = Nu(Theated)\nNu(Tionic wind)hnc: (11)\nUsing this correlation as a scaling factor provides an estimate\non the magnitude of the temperature dependence of the natural\nconvection coefficient. While this is an imperfect way to account\nfor the temperature dependence, it does allow for the natural\nconvection coefficient’s dependence on its location along the plate\nto remain intact, producing more accurate trends within the local\ncoefficients.\nEquations 6, 7, and 10 were solved in tandem to find the forced\nconvection coefficient, hPT, natural convection coefficient, hnc,\nand the heated air temperature, T∞,PT. These equations were\nsolved for every pixel along the surface of the plate, allowing the\nshape and size of the impinging jets to be quantified. Average\nvalues were subsequently calculated using Eq. 4.\nIn order to account for the propagation of systematic and\nrandom errors within the analyses, error bars were computed\nfor each of the calculated quantities. We included uncertainties\nassociated with extrapolating the heat transfer coefficients from\nthe measured data, including estimates for the bias introduced by\ntheassumedscalingofthenaturalconvectioncoefficientinEq.11.\nFurthermore, each measurement was repeated at least three times\nto account for random errors. The error bars for the plots in this\nwork are set at a 95% confidence interval.\nRESULTS\nSingle Impinging Jet\nThe local forced convection coefficients measured from a single\nionic wind jet generated from the sharpened piezoelectric at a\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 76\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\nFIGURE 5| (A) Contours of the local forced convection coefficienthPT for different input voltages to a sharpened PT. The gap distance wasG =1 cm.(B) The local\nstagnation convection coefficienthPT,0 and the maximum heated air temperatureT1,PT as a function of the input voltage.\ngap ofG = 1cm are shown inFigure 5A. The convection coeffi-\ncients indict that the impinging jet was round and axisymmetric,\nsuggesting that the ionic wind jet takes a similar circular shape\nas it propagates from the PT. As the input voltage increases, the\ncooled area grew larger while the convection coefficient increased\nsteadily until about 16V where it fluctuated in magnitude as\ninput voltages continue to increase. Notably, we were able to\nmeasure cooling for input voltages as small as 7V. For compar-\nison, previous work on impinging ionic winds required input\nvoltages on the order of 6kV to produce any cooling at similar\ngap distances (Owsenek et al., 1995). By using a PT to gen-\nerate the ionic wind, the input voltage is order of magnitudes\nsmaller,makingtheexistenceofanycoolingattheseinputvoltages\nimpressive.\nThe largest forced convection coefficient from an impinging\njet occurs at the stagnation point where a thin thermal boundary\nlayer forms that produces large convection coefficients (Liu et al.,\n1993). The convection coefficient at the stagnation pointhPT,0 as\na function of the input voltage is shown inFigure 5B (averaged\nover three experimental runs). Initially, hPT,0 increased steadily\nwith the input voltage. As the input voltage reached larger values,\nthe stagnation convection coefficient began to plateau to a steady\nvalueofapproximately40Wm −2 K−1. This suggeststhattheflow\nspeed of the ionic wind remains relatively constant for input\nvoltages greater than 16V. A similar trend was also observed with\nthe maximum local heated air temperature T∞,PT, also shown\nin Figure 5B. We observed that once the input voltage reached\n16V, the discharge had engulfed the entire tip of the sharp PT,\nand it could not grow any larger as the input voltage continued\nto increase. However, we did observe that the input current into\nthe PT did not stagnate for larger input voltages, indicating that\nthe power consumption of the PT was continuing to rise. We\nconjecture that the piezoelectric itself could be preventing the\ndischarge from growing stronger, perhaps by acting as an internal\nballast that limits the discharge current.\nFIGURE 6| Log–log plot of the normalized local convection coefficient\nas a function of the non-dimensional distance along the plate for\nvarious input voltages at a gap distance ofG =1 cm. Equation 12 was\nused in the linear curve fit whereC1 was 0.5.\nThe value of the stagnation convection coefficient was used\nto normalize traces along the horizontal centerline of the heated\nplate. These traces are shown inFigure 6(log–log) for different\ninput voltages; their shape is similar to those found by others\n(Mitchell and Williams, 1978; Owsenek et al., 1995). At distances\nfar away from the stagnation point (x/G > 0.3), the normalized\nconvectioncoefficientsbegintofollowthepowerlawrelationship,\nhPT\u001ehPT;0 = C1\n( x\nG\n)−1=2\n; (12)\nwhere C1 is a fitting constant. However, we found that the coeffi-\ncientsonlycollapsetoEq.12athigherinputvoltages.Forexample,\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 77\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\nat 7V, the coefficients had a smaller power than its higher voltage\ncounterparts. As the input voltage increases, the slope of the\ncoefficientsbegantoincreaseandeventuallyconvergetothecurve\nfit provided by Eq. 12. This suggests that the ionic wind takes a\nconsistent shape when the input voltage exceeded a certain value.\nNotably, this is the same input voltage when the plateau in convec-\ntion coefficient occurs inFigure 5B, indicating that the discharge\nand ionic wind does not change significantly for input voltages\nlarger than 16V. While Eq. 12 worked for this particular gap\ndistance, G, it does not work for all gap distances. The exponent\nin Eq. 12 is a function of the gap distance, so this would need to\nbe accounted for cases where the gap distance is not fixed.\nMultiple Impinging Jets\nIn addition to the sharpened PT, we also tested a rectangular\nPT, and as noted earlier, for this shape the discharges form off\nthe corners of the PT. As shown by the temperature distribution\nin Figure 7A, the distinct jets that form at the corners of the\nrectangular PT are visible as separate low temperature nodes\non the plate surface. These nodes indicate that individual ionic\nwind jets form at each of the corners of the PT rather than a\nsingle large jet forming from the rectangular face of the PT. The\nair heating from the discharges is shown in Figure 7B where\nthe plate itself was unheated. We observe that the local heat-\ning profile takes the same multi-jet shape as with the cooling\ndepicted in Figure 7A. Both of these are analogs to the sharp-\nened jet profiles shown inFigures 3B,C, with the primary differ-\nences being the multi-jet behavior and the overall larger area of\ncooling.\nFigure 8A shows the local forced convection coefficientshPT\nfor the jet generated by the rectangular PT. As withFigures 7A,B,\ndistinct high intensity nodes with large convection coefficients\nform on the plate. As the applied voltage increases, these nodes\nspread and eventually merge with each other. At 22V, the two\nstrongest nodes begin to intersect, making an oval shape. Unlike\nwith the sharp PT, the intensity and the affected area continued to\nincrease for all input voltages tested in this study.\nThe presence of four distinct jets produced by the corners of\nthe PT becomes more apparent when the distance G between\nthe PT and plate is changed. Figure 8B shows the local forced\nconvections coefficient, while the PT is placed at three different\ndistances from the plate at a constant input voltage (13V). Closer\ntotheplate( G = 0.5cm),thejetsarecrowdedtogether;butfurther\naway (G = 1.5cm), the four jets are distinct nodes on the plate.\nSince there are multiple jets, we defined the stagnation convection\ncoefficient as the maximum convection coefficient calculated on\nthe plate.Figure 8C shows the stagnation convection coefficient\nrecorded across the same range of input voltages for the different\ngap distances from the plate. Unlike with the single jet PT, the\nstagnation forced convection coefficient continued to increase for\ninput voltages greater than 16V, with no plateau observed across\nthe voltage range tested here.\nThis canbe attributed tothe fact that unlike with the sharpened\nPT, the rectangular PT has edges for the discharges to continue\ngrow, while the sharp piezoelectric does not. We observed that\nthe discharge spread along the edges of the face the PT as the\ninput voltage increased, leading to an overall stronger discharge\nand ionic wind. Figure 9 shows the color intensity taken from\ncamera images of the discharge, where the areas of high intensity\nsignify the visible glow of the plasma. The Coulombic body force\nf b that drives ionic winds can be written as follows (Ladenburg,\n1932):\nfb = ρiE = i\u001eAdμi ; (13)\nwhere ρi is the charge density, E is the electric field, i is the\ncurrent,μi is the ion mobility, andAd is the active area over which\nthe body force acts. By growing along the edges of the PT, the\narea over which the electric field generated by the PT increases,\ncausingalargerbodyforceandthuslargerconvectioncoefficients.\nNotably, at 7V only 2 nodes were present inFigure 7A. At the\nsameinputvoltage,dischargeswereonlyactiveonthreecornersof\nthe PT. This discrepancy can be attributed to surface irregularity\non the piezoelectric, causing the corner in question to be less\ngeometrically favorable for a discharge to form relative to the\nothers.\nFIGURE 7| The temperature distribution at different input voltages on the (A) heated plate and (B) unheated plate with the impinging jet generated\nfrom a rectangular PT for a gap ofG =1 cm.\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 78\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\nFIGURE 8| (A) The local forced convection coefficienthPT as a function of input voltage for the rectangular piezoelectric when the PT was placedG =1 cm from the\nplate.

As\nthe input voltage increased, the impinging jets became stronger\nand cooled a larger area of the plate. The size of the cooled area\nas a function of the input voltage was determined by calculating\nthe average forced convection coefficient across the observed area\non the plate surface. Figure 10 shows the average convection\ncoefficient \u0016hPT as a function of input voltage. The steady increase\nintheaverageconvectioncoefficientshowsthattheareacooledby\nthe PT increases along with the input voltage. This coincides with\nwhat was shown inFigure 8A, where the increase in voltage leads\nto larger regions with active discharges.Figure 10also shows the\nmaximum local heated air temperatureT∞,PT for different input\nvoltages. Unlike with the single jet, the air temperature continued\nto increase at higher input voltages. This is likely because the\ndischargeshavemoreroomtogrowalongtheedgesandheatmore\nof the surrounding air.\nCooling Effectiveness\nTo compare the cooling properties of the sharp and rectangular\nPTs, the amount of heat removed by the ionic wind relative to the\nelectrical power input into the PT was computed for both. The\nheat removed from the surface by the ionic wind was computed\nusing\nQout =\n∫ H\n0\n∫ L\n0\nΔTAohPT dx dy; (14)\nwhere ΔT isthelocalchangeintemperatureduetotheionicwind,\nand Ao is the area of an individual pixel. For both the sharp and\nrectangular PTs, the power into the piezoelectric,Pin, increased\nlinearly with the input voltage, fromPin = 0.05 to 0.25W for the\nsharp PT andPin = 0.13 to 0.18W for the rectangular PT.\nThe ratio Qout/Pin is shown inFigure 11for both the sharpened\nand rectangular PTs. Interestingly, for the sharpened PT, this ratio\nreached a local maximum at an input voltage of 10V, and steadily\ndecreased at higher input voltages. By contrast, the ratio for the\nrectangular PT continued to increase with the input voltage,\nindicating greater cooling effectiveness. The sharp PT reached a\npeak effectiveness at an intermediate input voltage because, as\nwas shown in Figure 5B, the stagnation convection coefficient\neventually plateaus, although the peak is at a slightly lower voltage\n(~10V) than the plateau (~16V). Due to the sharp tip of the\nPT, the geometry is more favorable for ionic wind production,\nallowing for stronger ionic winds at lower voltages. However, as\nthe input voltage increases and the size of the electric field is no\nFrontiers in Mechanical Engineering| www.frontiersin.org October 2016 | Volume 2 | Article 79\nJohnson and Go Piezoelectric Transformer Ionic Wind Cooling\nFIGURE 9| The color intensity of images taken at the end of the PT of\nthe glow forming at the end of the PT from the perspective of the\nheated plate. The colored patches correspond to the formation of\ndischarges that produce ionic wind jets, while the dashed line represents the\nlocation of the piezoelectric.\nFIGURE 10| The average convection coefficient across the surface of\nthe plate and the max heated air temperature when the PT is placed\n1 cm away from the plate.\nlonger prohibitive for discharge generation the rectangular PT is\nable to produce ionic winds from its corners. Because of this, the\nsharp PT operates more effectively at small input voltages, but\nstagnates at higher inputs. We did find that the sharp PT pro-\nvides better control of the direction of the induced ionic, making\nit potentially better for some voltage-limited and space-limited\napplications, such as spot cooling in portable electronics. How-\never, the rectangular PT is the superior option for less constrained\napplications because it effectively has four times the number of\njets as the sharp PT, making it a better option for a bulk air\nmover.\nFIGURE 11| The cooling effectiveness of the two piezoelectric shapes\nas a function of the applied voltage.\nSUMMARY\nIn this work, the ionic wind generated by a PT was used to\ncool a heated metal plate at voltages as low as 7V, orders of\nmagnitude lower than previously possible. It was shown that\nthrough the use of PTs, an ionic wind jet can be produced at\nvoltages significantly smaller than previously possible. The dis-\ncharge used to drive the ionic wind also caused the surround-\ning air to heat, causing the ionic wind to cool the plate when\nit was warm, but heat it when it was cool. The induced jets\nacted similarly to other round, axisymmetric jets produced from\nconventional means. The sharp piezoelectric induced a single jet\nwhose strength stagnated for higher input voltages. The rectan-\ngular PT did not stagnate for the voltages tested in this study,\nand cooling continued to increase for higher input voltages. The\ncooling effectiveness of both PTs were measured, and it was\nfound that the sharp PT hit a local maximum while the rect-\nangular PT continued to increase up to higher voltages. More\nworkneedstobedoneonoptimizingPT-basedionicwinddevices\nfor practical cooling application, such as exploring arrays of PTs,\nbut this work serves as an important proof-of-concept for this\napproach.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nMJJ built experimental apparatus, conducted all of the exper-\niments, and analyzed the data.
