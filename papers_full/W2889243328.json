Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common\nmalignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide\nspectrum of signs and symptoms.1 In the past decade, the\ntreatment options for patients with MM have increased\nconsiderably. Together with improved supportive care,\nthese new regimens significantly prolong the survival of\nboth younger and older patients.2 The 2014 revision of the\ndiagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treat-\nment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as\nSLIM criteria [bone marrow (BM) infiltration >60%,\ninvolved/uninvolved serum free light-chain (SFLC) ratio\n>100 or >1 focal lesion >5 mm as determined by magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI)], without waiting for conven-\ntional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment,\nanemia, bone disease) to occur.\n3,4Both the SLIM biomark-\ner and CRAB criteria are listed in Figure 1. Given the\nrecent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment,\nmembers of the European Myeloma Network (EMN)\nagreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response\ncriteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice\nand current care of patients’ .\nMethodology\nThese recommendations were developed by a panel of\nclinical experts on MM based on evidence of published\ndata through August 2017. Expert consensus was used to\nsuggest recommendations, where sufficient data were\nlacking. The final recommendations were classified based\non the GRADE criteria,\n5 which incorporates the strength\nand quality of evidence (Online Supplementary Table S1).\nBased on discussions at the 2017 EMN Trialist meeting\n(Baveno, Italy) guidelines were prepared and circulated\namong all panel members. The manuscript subsequently\nunderwent revision in three rounds until the EMN experts\nreached consensus. In line with the guidelines of the\nInternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors,\nauthorship was based on active contribution during dis-\ncussion, writing and revision of the guidelines.\nEuropean Myeloma Network recommendations\nDiagnostic tools\nBlood tests\nA defining feature of plasma cell (PC) disorders is the\nsecretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins, often referred\nto as a monoclonal M-protein, which can be used as a\ndiagnostic marker, but also for the follow-up of the dis-\nease. Its heavy- and light-chain components can be identi-\nfied by immunofixation and further quantified by serum\nprotein electrophoresis and/or a serum free light-chain\n(SFLC) assay. It should be kept in mind that with persist-\ning disease and possible de-differentiation of myeloma\ncells, the capacity to produce M-proteins may decrease or\nbe completely lost (light-chain escape). In those patients,\nlow M-protein levels, the presence of light chains only, or\neven complete absence of M-proteins and light chains\nmay be mistaken as an ongoing or evolving response.\n6\nOf note, immunofixation is approximately 10-fold more\nsensitive than serum protein electrophoresis and is\nrequired at diagnosis to characterize the phenotype of the\nM-protein, and for confirmation of a complete response,\nwhich is defined as being immunofixation-negative.\n7\nEMN recommendations on MM diagnosis and monitoring\nhaematologica | 2018; 103(11) 1773\nFigure 1. The differential diagnosis between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma and multiple myeloma. The discrimi-\nnation between these monoclonal gammopathies is based on: (i) the plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow, (ii) the presence of clinical symptoms related to\nmyeloma disease and (iii) the existence of biomarkers of disease that allow initiation of treatment.

Due to\ntheir low molecular weight, these SFLC are rapidly cleared\nby the kidneys. In such cases, the monoclonal burden\nshould be measured in a 24 h urine collection or in the\nserum by an automated SFLC immunoassay (Grade 1A),\nthe latter having a higher sensitivity to detect and quanti-\nfy the involved free light chains.7 In concordance with the\nInternational Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), we rec-\nommend the performance of serum immunofixation and\nelectrophoresis on serum and urine samples and a SFLC\nassay for the diagnosis of a monoclonal PC disorder\n(Grade 1A).\nAdditional laboratory tests should be performed for the\ndiagnosis and follow-up of MM patients, such as a com-\nplete blood count to evaluate possible cytopenias, blood\nsmears to look for circulating PC and general biochem-\nistry tests (renal and liver function tests, calcium, phos-\nphate, uric acid, albumin, creatinine, lactate dehydroge-\nnase, C-reactive protein, β2-microglobulin).\nQuantification of serum immunoglobulins by nephelom-\netry enables an indirect measurement of the M-protein or\nthe recognition of a secondary hypogammaglobinemia\nand is recommended for any patient presenting with a\ngammopathy (oligo-, poly- or monoclonal) (Grade 1A).\nThe HevyLite\n® immunoassay quantifies both the\ninvolved and uninvolved intact immunoglobulin chains\nand quantifies them separately (IgGκ/λ, IgAκ/λ, IgMκ/λ).8\nThis assay has prognostic value for progression-free and\noverall survival9 and seems particularly useful when the M-\nprotein is difficult to measure via serum protein elec-\ntrophoresis. This assay is not yet part of the routine\nworkup of MM patients, but may be of value in the follow-\nup of patients and has been included in clinical trials.10\nUrine analysis\nProteinuria should be assessed on urine samples from\nall patients at diagnosis and during the follow-up. If pro-\nteinuria is present, it should be quantified in a 24 h urine\ncollection. Total 24 h protein and Bence-Jones proteinuria\nshould be evaluated by densitometry, electrophoresis and\nimmunofixation. To detect low amounts of monoclonal\nproteins, it is recommended that the urine is concentrated\n200-fold.\n11 These 24 h urine collections are often inconsis-\ntently performed, resulting in incomplete urine collection.\nIn addition, renal function can influence the accuracy of\nthe results, a fact which should be taken into considera-\ntion when interpreting laboratory values. The SFLC assay\ncan be used for the follow-up of patients with light-chain\nMM. A recent French study, focusing on patients with\nlight-chain MM, demonstrated that the SFLC assay is\nsuperior to 24 h urine collection for: (i) identifying\npatients with measurable disease, (ii) following their\nresponse to initial therapy, and (iii) giving a prognostic\nindication of the patients’ response and overall survival.\n12\nThis study included 113 patients with light-chain MM, all\nof whom had an abnormal SFLC ratio and measurable\ndisease parameters in serum, while only 64% patients\nhad measurable M-proteins in the urine, as determined\nby urine protein electrophoresis. Similar results were\nfound in 576 patients with light-chain MM from the UK\nMyeloma IX and XI trials. The disease burden of the\npatients with light-chain MM could be measured and\nmonitored by urine protein electrophoresis in 80% of\ncases. Of the remaining patients 113 (97%) had involved\nfree light chains >100 mg/L, which was sufﬁcient to\nmeasure response to therapy.13 These two studies con-\nfirmed the importance of SFLC measurements to diag-\nnose and monitor patients with light-chain or oligosecre-\ntory MM. The replacement of urine studies by the SFLC\nassay for all myeloma patients remains controversial,\nsince an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study on\n399 MM patients (of whom only a minority had light-\nchain MM disease) found only a weak correlation\nbetween results of the SFLC assay and 24 h protein analy-\nsis.\n14\nIn line with the IMWG guidelines,15we recommend the\nSFLC assay for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients\nwith oligosecretory disease (Grade 2B). However, for\npatients with measurable urinary M-proteins, MM\nshould be monitored by 24 h urine collections. When\nalbumin is the dominant protein found in the urine, a\nglomerulopathy (such as AL-amyloidosis or light-chain\ndeposition disease) should be excluded. The 24 h urine\ncollection remains important when results are discordant.\nBone marrow studies \nA BM aspirate enables quantification of infiltrating PC\nand cytogenetic studies on purified PC. Unfortunately,\ndilution by peripheral blood during aspiration or the pres-\nence of patchy disease (uneven distribution of MM cells\nthroughout the BM) may result in an underestimation of\ntumor infiltration.16 We therefore recommend an addi-\ntional BM trephine biopsy, which may generate comple-\nmentary information (Grade 1B). A BM biopsy correctly\nidentified MM disease in 95% of symptomatic patients\nwith a low PC count on the initial BM smears.16 The cor-\nrect quantification of BM PC is also important because of\nthe 60% cut-off as a biomarker of malignancy. The\nIMWG earlier recommended retaining the highest PC\ninfiltration in case of discrepancy. Finally, the monoclon-\nality of PC in the diagnostic sample should be confirmed\nby multiparameter flow cytometry or by immunohisto-\nchemistry confirming light-chain restriction.\nFlow cytometry of bone marrow cells\nIn cases of monoclonal gammopathies, the most rele-\nvant information provided by multiparameter flow\ncytometry is the identification and enumeration of neo-\nplastic versuspolyclonal BM PC. Regardless of the disease\ncategory, these neoplastic PC share similar immunophe-\nnotypic features, which are distinct from those of normal\nPC. Typically, CD38, CD138 and CD45 (together with\nlight scatter characteristics) are the best backbone mark-\ners for the discrimination of PC. In addition, expression of\nCD19, CD56, CD117, CD20, CD28, CD27 and CD81,\ntogether with cytoplasmic immunoglobulin light-chain\nrestriction, allows a clear discrimination between nor-\nmal/reactive versusmonoclonal PC\n17 and was used by the\nEuroFlow consortium to create a standardized panel\nallowing the quantification and immunophenotypic char-\nacterization of neoplastic PC.18\nDue to dilution and the sometimes patchy disease dis-\ntribution, multiparameter flow cytometry often underes-\ntimates the infiltration but remains important for detec-\ntion of monoclonal PC in the peripheral blood and for the\ndetection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the BM.\nThe Mayo Clinic group reported on the prognostic\nimportance of circulating neoplastic cells in patients with\nJ. Caers et al.\n1774 haematologica | 2018; 103(11)\nnewly diagnosed or relapsing MM.19,20 They recently\nmonitored circulating MM cells at diagnosis and after\ninduction therapy by multiparameter flow cytometry and\nconfirmed inferior progression-free and overall survival\nfor patients with persistent circulating MM cells before\ntransplantation.21\nMolecular studies\nCytogenetics\nMM remains a heterogeneous disease with some\npatients progressing rapidly, while others survive more\nthan 10 years. This clinical diversity is mainly driven by\ngenetic abnormalities affecting the biological characteris-\ntics of MM cells.22 These alterations, summarized in Table\n1, are important prognostic factors and can be divided\ninto primary, disease-initiating abnormalities (hyper-\ndiploidy and translocations involving the IGH locus) and\nsecondary events, related to further progression of the\ndisease.23 Fluorescence in situhybridization on interphase\ncells, performed after purification of CD138+ cells or after\ncounterstaining for the monoclonal light chains, is the\ntechnique required to detect these abnormalities.24\nAlternative techniques that can be used are single-\nnucleotide polymorphism arrays, which are able to detect\nloss of heterozygosity and numerical chromosome abnor-\nmalities, and comparative genomic hybridization arrays,\nwhich mainly reveal numerical abnormalities.\nUp to 65% of patients with MM have translocations\nthat involve the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH)\non chromosome 14q32. The prevalence and prognostic\nimpact of these IGH translocations vary according to the\npartner chromosome (Table 1). Hyperdiploidy generally\nconsists of numerical gains (of the odd chromosomes)\nwith a few structural changes, and is usually associated\nwith longer overall survival. Not all trisomies have the\nsame prognostic impact: trisomy 21 impairs, while tri-\nsomies 3 and 5 improve overall survival and may partially\nabrogate the negative impact of del17p and t(4;14).\n25\nThe most recurrent secondary alterations are dele-\ntion/monosomy of chromosome 13, deletion of chromo-\nsome 17p13, chromosome 1 abnormalities (1p deletions\nand 1q gains/amplifications), and C-MYCtranslocations.\nDeletion 17p13 is considered the most detrimental prog-\nnostic factor (due to short remission after high-dose ther-\napy and an increased incidence of extramedullary dis-\nease) and is present in 8-10% of untreated patients.26\nThis deletion becomes clinically relevant when identified\nin the majority of PC. Different percentages (varying\nfrom 10%-60%) have been proposed to define a thresh-\nold that is associated with an impaired prognosis.27-29The\npresence of a biallelic inactivation (i.e. by an additional\nmutation) of TP53 may particularly shorten overall sur-\nvival.30 Aberrations of chromosome 1 (either 1q21\ngains/amplifications or deletions of 1p32) are common\nand associated with shorter progression-free and overall\nsurvival, particularly the less frequent del(1p32).31\nPatients with adverse cytogenetics may have additional\naberrations: in the British MRC IX trial patients with two\nadverse cytogenetic lesions had a median overall survival\nof 2 years, while the survival of patients with three aber-\nrations (an adverse IGH translocation, +1q21 and\ndel17p13) was only 9 months.\n32 This inferior survival of\npatients with additional genetic abnormalities was also\nfound in an Intergroupe Francophone du Myelomestudy that\nfocused on patients with either del17p13 or t(4;14): for\npatients harboring t(4;14), multivariate analyses showed\nTable 1.Recommended cytogenetic studies with implicated gene alterations and related prognosis.  \n               Cytogenetics

These data revealed a\nhigh incidence of clinically relevant genomic aberrations,\nincluding oncogenic RAS mutations, but also a number of\nrarer and potentially actionable lesions, such as BRAF\nmutations.37,38Of note, the vast majority of available\ngenomic data in MM is still derived from samples\nobtained at diagnosis and does not, therefore, necessarily\nreflect the situation during disease progression. In addi-\ntion, the clinical relevance of most mutations has not yet\nbeen determined and is undergoing investigation in large\nsequencing programs (CoMMpass, The Myeloma\nGenome Project and others).39,40No mutation screening\nhas yet been implemented in standard clinical workflows,\nbut mutational analyses may help to identify potential\ntherapeutic targets (such as BRAF mutations) and to strat-\nify of patients in clinical trials.\nGene expression profiling\nBased on microarrays to study mRNA expression, gene\nexpression profiling gives a global snapshot of disease\nbiology and may help clinicians to classify patients into\nseparate groups with distinct outcomes. The University of\nArkansas pioneered this technique to stratify MM patients\nand to characterize individuals’ disease at the molecular\nlevel.\n41 They identified gene expression profiling patterns\nthat allowed MM patients to be grouped in seven disease\nclasses. Further correlation of their microarray results with\nsurvival data of individual patients identified a list of 70\ngenes (GEP70) that had strong prognostic information.\n41\nSimilarly, the HOVON group identified a 92-gene signa-\nture (termed SKY92), based on the gene expression profil-\ning results of the Hovon-65 trial.\n42,43Other gene expression\nprofiling-based risk models have been developed, such as\nthe IFM-15 and MRC-IX-6 gene signatures44,45Although\nnot routinely determined in the majority of laboratories\nwithin or outside Europe, both the GEP70 and the SKY92\nprofiles are commercially available.\nImaging\nTraditionally, osteolytic bone disease was investigated\nby conventional skeletal radiography. The 2014 IMWG\ndisease criteria also considered small osteolytic lesions (≥5\nmm), detected by computed tomography (CT) or com-\nbined \n18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission\ntomography (PET/CT) as symptoms of myeloma-induced\nbone disease.3 Taking into account these definitions, in\n2015 the EMN proposed a relevant algorithm for guiding\nthe choice of imaging technique.46,47Different European\ncenters have integrated CT into their diagnostic work-up\nbased on its superior sensitivity and its ease of operation\nThis choice was supported by the recent implementation\nas a national standard of care in the diagnostic workup of\npatients with suspected MM in the UK and elsewhere.48\nWhole-body CT has also been integrated into the diagnos-\ntic work-up of the European Society of Medical\nOncology\n49 and the upcoming IMWG guidelines. \nJ.

If whole-body CT is not avail-\nable, conventional radiographs can still be used but must\nbe interpreted with their limited sensitivity in mind. In\nasymptomatic patients without lytic lesions, axial MRI or\nwhole-body MRI should be considered to assess the pres-\nence of focal lesions (Grade 1B). Addition of dynamic con-\ntrast enhancement or diffusion weighted imaging to a\nwhole-body MRI protocol provides additional informa-\ntion on BM vascularization, cellularity, and composition\nand improves the sensitivity of MRI.\n50,51Two or more focal\nlesions on MRI are considered as a MM-defining biomark-\ner.52 18F-FDG PET/CT can replace whole-body CT, if image\nacquisition of CT allows a detailed evaluation of the bone\nstructures from vertex to knees, including both arms\n(Grade 1B).53 18F-FDG PET/CT is important to assess the\npresence of extramedullary disease, known to be an inde-\npendent prognostic factor.\n54The integration of MRI, PET-\nCT and whole-body CT always requires experience, inter-\ndisciplinary consensus and reflection and needs to be cor-\nrelated with blood, urine and BM results. Finally, baseline\n18F-FDG PET/CT scans enable post-treatment follow-up of\nhypermetabolic regions with a greater sensitivity than\nMRI.\n54,55PET/CT is also useful in confirming MRD.56\nEuropean Myeloma Network recommendations for the\ndiagnosis of multiple myeloma: \nThe initial work-up should include: complete blood count, kidney\nfunction tests, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation,\nserum albumin, β2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive\nprotein, calcium, serum free light chains (especially useful in the case\nof light-chain multiple myeloma), 24 h protein collection with protein\nquantification, electrophoresis and urine immunofixation, and bone\nmarrow (aspiration only is acceptable) studies to quantify and char-\nacterize abnormal plasmacytosis (Table 2). The intervals between\nfollow-up studies depend on the response obtained and the patients’\ncharacteristics, as proposed in Table 3 (Grade 2C). After CD138\n+\nplasma cell sorting, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis should\ninclude at least t(4;14) and del17p; analysis of t(14;16), 1q21 gain\nand del(1p32) are also recommended. In addition, bone integrity\nneeds to be evaluated with whole-body computed tomography and/or\nwhole-body magnetic resonance imaging (at least axial).\nQuantification of the level of plasma cell infiltration, serum free light\nchains and magnetic resonance imaging assessment are required to\nassess the SLIM-CRAB biomarkers that define early active multiple\nmyeloma. At relapse, the extent of myeloma-induced bone disease\nshould be re-evaluated, especially if the relapse occurs late after the\ninitial diagnosis. \nStaging and prognosis\nDisease-specific prognostic scores\nThe variable outcome of MM patients depends on dif-\nferences in disease biology, global disease burden and the\nhealth status of the patient. Researchers have developed\nclinical scoring systems in order to estimate individual\nprognosis. The degree of anemia, renal failure and osteol-\nysis were the first disease-related prognostic biomarkers\ndescribed in MM and were all included in the Salmon &\nDurie staging system. Subsequently, β2-microglobulin,\nalbumin and C-reactive protein levels, and proliferative\nactivity of MM cells were found to be additional prognos-\ntic factors, and albumin and β2-microglobulin levels were\nincorporated in the International Staging System (ISS) in\nEMN recommendations on MM diagnosis and monitoring\nhaematologica | 2018; 103(11) 1777\nTable 3.

Other biomarkers have been identified and include\nmarkers of tumor cell proliferation, cytokines, pro-angio-\ngenic factors, indicators of bone remodeling, circulating\n(exosomal) miRNA and imaging abnormalities. Another\npromising biomarker is the serum level of shed B-cell mat-\nuration antigen, which correlates well with BM PC infil-\ntration and declines according to tumor response.57\nFollow-up of serum B-cell maturation antigen levels seems\nof interest in patients with non-secretory disease, for\nwhom we lack reliable parameters in the blood; future\nstudies are therefore warranted.\nApart from the often still reported Salmon & Durie stag-\ning system, the ISS and revised (R)-ISS are frequently used\nas staging systems; in the latter systems, the β2-\nmicroglobulin and albumin levels reflect patients' tumor\nburden, turnover rate, presence of renal impairment, and\nnutritional and performance status.58In order to improve\nthe prognostic performance of the ISS score, the IMWG\nupdated it, adding high-risk cytogenetics [t(4;14), t(14;16),\nand del17p determined by interphase fluorescence in situ\nhybridization] and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase\n(Table 4).\n59 These factors had been previously identified as\nrelevant risk factors for early progression after autologous\ntransplantation.60 Of note, the ISS and R-ISS give prognos-\ntic information at diagnosis, but have not been validated\nin relapsed/refractory MM.\nFrailty and co-morbidities\nOnce a treatment has started, adherence to the estab-\nlished protocol remains a major clinical concern in elderly\nand frail patients. This requires an individualized\napproach in which therapeutic decisions should be driven\nby both disease features and the patient’s characteristics.\nAs in other malignancies, comprehensive geriatric assess-\nments have been evaluated to assess patients’ functional,\ncognitive and mental status, comorbidities, nutrition and\npresence of geriatric symptoms. Palumbo and co-workers\ndeveloped a retrospective simplified geriatric assessment,\nnamed the IMWG-Frailty Index, in which age, the\nCharlson Comorbidity Index, activities of daily living and\ninstrumental activities of daily living were used to dis-\ncriminate between fit, intermediate-fit and frail patients,\nshowing different incidences of severe adverse events,\nprogression-free survival and overall survival.61 Expectedly,\nmore severe adverse events and treatment discontinua-\ntions were reported in frail patients. The most extensive\nretrospective and prospective tests and validation analyses\nwere performed within the German study group, who\nprospectively assessed the IMWG-Frailty Index with the\nrevised Myeloma Comorbidity Index (R-MCI) and other\ncomorbidity indices.62 A second prospective German\nstudy including 801 MM patients determined that\nimpaired renal and pulmonary function, poorer Karnofsky\nperformance status, frailty and age were independent,\nmultivariate risk factors for overall survival. Addition of\ncytogentic abnormalities resulted in the weighted revised\nMyeloma Comorbidity Index, which is able to assess\npatients' physical condition accurately and is simple to\napply in the clinic.\n63Although not yet proven via random-\nized treatment algorithms, there is circumstantial evi-\ndence that limited induction therapy, careful dose modifi-\ncations and reductions, sensible use of supportive care and\nwatchful surveillance of unfit and frail patients may\nimprove patients’ outcome further.64 The EMN insists on\ndeveloping  trials, specifically designed for frail patients,\nfor further refinement of frailty-related diagnostics and\nbest treatment selection.\n65\nDrug-related biomarkers\nWhile prognostic factors regarding disease evaluation are\nlisted above, drug-related biomarkers are being assessed to\npredict response to treatment and, possibly, to facilitate\noptimal treatment while avoiding ineffective therapies and\nunnecessary toxicity. Recent pharmacogenomic studies\nrevealed gene signatures that could predict the clinical out-\ncome after treatments based on immunomodulatory drugs66\nor bortezomib.67The expression of cereblon, an intracellular\nbinding partner of immunomodulatory drugs has been\nintensively studied as a biomarker and initial studies corre-\nlated cereblon levels with the outcome of MM patients\nreceiving treatment with such drugs.68-71These studies used\nquantitative real time PCR analysis, gene expression profil-\ning or immunohistochemistry to quantify cereblon expres-\nsion and showed that loss of cereblon expression was asso-\nciated with resistance to immunomodulatory drugs. Further\ninvestigations revealed limitations of these assays, because\nboth splice variants of cereblon and point mutations were\ndescribed.\n72,73When exploring predictors for tumor respons-\nes to daratumumab, higher CD38 expression was found on\nMM cells of responsive patients. However, good responses\nwere also seen in patients with lower CD38 expression, an\nobservation confirmed in a second study that showed that\nCD38 expression level was not necessarily predictive of\nresponse in advanced MM; nevertheless attempts to assess\nagents that keep CD38 upregulation increased, e.g., all-trans\nretinoic acid and histone deacetylase inhibitors, are being\npursued pre-clinically and clinically.\n74,75\nFinally, expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL-2,\nBCL-XL or MCL-1, measured by quantitative real-time\nPCR, predict pharmacological responses to the bcl-2\ninhibitor venetoclax, which is mostly active in patients\nharboring t(11,14) translocations.76\nJ.

At least a minimal frailty assessment\nshould be performed to aid the choice of induction therapy, dose\namendments and supportive care. Although of interest due to their\nprognostic and predictive value, biomarkers, such as cereblon and\nCD38 protein expression, are not routinely assessed in daily multiple\nmyeloma care, while fluorescence in situ hybridization for t(11;14)\nshould be performed if treatment with venetoclax is a clinical option.\nResponse assessment\nThe implication of the results of an SFLC assay and MRD\nassessment prompted the IMWG to update MM response\ncriteria.77 In 2011, two new categories, stringent complete\nresponse and very good partial response, were added.\nCorrect disease assessment is not only crucial for reporting\nin clinical trials, it also indicates prognosis in individual\ncases.77,78It is well known that patients who obtain a com-\nplete response following induction have improved progres-\nsion-free and overall survival after intensive treatment.79\nPatients should, therefore, be evaluated before initiation\nof each treatment cycle to determine their response to ther-\napy. For MM patients with intact immunoglobulins, the\nrecommended method for monitoring is quantification of\nserum and urinary M-protein. Whether all serum (and\nurine) parameters have to be checked after each cycle,\nrather than after every two or three cycles is left to the dis-\ncretion of each physician, taking into account disease\naggressiveness, organ (i.e. renal) impairment and various\nother factors. To confirm a stringent complete response,\nnormalization of the SFLC values and disappearance of\nmonoclonal PC infiltration in the BM should be added to\nnegative immunofixation on serum and urine samples. The\nBM must be evaluated in order to confirm a complete\nresponse, but this can be done at some time after the end of\ntreatment, allowing full recovery of the BM. Of note, BM\ninfiltration can be heterogeneous with persisting focal\nlesions in an otherwise recovered BM (earlier referred to as\npatchy disease). The follow-up of patients with light-chain\nMM and measurable M-protein levels in urine should\ninclude 24 h urine collections. The SFLC assay generally\nallows response assessment in patients with oligosecretory\ndisease with unmeasurable serum and urine M-protein lev-\nels [serum M-protein <1 g/dL (10 g/L) or urine M-protein\n<200 mg/24 h]. If the SFLC assay is not informative, BM\nplasmacytosis should be assessed.\n77\nThe definition of relapse applies to a patient in complete\nresponse who experiences reappearance of MM, while pro-\ngression refers to patients with an increasing disease burden\nfrom a baseline or persistent residual disease. An additional\nassessment for confirmation is mandatory before initiating\na new line of therapy. MM progression can be determined\nbiochemically (increase in an existing monoclonal peak), or\nby radiological and clinical criteria. The interested reader\ncan find the criteria for relapse and disease progression\nrecently described by the IMWG.77 Response assessment\ncan be challenging, especially in cases of deep response after\nthe use of monoclonal antibodies, which may interfere\nwith quantification of the M-protein and may require spe-\ncific assays.80\nMinimal residual disease\nCurrent induction regimens, in association with autolo-\ngous stem cell transplantation, achieve very high\nresponse rates and the responses are often deep.\nUnfortunately, however, MM often recurs due to residual\nMM cells, drug resistance and/or persistence of resistant\ndormant subclones.81 MRD can be assessed by multipara-\nmeter flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-\nbased methods or next-generation sequencing to identify\npersistent clonal cells. Recent studies, listed in Table 5,\nconfirmed the prognostic impact of MRD status as an\nindependent variable for outcome.82 In the future, MRD\nwill be more widely used in clinical trials to guide treat-\nment choices and probably as a surrogate marker for pro-\ngression-free and overall survival.56\nConventional flow-MRD approaches, based on multi-\nple institutional non-standardized protocols, can reliably\nidentify malignant PC and discriminate aberrantly\nexpressed cell surface markers in approximately 90% of\npatients (with a sensitivity of detecting 10\n−4 atypical PC in\nnormal BM). Recent studies conducted by Spanish and\nUK groups have shown that negative MRD by multipara-\nmeter flow cytometry is predictive for both progression-\nfree survival and overall survival, even in patients who\nachieved a complete response.83,84 Recent technical\nadvances have increased the sensitivity of next-genera-\ntion flow cytometry protocols down to the 10–6 range.85 \nMRD analysis by PCR detects persistent residual tumor\ncells through the amplification of a tumor-specific molec-\nular marker. The IGH rearrangement is used as a marker\nof clonality in various B-cell malignancies.86 Allele-specific\noligonucleotide PCR with primers complementary to the\nheavy chain variable sequence remains one of the most\nsensitive approaches to detect residual malignant PC,\nreaching a sensitivity of 10−5.87 Unfortunately, it is a labo-\nrious, time-consuming approach that is not widely avail-\nable because of its dependence on patient-specific\nprimers and probes for quantitative PCR.\nNext-generation sequencing of the IGH rearrangement\nsegments provides insights into the architecture of the B-\nlineage repertoire with consensus primers. Since the B-\nlineage repertoire includes the malignant PC clone in BM,\nnext-generation sequencing of IGH enables a quantitative\ndetermination of MRD, without per-patient customiza-\ntion, provided that the malignant clone was identified in\na diagnostic sample or a sample taken during active dis-\nease.\n88 Results from next-generation sequencing are high-\nly concordant with flow-based MRD detection, highly\nreproducible and reach a sensitivity of 10−6.89-91 A lack of\nstandardization and limited commercial availability are\nthe main restraints for next-generation sequencing. Flow\ncytometry and molecular techniques both require an\nappropriate BM sample. Heterogeneous BM infiltration\nand peripheral blood dilution  can be major hurdles to the\nevaluation of MRD. Since neither of these techniques is\nable to detect extramedullary disease, they should be\ncombined with imaging studies. \nImaging is a third approach to evaluate MRD in MM.\nBoth PET/CT and MRI have been evaluated in this set-\nting.\n53,55Regarding PET/CT, two large studies assessed the\nprognostic value of negative PET/CT after induction and\nautologous stem cell transplantation.55,92Both studies\nfound that PET/CT-negative patients had a better pro-\ngression-free and overall survival compared to PET/CT-\npositive patients (52 versus38 months and 5-year esti-\nmates of 90% versus71%, respectively).92 In the French\nIMAJEM study, MRD was evaluated in 86 patients via\nPET-CT and flow cytometry.

A major advantage of PET/CT\nis its capacity to assess MRD outside the BM; its disadvan-\ntages are high cost and the lack of reimbursement in cer-\ntain countries, insufficient standardization and reduced\ntracer uptake in some MM patients. Evaluation via\nPET/CT has been incorporated into the new IMWG MRD\ncriteria.77 In the future, the increased capabilities of diffu-\nsion weighted MRI to detect small lesions and diffuse\ninfiltration may offer advantages that merit prospective\nevaluation in MRD assessment studies.50\nIn addition, recent studies have demonstrated that cir-\nculating DNA fragments carrying tumor-specific\nsequence alterations can be detected and quantified in the\nblood of patients with solid tumors.93,94 In MM, various\nstudies have provided evidence that - much like in solid\ntumors - MM-specific alterations (VDJ rearrangements or\nsomatic genomic alterations) can also be identified and\ntracked in cell-free DNA circulating in blood.95,96\nEuropean Myeloma Network recommendations: \nResponse assessment is an essential part of myeloma manage-\nment. Patients under treatment should be evaluated before the initi-\nation of each cycle and according to international guidelines.\nMinimal residual disease testing is not currently recommended in\nroutine follow-up of patients but is likely to be incorporated in stan-\ndard response/progression evaluation soon. Valid options for the\nassessment of minimal residual disease are based on bone marrow\ncells (next-generation flow cytometry) or molecular analysis (next-\ngeneration sequencing), often also combined with an imaging-based\nevaluation. These methods require appropriate expertise.\nConclusion\nWhile novel agents have certainly improved the out-\ncomes of patients with myeloma, prompt diagnosis and\nclose follow-up of MM patients remain highly relevant\nand contribute to better survival. In most cases, the diag-\nnosis of MM is straightforward, being based on biological\nand radiological evidence when evocative clinical signs\nare present. During response assessment, the evaluation\nof MRD will become increasingly important and, within\nthe next few years, will guide treatment choices in clinical\ntrials and possibly also outside trial scenarios.\nInternational efforts are needed to standardize the differ-\nent techniques that can be used to evaluate MRD.\nGuidelines on appropriate follow-up and patient-tailored\nmonitoring have been updated in this EMN consensus\npaper and should help to improve the outcome and prog-\nnosis of our patients.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank distinguished IMWG, EMN, DSMM\nand GMMG experts for their advice and recommendations that\nhave helped us to improve this paper.
