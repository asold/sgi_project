Introduction \nThe rapid development of technological advances has increased the importance of electricity in people's lives. With advances in household \nand industrial equipment technology that uses electrical energy as a power source, the need for the availability of electrical energy is \nincreasing, so it is necessary to develop a reliable system to distribute electrical energy from power plants to consumers. A transformer is \none of the essential equipment in the electric power system that is used to transmit electrical energy from one circuit to another that operates \nusing magnetic-electric induction [1]. \nInside the transformer, there is transformer oil which functions as an insulating medium and coolant in the central part of the transformer. \nTransformer oil is a cooling medium that anticipates the temperature rise in the transformer. The existence of an excessive temperature rise \ncan damage the paper insulation on the coil (coil) inside the transformer. Damage to the insulation of transformer oil is caused by a change \nin temperature load or ambient temperature (ambient temperature) in the power transformer. Heating the transformer windings can damage \nthe insulation, and an increase in oil temperature will change the composition and properties of the transformer oil. If this change is allowed, \nit can cause the insulating value of the oil to decrease [2]. \nThe heat generated by the conductor can cause the insulation temperature to rise above its maximum temperature. If this heating condition \ncontinues, the insulation can deteriorate and cause insulation failure, which can cause insulation breakdown. The content in the transformer \noil can cause this condition to be contaminated with particles and moisture. In a transformer, to avoid insulation failure, it is necessary to \nknow the working capacity of the insulation used [3]. \nExcessive loading can cause the transformer oil to expand and emit gases dissolved in the oil. These gases will then precipitate and become \ncontaminated with oil, thereby reducing the insulating ability of the oil. Transformer conditions can be maintained or improved by knowing \nthe quality of transformer oil. Different loading levels can result in the  emergence of dissolved gases in the transformer oil. Some of the \ngases that arise are flammable (combustible). If these gases exceed the solubility limit in transformer oil, it will cause interference with the \noperating transformer [4]. \n2. Literature Review \n2.1. Transformer \nA transformer is a static electromagnetic device used to transfer/change electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another. Transformer \nreliability must be respected to maintain high performance. In addition to its important role, the transformer is also said t o be the most \nInternational Journal of Engineering, Science & InformationTechnology (IJESTY) \nVolume 2, No. 4 (2022) pp. 119-126 \nISSN 2775-2674 (online) \nWebsite: http://ijesty.org/index.php/ijesty \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.52088/ijesty.v1i4.380 \nResearch Paper, Short Communication, Review, Technical Paper \n \n\n120 International Journal of Engineering, Science & Information Technology, 2 (4), 2022, pp. 119-126 \n \nexpensive asset in the distribution of electric power, so that regular mai ntenance of the transformer is considered more effective and \nefficient from an economic point of view compared to replacing the transformer [5]. \nTransformers are used with much precision, both in the fields of electric power and electronics. In the case of using a trans former power \nsystem, every need can be met with an appropriate and economical voltage for each need, such as when distributing electric power over \nlong distances. It is important to note that alternating current is often used for the generation and distribution of electri c power, so that in \nthe use of a simple and reliable transformer it is possible to choose the appropriate and economical voltage for each need [6]. \nThe working principle of the transformer is based on Ampere's law and the law Faraday, who stated that magnets can attract electricity and \nvice versa. If the coil on the transformer has alternating current, the number of magnetic lines of force will change. As a result, on the \nprimary side, induction occurs. The secondary side gets a magnetic force line from the primary side which is also quite a lot . So on the \nsecondary side there is also induction, as a result there is a voltage difference between the two ends and the equation obtained can be seen \nin equation 1 below:[6] \n \n            (1) \nThe type of oil that is often used as insulating oil at PLN is mineral oil, mineral oil is oil made from petroleum processing, namely between \nthe diesel and turbine oil fractions which have a very complex chemical structure. This insulating oil resulting from distillation still has to \nbe modified so that it has high insulation resistance, good heat stability, and meets other technical requirements. Dielectri c strength is a \nmeasure of a material's ability to withstand high stresses without causing dielectric failure. Based on data obtained on 9 January 2021 from \nthe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Indonesia, it is stated that oil reserves in Indonesia will b e exhausted \nwithin 9.5 years assuming no new reserves are discovered in the future. Various efforts have been made to reduce the use of mineral oil, \nwhere its availability is very limited, non-renewable also has weaknesses including not being degraded so that it can cause environmental \npollution[7]. \n2.2. Transformer Oil \nTransformer oil is a liquid insulating material used as insulation and cooler on the transformer. Most of the insulating material oil must \nhave the ability to withstand breakdown voltage, whereas as transformer oil cooler should able to dissipate that heat generated[8].  \nThe increase in temperature at excessiv e loading on the transformer will result in a heating effect. Any increase in temperature above the \nlimit of 6ºC causes the life of the transformer to age. In Indonesia, based on SPLN, transformers can only operate at tempera tures below \n40ºC with an average daily and annual temperature of around 30ºC. According to the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) the \nlife of the transformer is only around 20 years[2]. \nInsulation failure can occur due to several main factors, including aging insulation, decreased dielectric strength, and overvoltage on the \ninsulation. In addition, other factors that can cause insulation failure are the distance between the electrodes, the area of the electrodes, and \nthe cooling system[9]. \nGood insulating oil has a good dielectric value and breakdown voltage value. Breakdown voltage is an electric voltage when an  insulator \ncannot face the electric field pressure on an electrode that has a potential difference so that the insulator is no longer able to isolate or can \nturn into a conductor. When the value of the breakdown voltage is small then there is interference. The disturbance that occu rs in the \ninsulating oil of the transformer can be influenced by several things, one of which is due to the presence of contaminants in the insulating \noil. These contaminants are usually in the form of liquid contaminants, the presence of water in the insulating oil is caused  by several \nexternal and internal factors such as, when it rains, the water can enter the transformer, and when the temperature inside the transformer is \nhigh while the temperature around the transformer is lower or otherwise it will result in the presence of water vapor[10]. \nThe requirements for transformer oil as insulation are as follows[11]: \n1. Low viscosity to facilitate circulation \n2. High flash point to prevent fire \n3. Acid free to prevent rust of copper and damage to windings. \n4. Not corrosive \n5. Resistant to oxidation \n6. Has a high dielectric strength (breakdown voltage). \n7. Does not contain sediment (P3B, 2003) \n \n2.3. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) \nDissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is one of the tests on the oil transformer that aims to Find out the dissolved gases in the oil transformers \nare generally gas such could not be detected on the test oil characteristics. Gas monitoring dissolved aims to determine the type failure of \ntransformer oil, and prevent the transformer from burning due to flammable gases. Test result DGA in the form of hydrogen gas, methane, \ncarbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene will rise with the resulting transformer temperature increases transformer \noverload and loss. This heat can trigger the acceleration of the reaction hydrocarbons in transformer oil especially rising ethane and ethylene \ngases which is usually caused by hot metal. According to (IEEE Std C57.104-1991), there is some methods that need to be done in interpret \nand analyze data based on the test results of the DGA obtained, namely TDCG (Total Dissolved Combustible Gas), Key Gas, Roger's Ratio, \nand Duval's Triangle[12]. \n \n2.4. Arduino Uno \nThe ubiquitous use of microcontrollers in automobiles, robotics, and industrial systems has made their research important. An Arduino \nboard includes a microcontroller and other features that make programming and debugging simple  . An engineer only needs to install the \nArduino IDE, which is available online at www.arduino.cc , on his computer, write the program, compile it, and load it into the board . \nThere is no nee d for an additional programmer. Its functions are simple to grasp, which makes it ideal for inventor prototyping. The C \nprogramming language is used by Arduino[13]. \n\nInternational Journal of Engineering, Science & Information Technology, 2 (4), 2022, pp. 119-126 121 \n \n \nFg 1. Arduino Pin Configuration \n2.4. Arduino IDE \nThe Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) is software that allows you to create programs on a computer and upload them to \nthe Arduino physical board. To demonstrate the design, the program began with the Arduino IDE software. The Arduino IDE simpl ifies \nthe process of writing and uploading code to the Arduino Uno. The Arduino IDE software includes a program  editor, compiler, and up-\nloader[14]. \n1. Program editor : a window that functions to write and edit programs. \n2. Compiler : functions to check whether there are error’s or not in the program code that has been made. \n3. Uploader : functions to upload (upload) the program results made to the Arduino board. \n \n \n \nFg 2. Display of the Arduino IDE Software \n2.4. MG-811 Sensor \nThe MG-811 sensor is a sensor that can detect carbon dioxide (CO2) gas with high sensitivity in a room. This sensor can detect effective \nconcentrations of CO2 gas at concentrations of 350-10000 ppm. MG-811 can perform detection at temperatures of -20-50oC.  This sensor \nwill be active when a voltage is applied to the vcc pin of 6V either at AC or DC voltage. This sensor also has a heater or heater that requires \na voltage of 6V to work[15]. \n \nFg 3. MG-811 Sensor Structure \n2.4. MQ-6 Sensor \nThe MQ-6 sensor is a gas sensor that is commonly used to detect LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) gas. This sensor can also detect ethan e \ngas, because LPG contains 40% ethane gas [16]. The sensitive material of the MQ -6 sensor is SnO2, which has a lower conductivity in \nclean air. When fla mmable gas is present, the sensor conductivity is higher with increasing gas concentration. This sensor can detect \nconcentrations on sensors of 200-10000 ppm. MQ-6 can perform detection at a temperature of 20oC with a tolerance limit of ± 2oC[17]. \n \nFg 4. MQ-6 Sensor Module \n\n122 International Journal of Engineering, Science & Information Technology, 2 (4), 2022, pp. 119-126 \n \n2.5. MQ-2 Sensor \nThe MQ-2 sensor is a gas sensor that is commonly used to detect LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) gas. This sensor can also detect ethylene \ngas, because LPG contains 10% ethylene gas [16]. MQ-2 resistance value is different for various types and various gas concentrations. \nWhen using this component, sensitivity adjustment is necessary. Calibrate the detector for 1000 ppm liquefied petroleum gas. When meas-\nuring accurately, the proper alarm point for the gas detector must be determined after considering the influence of temperature and humid-\nity[18].  \n \nFg 5. MQ-2 Sensor Module \n2.6. DS18B20 Sensor \nThe DS18B20 sensor is the latest digital temperature sensor in the Maxim IC series. This sensor can read temperatures with 9-bit to 12-bit \naccuracy in the range of -55oC to 125oC (+/-0.5oC). Each sensor produced has a unique 64-bit code embedded on each chip, enabling the \nuse of a large number of sensors via a single wire (single wire data bus/1-wire protocol). Fg 6, a) displays the physical form of the DS18B20 \nsensor and b) block diagram of the DS18B20 sensor[19]. \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFg 6. Physical Form and DS18B20 Sensor Block Diagram \n \n \n2.7. LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) \nLCD (Liquid Cristal Display) is an important component because the LCD can display commands that must be executed. The LCD screen \nuses two polarizing weight sheets and a liquid crystal between the two sheets. LCD is widely used in designing a system using a micro-\ncontroller. The 16x2 LCD has 16 PINs, where each pin has a symbol and also its functions. This 16x2 LCD operates on a +5V power \nsupply but can also run a +3V depower supply. This 16x2 LCD has two important parts: the backlight, which is useful when used at night, \nand the contrast, which serves to sharpen the display. Here is a picture of a 16x2 LCD[20]. \n \nFg 7. LCD I2C size 16x2 \n3. Method \nIn this study the authors used a gradual research method consisting of certain steps, procedures and techniques. Some of the initial stages \nin carrying out this research are as follows. \n\nInternational Journal of Engineering, Science & Information Technology, 2 (4), 2022, pp. 119-126 123 \n \n3.1. Gas Detector Working System \nThis design presents a variety of data in the form of numbers. Before making the program, the working order of the tool and all components \nare needed to be connected to form a system of gas detection devices in transformer oil. The system f low chart for the transformer oil gas \ndetector is as follows: \nFg 8. Tool Working Diagram \nThe flow chart above uses the tool starting from taking transformer oil samples. At this stage there is a sensor circuit that  functions as a \nvoltage value detector. Furthermore, these values will detect gas contained in the transformer oil. The voltage value will be processed on \nArduino, and the results of the detection will be displayed on the LCD on this device. \n3.2.

This \ntest tends to pay more attention to the output results displayed on the I2C LCD. \nFg 10. Overall Testing \n4.

The levels of \ncarbon dioxide gas in transformer oil read from 328 ppm to 489 ppm, ethane gas from 28 ppm to 41 ppm, ethylene gas from 21 ppm to 32 \nppm. Based on the overall test results table, the gas content in transformer oil continues to increase continuously. \n5. Conclusion  \nBased on the results of testing and discussion on the design of the detectors for carbon dioxide (CO2), ethane (C2H6), and ethylene (C2H6) \ngas levels in transformer oil that have been made, conclusions can be drawn, namely: \n1. At the time of testing, the temperature of the transformer oil increased which resulted in the gas content in the transformer oil also \nincreasing. \n2. According to key gas analysis, ethylene gas can cause overheating of oil if the gas content in ethylene is 63%, ethane is 20%.  \n3. In the study using prototype sensors to detect ethane and ethylene gases. The sensor is not a sensor specifically for detecting the two \ngases. Researchers took the percentage value of each gas detected for LPG gas which is the main function of the two sensors, in LPG \ngas there is 40% ethane gas and 10% ethylene gas. \nReferences  \n[1] S.
