  "abstract": "The R-W test is a tool examining the speed and accuracy of thinking used in labor psychology. It is described as a tool „filled with the intellectual component”, however, there is no validation data in the literature confirming that the R-W test exam some aspect of intellectual abilities. To fill this gap, validation studies were conducted. In the first one, conducted on a group of drivers (N=105), the R-W test relationship with the complex reaction time, attention, as well as the participants level of education were revealed. In study 2 conducted on a group of students (N=150) the relationship between the R-W test and fluid intelligence, perceptivity and attention, as well as anxiety as a trait and as a state were revealed. The obtained results confirm our assumptions that performing the R-W test requires the use of fluid intelligence resources. Key words: labor psychology, transportation psychology, intelligence, screening tests",
