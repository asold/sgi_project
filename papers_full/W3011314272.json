We present an enhanced AC Optimal\nPower Flow (OPF) model that estimates dynamic Distribution\nnodal Location Marginal Costs (DLMCs) encompassing trans-\nformer degradation as a short-run network variable cost. We de-\ncompose real/reactive power DLMCs into additive marginal cost\ncomponents representing respectively the costs of real/reactive\npower transactions at the T&D interface, real/reactive power\nmarginal losses, voltage and ampacity congestion, and trans-\nformer degradation, capturing intertemporal coupling. Decom-\nposition is useful in identifying sources of marginal costs and\nfacilitating the employment of distributed AC OPF algorithms.\nDLMCs convey sufﬁcient information to represent the beneﬁt\nof shifting real/reactive power across time and achieve optimal\nDistribution Network and DER operation. We present and ana-\nlyze actual distribution feeder based numerical results involving\na wealth of future EV/PV adoption scenarios and illustrate the\nsuperiority of our approach relative to reasonable conventional\nscheduling alternatives. Overwhelming evidence from extensive\nnumerical results supports the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of internalizing\nshort-run marginal asset —primarily transformer— degradation.\nIndex Terms—Distribution Locational Marginal Costs, Dis-\ntributed Energy Resources, Marginal Transformer Degradation.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nR\nAPIDLY growing adoption of Distributed Energy Re-\nsources (DERs), including clean, albeit volatile, renew-\nable generation, storage and ﬂexible loads with storage-like\nproperties and V olt/V AR control capabilities, e.g., Electric\nVehicles (EVs) and Solar Photovoltaic (PV) inverters, present\na major challenge together with still unexploited opportunities.\nNumerous studies on DER integration [1]–[9] address the\nimpact of various DERs (primarily EVs and PVs) on the\nDistribution Network and its assets, e.g., overvoltages due\nto PV , and explore DER capabilities, e.g., the provision of\nreactive power. Interestingly, several works investigate the im-\npact of increasing EV penetration on distribution transformers\n[2]–[6], noting that transformer aging is dependent upon the\nthermal effects of persistent loading. Indeed, the transformer\nlife is strongly related to its winding hottest spot tempera-\nture (HST) driving insulation aging; assuming operation at\na reference HST, it may exceed 20 years. IEEE C.57.91-\n2011 [10] and IEC 60076-7:2018 [11] standards provide an\nexponential representation of the aging acceleration factor,\nP. Andrianesis and M. Caramanis are with the Systems Eng. Div., Boston\nUniversity, Boston, MA: panosa@bu.edu, mcaraman@bu.edu. Research par-\ntially supported by Sloan Foundation G-2017-9723 and NSF AitF 1733827.\nwhich is greater (less) than 1 for HSTs exceeding (being\nlower than) 110oC. Early EV pilot studies [12] identiﬁed\nthat clustering EV chargers under the same transformer may\ncause damage from persistent overloading. A recent study for\nthe Sacramento Municipal Utility District [13] estimated that\nabout 26% of the substations and service transformers would\nexperience overvoltages due to PVs, whereas up to 17% of the\napproximately 12,000 service transformers would experience\noverloads due to EVs and would need to be replaced at an\naverage estimated cost of $7,400 per transformer.\nThere is also an emerging literature that extends whole-\nsale Locational Marginal Price (LMP) markets to distribution\nnetworks through reliance on Distribution LMPs (DLMPs).\nThis paper argues that most published work is lacking in\nconsidering the daily cycle costs of distribution networks and\ncomplex DER preferences that are inadequately represented by\nuniform price quantity bids/offers. Indeed, past work has paid\ninsufﬁcient attention to Grid-DER co-optimization and the\nrole of economically efﬁcient Distribution Locational Marginal\nCosts (DLMCs) that go beyond wholesale market LMPs\nby internalizing intertemporally coupled DER preferences,\ne.g., energy rather than capacity demanding EVs, and salient\ndistribution network costs, e.g., transformer Loss of Life\n(LoL). The considerable time elapsed between the proposal\nof wholesale power markets in the 80s [14], [15] and their\neventual extensive and successful implementation in the late\n90s, behooves us to redouble our effort in the appropriate\nmodeling and estimation of DLMCs. The expected shock\nthat distributed generation and mobile EV battery charging\nwill most likely deliver to distribution assets (transformers\nin particular) may dwarf the shock delivered in the late\n70s by the massive adoption of air-conditioning. What costs\nshould DLMCs capture to promote efﬁcient scheduling of EV\ncharging and dual use of PV smart inverters?\nExisting literature investigating the EV impact on distribu-\ntion transformers [2]–[6] includes mostly simulation studies\nassessing the impact of various charging schedules on trans-\nformer LoL. Indicative results show that the daily LoL of\na residential service transformer may almost double if EVs\ncharge upon arrival [6], and that “open-loop” EV charging,\ne.g., delay until after midnight that may be promoted by\nTime of Use rates, can actually increase, rather than decrease,\ntransformer aging [3]. Rooftop PVs, on the other hand, can\nutilize their inverters to mitigate overvoltage issues and most\nimportantly to schedule their real and reactive power output\nwith a beneﬁcial impact on transformer LoL. Indeed, [7]\nshows that high PV penetration can signiﬁcantly extend the life\nof distribution transformers in a suburban area. Furthermore,\narXiv:1811.09001v3  [math.OC]  24 Dec 2020\n2\nwhile previous research determined insigniﬁcant synergy be-\ntween the substation transformer LoL and charging EVs in\nthe presence of rooftop PV (due to non-coincidence between\npeak hours of PV generation and EV charging), [8] shows that\nthe transformer thermal time constant allows PV generation to\nreduce the HST when EVs are charging.\nAlthough the above works consider the DER impact on\ntransformer aging, they do not internalize degradation to the\noperational planning problem. A ﬁrst outline is provided in\n[16]–[18], among the ﬁrst DLMP works in which a transformer\nmodel is employed in AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) with\nnonlinear LoL objective function components and omission of\nthe thermal time constant intertemporal coupling. These works\nemploy the branch ﬂow (a.k.a. DistFlow) equations, introduced\nfor radial networks by [19], and their relaxation to convex Sec-\nond Order Cone constraints proposed by [20]. Parallel works\n[21], [22] determined DLMPs using DC OPF, considering\nprice-taking EV aggregators. Quadratic programming is used\nin [22], as opposed to linear programming in [21], to derive\nDLMPs that are announced to EV and heat pump aggrega-\ntors optimizing their energy plans. DLMP approaches using\nlinearized models are discussed in [23], whereas [24] also\nemploys a trust-region method. Following [16], [25] employs\nthe relaxed DistFlow model and proposes a day-ahead frame-\nwork, in which DERs bid into a distribution-level electricity\nmarket. It acknowledges that reactive power and voltage are\ncritical features in distribution network operation, and, hence,\nDC OPF approaches are inadequate in capturing signiﬁcant\ncosts. DLMPs are derived using sensitivity factors of the\nlinear version of the DistFlow model; they include ampacity\ncongestion but do not consider the impact on transformers. In\na parallel to [25], [26] provides a comprehensive analysis of\nvarious approaches in decomposing and interpreting DLMPs,\nand discusses accuracy and computational aspects.\nOur main objective is to derive the time and location\nspeciﬁc marginal costs of real and reactive power in the\ndistribution network that are consistent with the optimal DER\nschedule in the day-ahead operational planning problem. We\naim at discovering DLMCs and understanding the components,\nbuilding blocks, and sources that constitute the marginal costs.\nEven more importantly, this decomposition enables scaling to\nreal distribution feeders by leveraging distributed algorithms\nrequiring a simple day-ahead AC OPF solution conditional\nupon given DER schedules to derive tentative DLMCs that\ndrive individual daily operational DER scheduling. The main\ncontributions are three-fold.\nFirst, we present an enhanced AC OPF model that includes\na detailed cost representation of transformer degradation in the\npresence of DERs (PVs, EVs). More speciﬁcally, we enhance\nthe relaxed branch ﬂow model with accurate modeling of the\ntransformer LoL and intertemporal thermal response. Second,\nwe provide intuitive formulas of the real and reactive power\nDLMC component representing transformer degradation cost.\nEmploying sensitivity analysis, we decompose DLMCs into\nadditive cost components, based on the cost of real and reactive\npower at the substation, real and reactive power marginal\nlosses, voltage congestion, line (ampacity) congestion, and\ntransformer degradation. We illustrate how the last component\ncaptures the intertemporal impact of the thermal response\ndynamics on the marginal cost and quantify this impact by\nshowing how the transformer load at a speciﬁc hour affects\nfuture hour degradation marginal costs. We also discuss prac-\ntical considerations for capturing the transformer degradation\nimpact that extends beyond the day-ahead horizon. Third,\nwe employ an actual distribution feeder and a wealth of\nfuture DER adoption scenarios, and we compare to approaches\nthat are often considered reasonable (Business as Usual, time\nvarying LMPs that do not vary across distribution nodes,\nand traditional Line Loss minimization). Extensive numerical\nresults illustrate the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of internalizing short-\nrun marginal asset, primarily transformer, degradation, and\nthat voltage and ampacity congestion DLMC components are\ninsufﬁcient in providing the price signal that supports the\nsystem optimal schedules. They also demonstrate that apart\nfrom optimal short-run scheduling, our approach can harvest\notherwise idle DER reactive power compensation capabilities,\nand increase distribution network DER (EV/PV) hosting ca-\npacity mitigating investments in distribution infrastructure.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section\nII introduces the enhanced AC OPF model. Section III presents\nthe decomposition of DLMCs. Section IV discusses the case\nstudy based numerical ﬁndings. Section V concludes and\nprovides further research directions.\nII. E NHANCED AC OPF M ODEL\nIn this section, we introduce the network and DER models\n(Subsection II-A), we present the detailed transformer degra-\ndation formulation (Subsection II-B), and we summarize the\nenhanced AC OPF problem (Subsection II-C) for clarity.\nA. Network and DER Models\nWe consider a radial network with N + 1 nodes and N\nlines. Let N= {0,1,...,N }be the set of nodes, with node 0\nrepresenting the root node, and N+ ≡N\\{ 0}. Let Lbe the\nset of lines, with each line denoted by the pair of nodes (i,j) it\nconnects — henceforth ij for short, where node irefers to the\n(unique due to the radial structure) preceding node of j ∈N+.\nTransformers are represented as a subset of lines, denoted by\ny∈Y⊂L . For node i∈N, vi denotes the magnitude squared\nvoltage. For node j ∈N+, pj and qj denote the net demand\nof real and reactive power, respectively. A positive (negative)\nvalue of pj refers to withdrawal (injection); similarly for qj.\nNet injections at the root node are denoted by P0 and Q0,\nfor real and reactive power, respectively. These are positive\n(negative) when power is ﬂowing from (to) the transmission\nsystem. For each line ij, with resistance rij and reactance\nxij, lij denotes the magnitude squared current, Pij and Qij\nthe sending-end real and reactive power ﬂow, respectively.\nThe branch ﬂow (AC power ﬂow) equations, are listed\nbelow, where we introduce the time index t; unless otherwise\nmentioned, j ∈N +, and t ∈T +, with T = {0,1,...,T },\nT+ ≡T\\{ 0}, and T the length of the optimization horizon.\nP0,t = P01,t →(λP\n0,t), Q 0,t = Q01,t →(λQ\n0,t), ∀t, (1)\nPij,t −rijlij,t =\n∑\nk:j→k\nPjk,t + pj,t →(λP\nj,t), ∀j,t, (2)\n3\nQij,t −xijlij,t =\n∑\nk:j→k\nQjk,t + qj,t →(λQ\nj,t), ∀j,t, (3)\nvj,t = vi,t−2rijPij,t−2xijQij,t+\n(\nr2\nij + x2\nij\n)\nlij,t, ∀j,t, (4)\nvi,tlij,t = P2\nij,t + Q2\nij,t ∀j,t. (5)\nBrieﬂy, (1)–(3) deﬁne the real and reactive power balance,\n(4) the voltage drop, and (5) the apparent power but can be\nalso viewed as the deﬁnition of the current. The real (reactive)\npower net demand pj,t (qj,t) includes the aggregate effect of:\n(i) conventional demand consumption pd,t (qd,t) of load d ∈\nDj, where Dj ⊂D is the subset of loads (set D) connected\nat node j; ( ii) consumption pe,t (qe,t) of EV e∈Ej,t, where\nEj,t ⊂E is the subset of EVs (set E) that are connected at\nnode j, during time period t, and ( iii) generation ps,t (qs,t)\nof PV (rooftop solar) s∈Sj, where Sj ⊂S is the subset of\nPVs (set S) connected at node j. For clarity, the deﬁnitions\nof aggregate dependent variables are listed below:\npj,t =\n∑\nd∈Dj\npd,t +\n∑\ne∈Ej,t\npe,t −\n∑\ns∈Sj\nps,t, ∀j,t, (6)\nqj,t =\n∑\nd∈Dj\nqd,t +\n∑\ne∈Ej,t\nqe,t −\n∑\ns∈Sj\nqs,t, ∀j,t. (7)\nWe also supplement with voltage and current limits:\nvi ≤vi,t ≤¯vi →(µi,t,¯µi,t), ∀i,t, (8)\nlij,t ≤¯lij →(¯νj,t), ∀j,t, (9)\nwhere vi, ¯vi, and ¯lij are the lower voltage, upper voltage, and\nline ampacity limits (squared), respectively. Dual variables of\nconstraints (1)–(3), (8) and (9) are shown in parentheses.\nLastly, we provide PV and EV constraints for a general\nmulti-period operational planning problem setting, accommo-\ndating smart inverter capabilities and EV mobility.\nConsider a PV with nameplate capacity Cs, irradiation level\nρt ∈[0,1], and TI ⊂T + the subset of time periods for which\nρt >0. PV constraints ( ∀s∈S) are as follows:\nps,t ≤ρtCs, p 2\ns,t + q2\ns,t ≤C2\ns, ∀s,t ∈TI, (10)\nps,t = qs,t = 0, ∀s,t ̸∈TI, (11)\nwith ps,t ≥ 0. Constraints (10) impose limits on real and\napparent power (implicitly assuming an appropriately sized\ninverter), whereas (11) imposes zero generation when ρt = 0.\nConsider an EV connected for Z intervals, at nodes\nj1,...,j Z. Let Tbeg = {τbeg\nz }(Tend = {τend\nz }) be the set\nof time periods of interval z, for z = 1 ,...,Z , denoting an\nadjusted beginning (end), considering the part of the interval\nwithin the time horizon. Let Tz = {τbeg\nz + 1,...,τ end\nz }be\nthe set of time periods of interval z, during which the EV is\nconnected at node jz. The State of Charge (SoC), ue,t, for EV\ne, t∈T beg\ne ∪Tend\ne (index ewas omitted earlier for simplicity),\nis reduced by ∆uz,e after departure z and until arrival z+ 1,\nfor z= 1,..,Z e −1. EV constraints ( ∀e∈E) are as follows:\nue,τendz\n= ue,τbeg\nz\n+\n∑\nt∈Te,z\npe,t, ∀e,z = 1,...,Z e, (12)\nue,τbeg\nz+1\n= ue,τendz\n−∆ue,z, ∀e,z = 1,...,Z e −1, (13)\nue,τbeg\n1\n= uinit\ne , u min\ne,t ≤ue,t ≤CB\ne , ∀e,t ∈T end\ne , (14)\np2\ne,t + q2\ne,t ≤C2\ne, 0 ≤pe,t ≤Cr, ∀e,t ∈∪Ze\nz=1Te,z, (15)\npe,t = qe,t = 0, ∀e,t ∈T + \\∪Ze\nz=1Te,z, (16)\nwith pe,t,ue,t ≥ 0. Eqs. (12) and (13) deﬁne the SoC\nat the end/beginning of an interval, after charging/traveling,\nrespectively. Constraints (14) initialize the SoC ( uinit\ne ) at τbeg\n1\nand impose a minimum SoC, umin\ne,t , at the end of an interval as\nwell as the limit of the EV battery capacity, CB\ne . Constraints\n(15) impose the limits of the charger, Ce, (related to the size\nof the inverter) and the charging rate, Cr, (related to the\ncapacity of the EV battery charger). Lastly, (16) imposes zero\nconsumption when the EV is not plugged in.\nB. Transformer Degradation Formulation\nIEEE and IEC Standards [10], [11] provide detailed for-\nmulas on the transformer thermal response, widely used in\nsimulation studies, but not employed in an AC OPF model.\nFor a given HST of the winding, θH, they deﬁne the aging\nacceleration factor as FAA = exp\n(15000\n383 − 15000\nθH+273\n)\n. We\nconsider a piecewise linear approximation, ˜FAA, given by:\n˜FAA = aκθH −bκ, θH\nκ−1 ≤θH <θH\nκ , κ= 1,...,M, (17)\nwhere M is the number of segments. Notably, appropriate\nselection of the breakpoints ensures a highly accurate repre-\nsentation of the exponential aging model. Introducing indicesy\nand t, and substituting ˜FAA with fy,t to simplify the notation,\nwe replace (17) with the following set of inequalities:\nfy,t ≥aκθH\ny,t −bκ, ∀y,t,κ, (18)\nwith fy,t ≥0. Since fy,t will be included with a cost in the\nobjective function, at least one of these inequalities should\nbe binding, and hence, the relaxation of (17) to the linear\ninequality constraints (18), which would otherwise require the\nintroduction of binary variables, is exact.\nThe transformer HST, θH\ny,t, is given by:\nθH\ny,t = θA\ny,t + ∆θTO\ny,t + ∆θH\ny,t = θTO\ny,t + ∆θH\ny,t, (19)\nwhere θA\ny,t is the ambient temperature at the transformer\nlocation, θTO\ny,t is the top-oil (TO) temperature, ∆θTO\ny,t is the\nTO temperature rise over θA\ny,t, and ∆θH\ny,t is the winding HST\nrise over θTO\ny,t . The detailed derivations are based on the heat\ntransfer differential equations, and they are described in [11] as\na function of time, for varying load and ambient temperature,\nusing exponential and difference equations.\nFor the TO temperature, θTO\nt (we dropped index y), the\ndifferential equation is given by:\n∆¯θTO\n(1 + K2\ntR\n1 + R\n)n\n= k1τTO dθTO\nt\ndt + θTO\nt −θA\nt , (20)\nwhere ∆¯θTO is the rise of TO temperature over ambient\ntemperature at rated load, Kt is the ratio of the (current) load\nto the rated load, R is the ratio of load losses at rated load to\nno-load losses, τTO is the oil time constant with recommended\nvalue 3 hours, k1 and n are constants with recommended\nvalues 1 and 0.8, respectively. Since the granularity of our\n4\nproblem is less than half the recommended value of τTO\n(∆t= 1 hour), employing the difference equations, we get:\nθTO\nt = δθTO\nt−1 + (1 −δ)\n[\n∆¯θTO\n(1 + K2\ntR\n1 + R\n)n\n+ θA\nt\n]\n, (21)\nwhere δ = k1τTO\nk1τTO +∆t. For the winding HST rise over θTO\nt ,\n∆θH\nt , it can be shown that [10] and [11] yield the same results\nfor distribution (small) transformers. Because the winding time\nconstant τw has an indicative value of about 4 min (much\nless than the hourly granularity), the transient behavior 1 −\nexp\n(\n−∆t\nτw\n)\n≈1, vanishes. Hence, using [10], we get:\n∆θH\nt = ∆¯θH(\nK2\nt\n)m\n, (22)\nwhere ∆¯θH is the rise of HST over TO temperature at rated\nload, and m is a constant with recommended value 0.8.\nThe load ratio Kt can be deﬁned w.r.t. the transformer\nnominal current (at rated load), denoted by IN. Using vari-\nables lt (omitting index y), we have K2\nt = lt/lN, where\nlN = ( IN)2. Hence, approximating the terms\n(\n1+K2\nt R\n1+R\n)n\nand\n(\nK2\nt\n)m\nin (21) and (22), respectively, using the 1st order\nTaylor expansion of K2\nt around 1, equivalently of lt around\nlN — one can select a different point at each time period\ndepending on the anticipated loading conditions, and replacing\nK2\nt by lt/lN, we get\n(\n1+Kt\n2R\n1+R\n)n\n≈ nR\n(1+R)\nlt\nlN + 1+(1−n)R\n1+R ,(\nK2\nt\n)m\n≈mlt\nlN + 1 −m, and (21) and (22) yield:\nθTO\nt = δθTO\nt−1 + (1 −δ)nR∆¯θTO\n1 + R\nlt\nlN\n+ (1 −δ)\n[1 + (1−n)R\n1 + R ∆¯θTO + θA\nt\n]\n,\n(23)\n∆θH\nt = m∆¯θH lt\nlN + (1 −m)∆¯θH. (24)\nWe highlight two important features that greatly facilitate\nthe accurate representation of the transformer thermal re-\nsponse. The ﬁrst feature is related to the hourly granularity\nof the operational planning problem. Both θTO\ny,t and ∆θH\ny,t are\ncharacterized by thermal time constants, whose typical values\n(about 3 hours for the oil and about 4 minutes for the winding),\nallow us to employ difference equations for the oil whereas\nassume a steady state for the winding. Notably, this would still\nhold if we allowed up to a 15-min granularity. The second\nfeature is related to the magnitude squared current variable,\nly,t, of the branch ﬂow model, which allows us to deﬁne the\nsquare of the ratio of the transformer load to the rated load\nusing ly,t and the nominal (at rated load) current squared,\ndenoted by lN\ny . Hence, the equations that deﬁne the HST ﬁt\nnicely with the branch ﬂow model.\nCombining (19) and (24), we deﬁne θH\ny,t as a linear equation\nwith variables θTO\ny,t and ly,t. Substituting θTO\ny,t with hy,t, to\nsimplify the notation, and replacing θH\ny,t in (18), we get:\nfy,t ≥ακhy,t + βy,κly,t + γy,κ →(ξy,t,κ), ∀y,t,κ, (25)\nwith fy,t ≥0, ξy,t,κ the dual variable, and coefﬁcients ακ,\nβy,κ, γy,κ obtained directly from (18) and (24), with recom-\nmended values ακ = aκ, βy,κ = aκ\n4∆¯θH\ny\n5lNy\n, γy,κ = aκ\n∆¯θH\ny\n5 −bκ.\nThe TO temperature at time period t, θTO\ny,t , is in turn deﬁned\nby a linear recursive equation that includes the TO temperature\nat time period t−1, θTO\ny,t−1, and ly,t. Indeed, there is also an\nimpact of the ambient temperature, θA\ny,t, but this is in fact an\ninput parameter. Substituting θTO\ny,t with hy,t in (23), we get:\nhy,t = δhy,t−1 + ϵyly,t + ζy,t, ∀y,t, (26)\nwhere the coefﬁcients δ, ϵy, and ζy,t are obtained directly\nfrom (23), with recommended values δ= 3\n4 , ϵy =\nRy∆¯θTO\ny\n5(1+Ry)lNy\n,\nζy,t =\n(5+Ry)∆¯θTO\ny\n20(1+Ry) +\nθA\ny,t\n4 . Notably, the value of δ that is\nalways less than 1 (for ∆t equal to 1 h, 30 min or 15 min, δ\nwill be 0.75, 0.857 or 0.923, respectively) plays an important\nrole in the transformer degradation cost intertemporal impact.\nOne issue naturally arising in the context of the enhanced\noperational planning problem that internalizes intertemporal\ntransformer cost relations is the impact of decisions at period t\nextending beyond the optimization horizon. First, rolling hori-\nzon approaches are typical potential remedies, which would\nalso provide an additional means for dealing with day-ahead\nto real-time uncertainty associated with day-ahead forecasted\nand actual real-time DER preferences. Second, an extended\nhorizon for the transformer degradation cost might offer a\nreasonable alternative solution; it should include the next half\nday to capture 4 oil time constants, while accounting for\nanticipated ambient temperature trend. A third approach, quite\nsuitable for simulations, is to set the following constraint:\nhy,T = hy,0 →(ρy), ∀y, (27)\nwhich essentially models the daily 24-hour ahead problem as\na cycle repeating over identical days. This constraint’s dual\nvariable, ρy, captures the future impact on transformer LoL\nof loading towards the end of the day. Alternatively, we could\nrequire some explicit condition for hy,T, e.g., equal or less\nthan or equal to some target for the next day initial condition,\nand add a cost in the objective function (pre-calculated by\nofﬂine studies) for deviating from this target.\nC. Optimization Problem (Enhanced AC OPF) Summary\nThe objective function of the enhanced AC OPF problem\n— referred to as Full-opt— aims at minimizing the aggregate\nreal and reactive power cost, and the transformer degradation\ncost. The real power cost, cP\nt , is typically the LMP at the\nT&D interface, cQ\nt can be viewed as the opportunity cost for\nthe provision of reactive power, and cy is the hourly cost for\ntransformer y. Full-opt is deﬁned as follows:\nminimize\nReal Power Cost\n  ∑\nt\ncP\nt P0,t +\nReactive Power Cost\n  ∑\nt\ncQ\nt Q0,t +\nTransformer Cost\n  ∑\ny,t\ncyfy,t , (28)\nsubject to: network constraints (1)–(7), transformer constraints\n(25)–(27), DER constraints (10)–(16), with variables vi,t, lij,t,\nfy,t, ps,t, pe,t, ue,t nonnegative, and P0,t, Q0,t, Pij,t, Qij,t,\npj,t, qj,t, hy,t, qs,t, qe,t unrestricted in sign.\nIt is important to note that the quadratic equality constraint\n(5) is non-convex. Following [20], we relax (5) to vi,tlij,t ≥\nP2\nij,t+Q2\nij,t, ∀j,t, and the resulting relaxed AC OPF problem\n5\nis a convex SOCP problem, which can be solved efﬁciently\nusing commercially available solvers.\nIII. DLMC C OMPONENTS\nIn this section, we provide a rigorous analysis and interpre-\ntation of DLMCs, which represent the dynamic marginal cost\nfor delivering real and reactive power, denoted by P-DLMC\nand Q-DLMC, respectively, at a speciﬁc location and time\nperiod. In the context of the Full-opt problem, DLMCs are\nobtained by the dual variables of constraints (2) and (3) — at\nthe root node, we have λP\n0,t = cP\nt , and λQ\n0,t = cQ\nt .\nNotably, DLMCs can be deﬁned for any DER schedule\nreﬂected in net demand variables pj,t and qj,t. Given these\nvariables, the AC OPF problem solution deﬁnes an operating\npoint for the distribution network, which is obtained by the\nsolution of the power ﬂow equations (2)–(5) for a given root\nnode voltage, and is described by the real/reactive power ﬂows,\nvoltages and currents, i.e., variables Pij,t, Qij,t, vj,t, and lij,t.\nDLMC decomposition employs sensitivity analysis, duality\nand optimality conditions of the enhanced AC OPF problem.\nLet us consider DLMCs at node j′, time period t′, λP\nj′,t′\nand λQ\nj′,t′ . The sensitivity of the power ﬂow solution w.r.t.\nnet demand for real and reactive power, is reﬂected in partial\nderivatives\n∂Pij,t′\n∂pj′,t′ ,\n∂Qij,t′\n∂pj′,t′ ,\n∂vj,t′\n∂pj′,t′ ,\n∂lij,t′\n∂pj′,t′ , and\n∂Pij,t′\n∂qj′,t′ ,\n∂Qij,t′\n∂qj′,t′ ,\n∂vj,t′\n∂qj′,t′ ,\n∂lij,t′\n∂qj′,t′ , respectively. The calculation of sensitivities\nw.r.t.real net demand at node j′, time period t′(4N unknowns)\ninvolves the solution of a linear system derived from power\nﬂow equations (2)-(5), after taking partial derivatives w.r.t.\npj′,t′ , at time period t′, for all nodes (4N equations). Similarly\nfor the sensitivities w.r.t. reactive net demand. In total, it\nrequires the (amenable to parallelization) solution of 2NT\nlinear systems (referring to sensitivities w.r.t. real and reactive\npower net demand, calculated at N nodes, for T time periods),\neach system involving 4N equations and 4N unknowns.\nThe DLMC decomposition to additive components follows:\nλP\nj′,t′ = cP\nt′ +\nReal Power Marginal Losses\n  \ncP\nt′\n∑\nj\nrij\n∂lij,t′\n∂pj′,t′\n+\nReactive Power Marginal Losses\n  \ncQ\nt′\n∑\nj\nxij\n∂lij,t′\n∂pj′,t′\n+\nV oltage Congestion\n  ∑\nj\nµj,t′\n∂vj,t′\n∂pj′,t′\n+\nAmpacity Congestion\n  ∑\nj\nνj,t′\n∂lij,t′\n∂pj′,t′\n+\nTransformer Degradation\n  ∑\ny\nπy,t′\n∂ly,t′\n∂pj′,t′\n,\nλQ\nj′,t′ = cQ\nt′ +\nReal Power Marginal Losses\n  \ncP\nt′\n∑\nj\nrij\n∂lij,t′\n∂qj′,t′\n+\nReactive Power Marginal Losses\n  \ncQ\nt′\n∑\nj\nxij\n∂lij,t′\n∂qj′,t′\n+\nV oltage Congestion\n  ∑\nj\nµj,t′\n∂vj,t′\n∂qj′,t′\n+\nAmpacity Congestion\n  ∑\nj\nνj,t′\n∂lij,t′\n∂qj′,t′\n+\nTransformer Degradation\n  ∑\ny\nπy,t′\n∂ly,t′\n∂qj′,t′\n,\nwhere parameter πy,t′ includes the intertemporal impact of the\ntransformer degradation component. For both expressions, the\nﬁrst three terms are obtained by associating equations (2) and\n(3) recursively to (1), and taking the partial derivatives. The\nﬁrst component is the marginal cost of real/reactive power at\nthe root node. The second and the third components represent\nthe contribution of real and reactive power marginal losses\nthat are sensitive to changes in net real and reactive power\ndemand. The fourth component reﬂects voltage congestion,\nwith µj,t′ = ¯µj,t′ −µj,t′ . It is nonzero only at nodes with a\nbinding voltage constraint, i.e., when ¯µj,t′ > 0 or µj,t′ > 0.\nThe ﬁfth component represents ampacity congestion. It is non\nzero only at lines with a binding ampacity constraint, i.e.,\nwhen νj,t′ >0. V oltage and ampacity congestion components\nare derived by appending the active (binding) constraints in\nthe Full-opt Lagrangian; alternatively, they can be obtained by\nthe optimality conditions. Last, and perhaps most important,\nthe sixth component represents the impact on transformer\ndegradation costs that are intertemporally coupled with real\nand reactive power injections during preceding time periods.\nWe next derive the formula for πy,t′ and elaborate on it.\nConsider, without loss of generality, the P-DLMC com-\nponent. Applying (26) recursively, we get hy,t = δthy,0 +∑t\nτ=1 δt−τ (ϵyly,τ + ζy,τ), ∀y,t. Taking the partial derivatives\nof hy,t w.r.t. pj′,t′ , we get: ∂hy,t\n∂pj′,t′ = ϵyδt−t′ ∂ly,t′\n∂pj′,t′ , ∀y,t ≥t′.\nFrom the binding transformer constraints (25), using optimal-\nity conditions and ∂hy,t\n∂pj′,t′ , the impact within the optimization\nhorizon is given by:\n∑\ny,t\ncy\n∂fy,t\n∂pj′,t′\n=\n∑\ny,t,κ\nξy,t,κ\n(\nακ\n∂hy,t\n∂pj′,t′\n+ βy,κ\n∂ly,t\n∂pj′,t′\n)\n=\n(\nϵy\nT∑\nt=t′\nδt−t′\n˜ξy,t +\n∑\nκ\nξy,t′,κβy,κ\n) ∂ly,t\n∂pj′,t′\n,\nwhere ˜ξy,t = ∑\nκξy,t,κaκ. We note that ∑\nκξy,t,κ = cy, and,\nobviously, the sum ∑\nκξy,t,κ involves only the binding con-\nstraints (otherwise ξy,t,κ = 0); if only one constraint is active,\nthen the respective dual ξy,t,κ should equal cy. Adding the\nimpact that extends beyond the optimization horizon, which\nis obtained by appending (27) in the Lagrangian yielding\nρy\n∂hy,T\n∂pj′,t′ = ϵyδT−t′\nρy\n∂ly,t′\n∂pj′,t′ , πy,t′ is given by:\nπy,t′ = ϵy\n( T∑\nt=t′\nδt−t′\n˜ξy,t + δT−t′\nρy\n)\n+ ηy˜ξy,t′ , (29)\nwhere ηy =\n4∆¯θH\ny\n5lNy\n(hence, βy,κ = ηyακ, and ∑\nκξy,t′,κβy,κ =\nηy˜ξy,t′ ). Notably, πy,t′ involves a summation over time that\nis related to the transformer thermal response dynamics and\ncaptures subsequent time period costs. The ﬁrst term in (29)\nthat is multiplied by ϵy refers to the contribution of the load\nat time period t′ to the TO temperature at t′ and subsequent\ntime periods as well as the impact that extends beyond the\noptimization horizon (involving dual variable ρy), whereas the\nsecond term that is multiplied by ηy refers to the contribution\nto the winding temperature rise over the TO. Recall that the\nwinding time constant is small compared to our time period\nlength (1 hour), hence its impact is limited to time period t′,\nwhereas the oil time constant is larger, hence the intertemporal\nimpact on subsequent time periods is not negligible. This\nintertemporal impact is discounted by δt−t′\n(with δ <1), but\nit also considers the slope of transformer LoL aκ and applies\na higher weight to high HST time periods — recall that this\nslope is large when the HST is high reﬂecting current and past\n6\nperiod transformer loading. The impact that extends beyond\nthe optimization horizon is discounted by δT−t′\n, hence, it may\nbecome signiﬁcant for hours closer to the end of the horizon.\nLastly, we note that the decomposition of DLMCs to\nadditive components enables the rigorous quantiﬁcation of\ncosts by source and more importantly the use of distributed\nalgorithms to allow the scaling of AC OPF to real distribution\nfeeders. The contribution of each component can primarily\nprovide useful information for pricing purposes, the potential\nallocation of associated revenue and for network asset and\nDER capacity expansion when the marginal costs obtained at\nthe optimal DER schedule are sufﬁciently high. In addition,\nhowever, the fact that we can obtain marginal-cost-component-\nspeciﬁc sensitivities for a given system operating point allow\nus, in the absence of active congestion constraints, to estimate\nthe marginal costs without solving the AC OPF, but using\ninstead a power ﬂow solver. We note that the transformer\nmarginal cost component can be estimated by calculating the\ntemperature trajectory and using the aging model.\nIV. C ASE STUDY BASED NUMERICAL FINDINGS\nIn this section, we present the case study input data and\nscheduling options (Subsection IV-A), we discuss the main\nﬁndings (Subsection IV-B), and we elaborate on the trans-\nformer degradation intertemporal impact (Subsection IV-C).\nA. Case Study Input Data and Scheduling Options\nOur proposed model is illustrated on a 13.8-kV , 307-node,\n110-transformer, feeder of Holyoke Gas and Electric (HGE),\na municipal distribution utility in MA, US. To improve the\nexposition of results while emphasizing the local effect of\nDERs, we consider different levels of EVs and PVs connected\nexclusively to two nodes, depicted in Fig. 1, representing\ntwo 30-kV A transformers serving commercial and residen-\ntial loads. For both transformers, R = 5 , ∆¯θTO = 55 ,\n∆¯θH = 25 , and M = 8 ( ˜FAA linearization follows [27,\nFig. 1]; indicatively, with 3 equal segments from 110oC to\n140oC the maximum error is less than 1 hour, whereas 6\nequal segments would reduce the maximum error by a factor\nof 3 overestimating LoL by at most 3%. At the commercial\n(residential) node, EVs are connected 9am–5pm (7pm–7am)\nand require charging 12 kWh (18 kWh). At departure, EVs\nmust be fully charged. EV battery capacity is 50 kWh, the\nmaximum charging rate 3.3 kW/h, and the charger capacity\n6.6 kV A. PVs are 10-kV A rooftop solar units. To model\ninitial conditions in the daily cycle reasonably, transformer\nResidential load\n30-kVA transformer\nCommercial load\n30-kVA transformer\nRoot\nnode\nFig. 1. Feeder topology diagram. Transformers: round (pole); square (pad);\ngreen (residential); red (commercial); sizes reﬂect nameplate capacity. Feeder\ndata (lines, transformers, load proﬁles, irradation level, ambient temperature)\nare listed in [28, Section III.A].\ntemperatures were required to coincide at the beginning and\nat the end of the cycle; a similar constraint was imposed on\nEV battery SoC.\nWe consider the following 4 EV/PV scheduling options:\n•“BaU” (Business as Usual): EVs “dumb” charge at full rate\nupon arrival with p.f. = 1. PVs operate with p.f. = 1.\n•“ToU” (Time-of-Use): EVs charge to minimize real power\ncost relative to the selected LMP trajectory while maintaining\np.f. = 1. PVs operate with p.f. = 1.\n• “PQ-opt”: EVs/PVs are scheduled in order to minimize\nreal and reactive power cost, subject to voltage and ampacity\nconstraints while ignoring transformer degradation cost. PQ-\nopt can be thought of as a traditional line loss minimization\nproblem akin to the day-ahead problem presented in [25]. It\ncan be alternatively thought of as a special case of Full-opt\nbelow without considering transformer degradation costs.\n• “Full-opt”: EVs/PVs are scheduled by adapting to full\nDLMCs including transformer degradation costs, given by\nthe solution of Full-opt summarized in (28).\nB. Numerical Results\nOptimization problems were solved on a Dell Intel Core\ni7-5500U @2.4 GHz with 8 GB RAM, using CPLEX 12.7,\nsolution times were up to 10 sec, and convex relaxations were\nexact in all instances.\nIn Table I, we compare several DER penetration scenarios\nat the nodes of interest: EVs equal 0, 3, and 6, and rooftop PV\ninstallations equal 0, 30, and 60-kV A (i.e., 0, 3, and 6 units\nof 10-kV A rooftop solar, respectively). The scenario with 0\nEVs and PVs serves as the base case for reference purposes.\nTable I shows the system-wide daily cost differences (in $) for\nreal/reactive power (P/Q), transformer degradation, and total\ncost relative to the base case. For readability, negative values\nare shown in red. Table I reports also the aggregate daily Loss\nof Life (LoL) of the two 30-kV A transformers. As expected,\nFull-opt achieves the lowest total cost, since it co-optimizes\nreal/reactive power and transformer cost and maintains low\nLoL. PQ-opt achieves the lowest combined real and reactive\npower costs (P and Q columns in Table I), but exhibits some\nvery high values of aggregate LoL and transformer degradation\ncost, as a result of high reactive power provision. Unlike PQ-\nopt and Full-opt, ToU and BaU do not take advantage of\nDER reactive power provision capabilities, but in some cases,\nparticularly in the residential node, achieve low aggregate LoL.\nIn the commercial node, BaU and ToU produce identical\nEV schedules (by coincidence LMPs are increasing during the\nday). In the residential node, ToU exhibits a 3-hour shift rela-\ntive to the BaU EV proﬁle (EVs start charging at 10pm). For\nthe speciﬁc LMPs and EV/PV penetrations, the ToU schedule\nresults in sustainable transformer LoL performance; different\nLMPs though and/or higher penetration levels may result in\nworse performance of the ToU option. Since we focus on\nunderstanding the granularity of DLMCs, we did not consider\nmultiple EV proﬁles and arrival times that would demonstrate\nthe potential synchronization under the ToU schedule (see\ne.g., the simulations in [3]) resulting in worse performance\n7\nTABLE I\nAGGREGATE SYSTEM COST DIFFERENCE (IN $) AND LOL (IN HOURS )\nP Q Tr.

DLMCs, commercial and residential nodes, 3 EVs.\nrelative to the BaU schedule. For the high EV/PV penetration\npresented later, however, high LoL is associated with ToU.\nIt is important to note that with the exception of Full-opt\ngenerated schedules, all other DER schedules are not adapted\nto DLMCs. Under BaU, ToU, and PQ-opt, DLMCs simply\nrepresent the marginal cost of delivering an incremental unit\nof real and reactive power to/at a speciﬁc network location\nand time, conditional upon the given DER (EV/PV) schedules.\nAs such, DLMCs under non-adaptive schedules should be\ninterpreted as ex post spatiotemporal marginal costs indicating\ndesirable directions of change. So for a given DER schedule\n(BU, ToU, PQ-opt), DLMCs are calculated solving a partial\nFull-opt problem with given/ﬁxed EV/PV schedules. As such,\nDLMCs can be interpreted as economically/socially efﬁcient\nﬁnancial incentives indicating a direction for improving system\ncosts. For example, a DLMC at a speciﬁc node and time, which\nis higher than the Full-opt DLMC, signals that less power\nshould be consumed then and there, if at all possible.\nLet us ﬁrst consider the EV-only penetration scenarios. In\nFig. 2, we show P-DLMCs and Q-DLMCs for a relatively\nlow 3-EV scenario. The differences are rather small and are\nrelated to difference in the provision of reactive power. At the\ncommercial node, P-DLMCs are practically the same under\nall scheduling options. Q-DLMCs are higher under BaU/ToU\ncompared to PQ-opt/Full-opt, indicating that higher reactive\npower provision would be desirable. At the residential node,\nP-DLMCs associated with BaU EV schedules are higher\n0\n20\n40\n60\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\nTr\nQ\nP\nQoppCost\n-100\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\nTr\nQ\nP\nLMP\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\nP-DLMC ($/MWh)\nHour\nP-DLMC ($/MWh)\nP-DLMC ($/MWh)\nHour\nHour\nQ-DLMC ($/MVARh)\nHour\nHour\nHour\nQ-DLMC ($/MVARh)\nQ-DLMC ($/MVARh)\nBaU/ToU BaU/ToU\nPQ-opt\nPQ-opt\nFull-opt Full-opt\nFig. 3.

Q-\nDLMCs associated with BaU/ToU EV schedules suggest the\ndesirability of providing reactive power; this coincides with\nthe results of Full-opt and PQ-opt that indeed provide reactive\npower and decrease system-wide cost. P-DLMC components\nrange from 1.7% to 7.5% for real power losses, from 0.2%\nto 0.9% for reactive power losses and from 0.2% to 1.7% for\ntransformer degradation. For Q-DLMCs, during hours 10–17\n(when EVs are plugged in), the marginal cost components for\nreal and reactive power are lower under Full-opt, while the\ntransformer degradation component becomes negative. This\nis interestingly associated with a reverse reactive power ﬂow\nat that node and those time periods rendering the sensitivity\nof the current w.r.t. reactive power net demand negative. Q-\nDLMC components under Full-opt range from 8% to 30.7%\nfor real power losses, from 1% to 3.7% for reactive power\nlosses, and from -2% to 5% for transformer degradation.\nThe 6-EV penetration scenario is more impactful, and PQ-\nopt is associated with a 5 to 9 fold higher aggregate trans-\nformer LoL relative to Full-opt (see Table I).

Full-opt Q-DLMCs\nsupport the system-optimal solution by incentivizing EVs to\nprovide reactive power at a rate that is lower than their charger\ncapability, whereas PQ-opt “brute-forces” EVs to fully utilize\ntheir inverter capability resulting in negative Q-DLMCs that\nsigniﬁcantly increase the imputed cost of EVs.\nIt is noteworthy that the marginal transformer degradation\ncost varies across scenarios and scheduling options illustrating\nthe DLMC-implied incentives. Indeed, the DLMC spikes (pos-\nitive/negative) are caused by the transformer degradation com-\nponent. In general, low transformer costs incurred by Full-opt\nacross all hours are associated with smoother DLMC proﬁles.\nNotably, although voltage and ampacity DLMC components\nare zero, i.e., the respective constraints are not binding, trans-\nformer degradation is high. This is an interesting observation\nshowing that traditional line loss minimization approaches\nemploying V olt/V AR control capabilities of smart inverters\nand capacitors, such as in PQ-opt, may “mask” the signiﬁcant\nimpact of transformer degradation on DLMCs, and impose\npotentially excessive cost on the distribution network assets.\nSimilar remarks can be made for the residential node.\nConsidering the PV-only penetration scenarios, Table I\nsuggests that the 30-kV A PV scenario has rather insigniﬁcant\nimpact on network costs, whereas the 60-kV A scenario is\nquite impactful, with PQ-opt yielding very high aggregate LoL\nvalues compared to BaU or Full-opt. For the latter scenario,\nat the residential node, we illustrate, in Fig. 4, P-DLMCs and\nQ-DLMCs under BaU and Full-opt (top ﬁgure), P-DLMC\ntransformer degradation components for BaU and Full-opt\n(bottom left), and P-DLMC components for PQ-opt (bottom\nright). We observe that BaU and Full-opt result in similar\nP-DLMCs (top left); the differences are explained by the\ntransformer degradation component (bottom left). For BaU\nand Full-opt, the transformer component becomes negative\nduring hours 9–17, when there is a reverse real power ﬂow\n(PV generation exceeds the load) and the sensitivity of the\ncurrent w.r.t. net demand becomes negative. The transformer\ncomponent under PQ-opt (bottom right) is “ampliﬁed” — at\nleast two orders of magnitude higher than Full-opt. We also\nobserve a negative voltage component under PQ-opt at hours\n6 and 7, when the voltage upper bound is reached, indicating\na negative sensitivity of the voltage w.r.t. net demand. Indeed,\nincreasing net demand would result in a voltage drop. How-\never, the transformer degradation component at those hours is\npositive, indicating a positive sensitivity of the current w.r.t.\nnet demand, and is about 4 to 5 times larger in magnitude than\nthe voltage component. Similar to the 6-EV scenario, DLMC\ndifferences are caused by reactive power provision. Positive\nQ-DLMCs under BaU (top right) encourage the provision\nof reactive power. Under PQ-opt, Q-DLMCs (not shown\nin Fig. 4) become highly negative, suggesting that reactive\npower provision is excessive (PVs fully utilize their inverter\ncapabilities). Under Full-opt, PVs provide reactive power as\nneeded to minimize system cost; Q-DLMCs tank, indicating\nthat there is excess installed capacity and it is optimal to\nunderutilize it. Full utilization, as is the case under PQ-opt,\nrenders negative Q-DLMCs and interacts with P-DLMCs to\nresult in a large transformer degradation component.\nConsidering the EV-PV synergy, with the exception of PQ-\nopt at the residential node, the 3-EV and 30-kV A PV scenarios\nare easily sustainable with low aggregate LoL. At hours 6, 7,\n20, and 21, high reverse reactive power ﬂows overload the\ntransformer. P-DLMCs exhibit positive spikes and Q-DLMCs\nnegative spikes at those hours. Increasing EVs to 6 and/or\nPVs to 60-kV A results in very high LoL under PQ-opt. On\nthe other hand, as expected, Full-opt achieves sustainability\nwith low LoL under all scenarios.\nLastly, we consider increased DER penetrations. Full-opt\nis still able to accommodate 9 and 12 EVs, whereas other\nscheduling options fail. ToU keeps reasonably low aggregate\nLoL (40 hours) only for the 9-EV scenario at the residential\nnode, although still 2-fold higher than Full-opt, whereas 32-\nfold higher LoL values are observed for the 12-EV scenario. At\nthe commercial node, BaU/ToU exhibit aggregate LoL values\nthat exceed 1000 hours (PQ-opt is even worse). The robust\nperformance of Full-opt with increasing EV penetrations is\nexplained by an appropriate reduction in the charging rate\nand the utilization of the inverter. Notably, for the 12-EV\nscenario, Full-opt reaches 114 aggregate LoL hours, which\nis still 40 times lower than the values encountered under\nBaU/ToU schedules. Experimentation with 90 and 120-kV A\nPV penetration scenarios showed that Full-opt can signiﬁcantly\nincrease PV hosting capacity “curtailing” real and reactive\npower as needed, and, thus, avoiding excessive transformer\ntemperatures and LoL. Notably, if we consider self-scheduling\nPVs responding to optimal DLMC-based signals, Full-opt\nDLMCs support economically efﬁcient “curtailment.”\n9\n0\n50\n100\n150\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\nWinding (hour t')\nTop-Oil (hour t')\nTop-Oil (hours >t')\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\nBaU/ToU PQ-opt\n$/MWh\n$/MWh\n$/MWh\nHourHour\nHour\nFull-opt\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23\nBaU/ToU\nPQ-opt\nFull-opt\nHour\nLoad Ratio\nTransformer Degradation Component Transformer Degradation Component\nTransformer Degradation Component\nFig. 5.

Transformer Degradation Intertemporal Impact\nIn general, the transformer degradation component at a spe-\nciﬁc location includes the impact on all transformers through\nweights that are proportional to the sensitivities of the current\nw.r.t. net demand. Since in our feeder, overloads are located\non two rather distant transformers, we focus our attention on\nthe impact only on the transformer located at a speciﬁc node.\nWe also note that a numerical evaluation of the thermal model\napproximations in the HST calculations yielded very accurate\nresults with average errors of about 1%-2% or lower in the\nhigh loading conditions of interest to our analysis.\nLet us consider transformer y denoted by line ij′. Its\nP-DLMC degradation component at node j′, time period\nt′, πy,t′\n∂ly,t′\n∂pj′,t′ , is given by\n[(∂ly,t′\n∂pj′,t′\n)\n/lN\ny\n]{\nρy\n[55\n6\n(3\n4\n)T−t′ ]\n+\ncy\n[55\n6 ˜αy,t′ + 20˜αy,t′ + ∑T−t′\nτ=1\n(3\n4\n)τ\n˜αy,t′+τ\n]}\n, where ρy cap-\ntures the impact of increasing HST in hour 24 on future HST\nand transformer degradation, ˜αy,t = 1\ncy\n˜ξy,t = 1\ncy\n∑\nκξy,t,κaκ\nis an adjusted slope of the aging acceleration factor. First,\nwe note that the component depends on the sensitivity of the\ncurrent w.r.t. net demand at hour t′, which determines the\nsign of the component, normalized by the transformer nominal\ncurrent. Second, the component depends on the slope of the\naging acceleration factor at hour t′, as well as the respective\nslopes of subsequent hours. The impact that is related to hour\nt′ includes the contribution of the TO temperature and the\nwinding. In fact, there is a ﬁxed ratio between the two that\ndepends on the transformer parameters, which in our case\nis equal to 2.18 (the contribution of the winding is higher).\nThe impact that is related to subsequent periods refers only\nto the TO temperature dynamics. Interestingly, although this\nimpact decays with\n(3\n4\n)τ\n, for each hour τ that follows t′, it can\nbecome signiﬁcant when the slopes ˜αy,t′+τ are quite large. As\nwe show next, the impact that extends beyond the optimization\nhorizon that is related to ρy may also become signiﬁcant.\nLet us consider the P-DLMCs for the 6-EV penetration\nscenario, at the commercial node, shown in Fig. 3 (left). For\nthis scenario, we show in Fig. 5 the load ratio and the trans-\nformer degradation sub-components. An interesting remark is\nthat the transformer component becomes signiﬁcant before\nthe EVs plug in, e.g., at hour 9, due to the TO temperature\nimpact on subsequent hours. Under BaU/ToU schedules, the\ntransformer component becomes 10.96 ($/MWh) at hour 9,\naccounting for 23.3% of the P-DLMC. The component is still\nsigniﬁcant even at hours 7 and 8, accounting for 9.95% and\n15.3% of the P-DLMC, respectively. It becomes as high as\n153.75 ($/MWh) at hour 9, and diminishes after hour 14 as the\ntransformer cools down. At hours that precede the overloading\nhours (due to EVs) and at the ﬁrst two hours of charging,\nthe impact on the subsequent hours dominates the transformer\ncomponent. The winding and TO impact become dominant at\nhour 12. PQ-opt exhibits similar results which are ampliﬁed\nand extended (in time duration) by the excessive brute-force-\ndriven reactive power provision. The transformer component\nbecomes signiﬁcant starting at hour 6 (9.3% of the P-DLMC),\nit reaches a maximum of 178.1 ($/MWh) at hour 12, the\nimpact of subsequent hours remains large until hour 11, and\nthen diminishes after hour 18. Similar intertemporal effects are\nobserved under the Full-opt, although the behavior is much\nsmoother compared to PQ-opt. The impact on subsequent\nhours makes up the major part of the P-DLMC until hour 10,\nand even though the transformer component becomes higher\nrelative to BaU/ToU at hours 14–18 (ranging from 3 to 8\n$/MWh), the proﬁle is smoother.\nV. C ONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH\nWe have provided an enhanced AC OPF for granular\nmarginal costing on distribution networks including asset\ndegradation costs exempliﬁed by transformer marginal LoL.\nWe have also derived and analyzed additive DLMC compo-\nnents, and illustrated the intertemporal characteristics of the\ntransformer degradation component. The DLMCs estimated\nby the proposed AC OPF are compatible with optimal DER\nself-scheduling that is fully adapted to the optimal distribution\nnetwork conﬁguration. As such, the DLMCs represent the\nspatiotemporal marginal costs on the distribution network that\nco-optimize network and DER scheduling decisions. Whereas\nwe have considered the real and reactive power marginal cost\nat the substation bus to be given, it is possible that after all dis-\ntribution networks and their DER schedules are co-optimized,\nthe Wholesale Transmission market adjusts producing new\nLMPs. Although LMPs are most likely to be insensitive to\nreal power DLMCs that affect primarily distribution node\ninjections but less so the aggregate T&D power exchange,\nit is possible that reactive power compensation at the T&D\ninterface is impacted by the distribution network reactive\npower schedule. This is a topic of future work that may require\nISOs to provide reasonable, possibly extended LMP type, price\nfunctions at the T&D interface.\nOur numerical results inquiry has focused on service trans-\nformers that are sensitive to granular/location-speciﬁc DER\nschedules. A study focusing on the T&D interface particularly\nduring the few weeks following a station transformer failure,\ncould and should model station transformers placing them\non the line connecting the root node to the immediately\ndownstream node. During periods of station transformer over-\nloading, the root node LMP would be translated to a higher\ndownstream DLMC.\nEmploying an actual distribution feeder, we have shown that\noptimal DLMC-driven DER scheduling can achieve signiﬁ-\n10\ncantly higher hosting of DERs by distribution networks with\nminimal infrastructure investments. In a practical application\nthat one may expect to be adopted in the future, DERs that\nopt in a DLMC-based rate would most likely see a two-part\ntariff, consisting of a DLMC part and a constant part aimed\nto address ﬁxed cost recovery issues. We anticipate that so-\nphisticated rate designs that ﬁne tune two-part tariff ideas will\nattract the attention of capable system engineers, economists\nand practitioners. Most importantly, we have shown that when\nDER schedules “adapt” to feeder DLMCs, the equilibrium\nDLMC proﬁles are rather smooth, thus allaying fears that\nDLMC volatility may lead to ratepayer revolt if DLMC-\nbased rates are adopted. Comparison with popular open-loop\nDER scheduling options provided solid evidence that optimal\nDLMC-based clearing markets can bring about signiﬁcant\neconomic efﬁciencies and support the sustainability/adequacy\nof current distribution network infrastructure in the presence\nof high DER (PV , EV , and the like) adoption. It is also\nparticularly notable that the presence of DERs scheduled\noptimally through spatiotemporal DLMC adaptation will have\na signiﬁcant impact on grid asset capacity expansion choices.\nIn this work, the optimal daily/24-hour operational planning\ntask employed a centralized decision maker who is aware of\nboth network information and DER capabilities, preferences\nand constraints. Alternatively, decentralized, distributed algo-\nrithms [29] can be employed, in which DERs respond to hour\nand location speciﬁc DLMCs communicated to them by the\nnetwork operator to derive tentative schedules and interact\niteratively until the optimal daily operational schedules are\nobtained. In addition, we note that a distributed algorithm\napproach to operational scheduling would be preferable since\nit would enable individual DERs to respond to day-ahead\nDLMCs by optimizing the sum of operational scheduling\nbeneﬁts plus likely real-time preference variations, however\nlarge or small but likely to vary across individual DERs, as\nrepresented by the uncertain real-time DLMCs.\nFurthermore, we should acknowledge that the role of uncer-\ntainty will become signiﬁcant as more stochastic resources are\ncoming into play. The well-known remedy has been to secure\nreserves; in fact [16] is the ﬁrst DLMP work that discusses\nreserves in distribution networks. Notably, deﬁning the reserve\nrequirements is another open research area. We envision that in\nthe future, reserves will be quite likely deﬁned endogenously\nreplacing rules-of-thumb and ofﬂine studies that determine\nmostly static and generally overly conservative security mar-\ngins in current utility practice. In [30], a chance-constrained\nAC OPF formulation is employed to introduce uncertainty\nin radial distribution networks, considering only small-scale\ngenerators as controllable DERs, and treating all behind-the-\nmeter DERs as uncontrollable. However, we envision that\nthe latter DERs have a great potential to be controlled and\nscheduled, thus playing a key role in dealing with uncertainty\nin distribution networks, and we believe that this is a research\ndirection that is certainly worth pursuing.\nLastly, our ongoing research includes extending our DLMC\nframework to a 3-phase network representation, considering\nunbalanced distribution grids, addressing degradation of other\nnetwork assets, e.g., distribution lines, and employing de-\ncomposition approaches and distributed algorithms [31] that\nrely on our unbundling of DLMCs to additive components\nso that we can deal with real size multiple feeder systems\nand large numbers of diverse DERs transcending EVs and\nPVs and including micro generators, smart buildings with pre-\ncooling/heating capable HV AC, smart appliances, storage, and\nnew technologies.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Holyoke Gas and Electric\nfor providing actual feeder data for the pilot study.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F.
