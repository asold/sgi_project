  "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;This paper delves into the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as they pertain to national security, with a particular emphasis on their integration into military applications. Through an in-depth analysis of the United States' progress in assimilating AI technologies into the battle space, the paper seeks to reinvigorate enthusiasm about the potential of AI in safeguarding national interests. Key aspects of this paper include the necessity of protecting AI systems from adversaries, as well as the inherent challenges and risks that come with integrating them into military operations. The paper concludes by underscoring the strategic significance of AI in the realm of national security and outlines a set of strategic imperatives for military leaders and policymakers to ensure success in this critical domain.&lt;/p&gt;",
