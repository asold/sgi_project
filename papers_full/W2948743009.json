The purpose \nof this review was to identify what patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been employed with people who use \nAAC. Of the tools identified, the review aimed to establish what conceptual frameworks were used and how the reports \ndescribe completion of the PROM.\nMethods A systematic literature review was carried out. A pre-defined set of search terms was entered into five main health \nand education databases. Titles and abstracts were sifted for relevance. Full text papers were screened against inclusion/\nexclusion criteria. Data pertaining to the type and nature of the PROM used was extracted. Complementary data sources \nwere analysed to construct a narrative synthesis of the papers identified.\nResults Within 15 papers that met the review criteria, 25 PROMs were used with people who rely on AAC comprising of 15 \nseparate measures. The conceptual frameworks for 12 of these tools were reported from which 62 items, or concepts being \nmeasured, were identified. Following synthesis of these items, 9 conceptual domains and 11 sub-domains were generated. \nLimited information was available about who completed the PROM nor how much, if any, support they received.\nConclusions No PROM that has been developed specifically for people who use AAC was identified by this review. Of the \ntools that have been used with people who use AAC, the concepts measured were broad and varied. The quality of reporting \nconcerning who completed the PROM was limited, undermining the trustworthiness of many of the studies.\nKeywords Augmentative and alternative communication · AAC  · Communication aids · Patient-reported outcome \nmeasures · PROMs · Systematic review\nIntroduction\nAugmentative and alternative communication (AAC) refers \nto strategies used to support people who have complex com-\nmunication needs characterised by difficulties with speech \nand/or language production in spoken or written modes [1]. \nThey range from simple, paper-based systems consisting of \nsingle pages or books of words, phrases or pictures (known \nas ‘low-tech AAC’) to more complex electronic or com-\nputer-based systems (known as ‘high-tech AAC’). High-tech \nAAC can be used to produce synthesised speech of messages \nstored within them or entered into them by the person who \nuses AAC or their family, carer or AAC professional [1].\nThe population who use AAC is diverse and consists of \npeople with multiple and complex physical and cognitive \ndifficulties [2]. People who use AAC may have communica-\ntion difficulties from birth associated with conditions such \nas cerebral palsy or acquire difficulties as an adult follow -\ning a stroke, head injury or from a degenerative condition \nsuch as Parkinson’s [1]. Approximately one in 150 people in \n * Katherine Broomfield \n Katherine.broomfield@nhs.net\n1 Gloucestershire Care Services NHS Trust, Gloucester, UK\n2 Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK\n3 Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Barnsley, UK\n4 Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK\n5 Bristol Speech and Language Therapy Research Unit, \nPines and Steps, Southmead Hospital, Westbury on Trym, \nBristol BS10 5NB, UK\n2670 Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683\n1 3\nEngland (0.5% of the population) could benefit from using \nAAC [3].\nChildren and young people use AAC to support them to \naccess education and enable them to build peer relationships \n[4]. Adults and older people use AAC to maintain relation-\nships, occupation and to avoid social isolation [5]. However, \nAAC is a type of assistive technology (AT) and obsolescence \nand non-use of AT has been identified as a concern for a \nlong time [6]. There is evidence to suggest that AAC is also \nat risk of being under-utilised or abandoned if, for example, \npeople have limited access to support or training, devices \nare not maintained, or if there is poor fit between the AAC \ndevice and the individual using it [7]. Some researchers have \nidentified a connection between the level of engagement of \nthe AT end-user and the overall use of AT solutions [8 , 9]. \nUnderstanding that an individual’s needs and priorities are at \nthe heart of clinical assessment, can foster improved engage-\nment in healthcare [10 ] and can lead to improved health \noutcomes [11].\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) refer to \ntools that have been designed to provide information on the \nstatus of a patient’s health condition [12]. A PROM should \nmeasure a specific concept (or set of concepts), known as \na conceptual framework, which has been developed with \nrelevance to an intended population [12]. The use of PROMs \nis not considered credible unless there is evidence that it \nhas been validated with the population of interest [12]. The \npurpose of PROMs is to get patients’ own assessment of \ntheir health or their health-related quality of life (typically \nconcepts relating to emotional health and physical function-\ning) and therefore patients usually complete these directly \n[13]. PROMs are usually in the form of questionnaires and \nare typically used as evaluation tools. They can also be of \nvalue as part of the clinical interview and assessment [14]. \nFor example, the information can be used by clinicians as a \nmechanism for engaging patients in decision-making about \ntheir healthcare at assessment but also during goal-setting, \ntreatment planning and evaluation. Completion of a PROM \nmight also contribute to helping patients to feel cared for, \nproviding a framework for structuring patients’ discussions \nwith their clinician [15].\nPeople who have communication difficulties are inher -\nently difficult to engage in traditional mechanisms for collab-\norative decision-making [16]. Difficulties in understanding \nspoken or written words as well as physical limitations often \nco-occur in conditions associated with the speech impair -\nments necessitating AAC. These additional difficulties may \nmake the completion of paper questionnaires or engaging in \ninterviews challenging. People who require AAC may also \nhave additional cognitive limitations or learning difficulties \nwhich require adapted materials and information methods \n[17]. Communication interactions may need to be navigated \nvia multi-modal approaches, involving visual and pictorial \nsupport, facilitated by experienced and skilled communi-\ncation partners. The nature of how information is attained \n(i.e. authorship) is critical to understanding the extent to \nwhich the person who uses AAC has truly been involved in \nproviding it.\nImproving collaboration, engagement and person-\ncentredness in AAC service provision has the potential to \nimprove AAC use and reduce the risk that use of the assis-\ntive technology is discontinued by better matching technol-\nogy to the needs and expectations of the individual [18]. \nYet people who have communication difficulties who may \nbenefit from AAC and their families are rarely involved in \ndecision-making relating to AAC [19]. There are no con-\nsistently used patient-reported outcome measures specifi-\ncally for AAC [20]. Neither is there any consensus about \nwhat constitutes a successful outcome from AAC from the \nperspective of the person who uses on it [21]. The lack of \nappropriate support for, or engagement with, people who \nuse AAC can cause frustration, disillusionment and finally \nabandonment of equipment [ 22]. Effective use of suitable \nPROMs by professionals working with people who use AAC \nhas the potential to enable inclusivity by capturing impor -\ntant outcomes, providing targeted training and support, and \nevaluating success from the perspective of the people who \nuse AAC.\nThis systematic review aims to identify:\n1. What tools have been used to collect patient-reported \noutcomes in people who use AAC?\n2. What are the conceptual frameworks, domains of interest \nand validity of the available tools?\n3. What methods are employed to enable authorship (i.e. \ncompletion) of PROMs by people who use AAC?\nMethods\nA systematic review protocol to address the review ques-\ntion was developed and registered on PROSPERO. A list of \nsearch terms related to (a) AAC/AT, (b) PROM and (c) com-\nmunication disorders was generated based on search terms \nused in reviews on similar populations [21]. The search strat-\negy was deliberately broad initially, including terms relating \nto communication and AT, to ensure that all measures were \ncaptured (for a full copy of the search strategy, see PROS-\nPERO: https ://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prosp ero/displ ay_recor \nd.php?Recor dID=80567 ).\nSearches\nDatabases searches were carried out using CINAHL \n(EBSCO), ERIC (ProQuest), MEDLINE (EBSCO), \n2671Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683 \n1 3\nPsycINFO (ProQuest), and Scopus (Elsevier) from incep-\ntion to January 2018.\nInclusion/exclusion\nStudies were included based on meeting the following six \ncriteria: (i) people who had communication difficulties; \n(ii) people aged 12 years old and above (and where data \nfor this population can be disambiguated); (iii) people \nwho had used an external aid to facilitate communication; \n(iv) the tools identified had been used to record outcomes \nfrom the perspective of the person using the aid (includ-\ning but not exclusively: published scales and measures, \nquestionnaires, software, descriptive outcomes, and author \ndeveloped tools), (v) all study types (i.e., qualitative, quan -\ntitative, and mixed methods studies); and finally (vi) all \ncontexts outside of acute and fixed-term rehabilitation \nhospitals. Papers not written in English, where English \ntranslations were not available were excluded for prag-\nmatic reasons. Papers reporting participants as having \nsevere intellectual disability [ 23] and participants who \nhave significant cognitive impairment affecting reasoning \nand judgement were excluded as it was judged that they \nwould be unable to complete a PROM. Participants with \nautistic spectrum disorders (ASD) or social communica-\ntion difficulties were not included as clinicians within the \nreview team decided that outcomes from AAC may be sig-\nnificantly different within this sub-population. Papers con-\ncerning participants who exclusively use gesture (includ-\ning sign language), facial expression, or postures were not \nincluded as they did not include the use of an external \naid to facilitate communication. Papers concerning assis-\ntive devices not commonly issued by AAC services were \nexcluded such as: brain–computer interface; speech recog-\nnition technology; assistive devices for hearing or visual \nimpairment. Papers reporting reviews, editorials, and opin-\nion paper were not included as they were not reporting on \nprimary data.\nScreening\nTitles and abstracts of all papers were screened for rel-\nevance by one author (KB), and 10% of the papers were \nindependently checked by a second author (DH). There \nwas a 5% inclusion/exclusion disagreement between the \nscreeners which was resolved by discussion. Full-text \npapers were screened by the first author and 10% of these \nwere checked by a second author (DH) with no disagree-\nment. The PRISMA flow chart (Fig.  1) summarises the \nscreening process.\nQuality appraisal\nPapers included in the review were appraised for quality \nusing the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) [24]. This \nquality appraisal tool was selected due to the range of study \ntypes included in this review. The MMAT enables reviewers \nto assess the quality of a paper on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4, \ndepending on what information is available in the report. Qual-\nity appraisal was carried out by one author (KB) and checked \nfor consistency by a second author (KS). These two authors \ncompared and discussed independent scoring of the papers \nuntil consensus was agreed.\nData extraction\nData were extracted from the included papers and documented \nin a table designed for the purpose of this review. The table \nwas piloted by two authors (KB, KS) to ensure that it captured \nthe necessary information and to ensure a consistent approach \nwas being used. Data were gathered pertaining to the study \ndetails, methods, participant demographics and characteristics, \nintervention, outcomes, the PROM used (including domains, \nconceptual framework and content validity as reported in the \npaper), and author reported strengths and limitations of the \ntools and study.\nData synthesis\nA complementary approach to data analysis was adopted for \nthis mixed-methods review [25]. A range of data pertaining \nto population characteristics, study type and PROM used, \nwas extracted (Table  1) as well as descriptive data about \nPROMs; validity, authorship (Table 2) and concepts meas-\nured (Table 3). These data enabled analysis on the depth and \nbreadth of information available as opposed to specifically the \ntype or source of the data [25]. The use of complementary \ndata sources (i.e. about the study and the PROM) enabled the \nauthors to construct a narrative synthesis [26] of the range of \nPROMs used with people who use AAC. Once the PROMs \nhad been identified and descriptive data about those PROMs \nhad been extracted, the specific concepts (items measured \nby the PROMs) were tabulated (Table 3). One author (KB) \nreviewed the concepts and carried out a preliminary synthesis \nby grouping them into over-arching domains. These domains \nwere then presented to a second author (KS), the strengths and \nlimitations of the groupings were discussed, and a secondary \nsynthesis was agreed and is presented as a final set of domains \n(see Table 4).\n2672 Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683\n1 3\nResults\nA total of 5453 titles were identified by the search strategy \nafter duplicates were removed. Of these 5453, 84 full text \njournals were read and screened (see PRISMA flow in \nFig.  1 for details). The search resulted in 15 papers that \nmet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this review. These \n15 papers were quality appraised using the MMAT tool. \nOf the 15 papers: five reports scored 0, four reports scored \n1, three reports scored 2, and three reports scored 3. See \nTable 1 for a list of study characteristics and the results of \nthe MMAT appraisal process.\nTools\nTwenty-five instances of PROM use with people who use \nAAC were reported across these 15 studies, comprising 15 \ndifferent published tools. Author-developed tools were used \nin four studies [27–30]. A summary of the characteristics of \nthe PROMs identified by the review can be found in Table 2.\nTen of the 15 PROMs were used with participants who \nrelied on either or both low-tech and high-tech commu-\nnication aids.

For example, the SF-36 \nconsists of items pertaining to eight health concepts: physi-\ncal functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical \nhealth problems, role limitations due to personal or emo-\ntional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, \nenergy/fatigue, and general health perceptions [34]. Follow-\ning synthesis of all the items measured by each tool, nine \nconceptual domains were generated: communication, cogni-\ntion, role, health, quality of life, physical, social, spirituality, \nand AAC equipment. Within each of these domains, several \nsub-domains were created which represent areas of nuance \nor distinction within the main domains. For example, within \n‘health’, there are four sub-domains: general, mental, emo-\ntional well-being, and sleep. In total, 20 individual domains \nor sub-domains were synthesised.\nValidity\nAuthors were rarely explicit about their rationale for select-\ning particular PROMs. For articles that reported on their \nrationale, PROMs were used to capture different aspects of \nAAC technical function and the purposes for which AAC \nwas used. Some papers were evaluating a specific interven-\ntion [28, 29, 35], whereas others were reporting longer-term \noutcomes for AAC [21, 27, 36].\nThe content validity, as reported in the review papers, \nwas extracted but there were no reported instances of tools \nthat have been psychometrically evaluated specifically in \nrelation to people who use AAC. Some authors did how -\never report on their rationale for amending certain PROMs. \nLondral el al. [31] reported that the MQoL has been used in \nvarious studies with people who have Amyotrophic Lateral \nSclerosis (ALS) and that the CETI, a measure for evaluat-\ning functional communication in people with aphasia, has \nbeen demonstrated to be sensitive to changes over time (in a \npopulation of people who have aphasia). However, a modi-\nfied version of the CETI was used in this particular study (to \naccount for its use with a different population) but there was \nno information about whether the modification was also sen-\nsitive to change. The SF-36 has been used widely in health \nresearch and with a range of different conditions but was, \nagain, modified in the study that reported on the validity \nof the tool [34], with no comment about the nature nor the \nvalidity of the modification. The Quality of Life Profile- \nPhysical Disabilities (QOLP-PD) and the communication \nquestionnaire were both used in the study by Hamm and \nTable 2  (continued)\nPROM/tool used Number of \nreports using \ntool\nAetiology/ies\n1 Type of AAC (H = com-\nputer of electronic based \ndevices, L = paper-based \nsystems)\nAggregated \nsample size\nContent validity, as \nreported in the study\nNumber of papers reporting authorship (who \ncompleted the PROM):\nPatient Researcher Collaborative Not reported\nCommunication question-\nnaire\n1 CP Communication book, eye \ngaze (H, L)\n4 Yes 1\nRosser classification \n(modified),\n1 Not specified Computer-based (H) 74 Not reported 1\nNottingham Health Profile \n(NHP)\n1 Not specified Computer-based (H) 74 Yes 1\nMeasure of goal fulfilment 1 Not specified Computer-based (H) 74 Not reported 1\nALS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, CP cerebral palsy, MND motor neurone disease, HD huntington’s disease, PD Parkinson’s, LIS locked in syndrome\na Author developed tools are those that were designed specifically for the study by the authors and have not been published separately\n2678 Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683\n1 3\nTable 3  Items/concepts measured by PROMs (as reported in the review papers)\nPROM Content items\nIPPA Basic needs Sharing new \ninformation\nSocial closeness\nQUEST Satisfaction with \ndevice\nPIADs Functional inde-\npendence\nQoL Well-being Competence Adaptability Self-esteem\nSF36 Physical func-\ntioning\nPhysical role Bodily pain General health Vitality Social function-\ning\nEmotional role Mental health\nQoLP-PD Mental well \nbeing\nPhysical well-\nbeing\nSocial involve-\nment\nCommunity \ninvolvement\nAccess to \nresources\nLife enhancing \nopportunities\nPhysical Psychological Spiritual Social\nCommunication \nsurvey\nCommunication \nwith people\nCommunica-\ntion in specific \nplaces\nCommunication \nfunctions\nICF levels of \nimpairment\nReceptive lan-\nguage\nReading compre-\nhension\nCommunication \ninteraction \nskills\nLinguistic com-\npetency\nFunctional com-\nmunication\nEducation and \nvocational \nachievement\nSelf-determina-\ntion\nQuality of life Contextual fac-\ntors\nNHP Sleep Energy Social isolation Pain\nRosser (modi-\nfied)\nPersonal care Usual activities Communication Pain Satisfaction Dependence\nGoal fulfilment Handling equip-\nment\nFunctional abil-\nity (reading \nand writing)\nActivities or \nroles\nTDQ Physical Sentimental Cognitive\nALS-QoL-r Negative emo-\ntion\nInteraction with \npeople and the \nenvironment\nReligiosity Intimacy Physical symp-\ntoms & bulbar \nfunction\n2679Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683 \n1 3\nTable 4  Synthesis of PROM domains\nPatient \nreported \noutcome \nmeasure\nDomains\nCommunica-\ntion\nCogni-\ntive\nRole Health QoL Physical Social Spir-\nitual\nAAC equipment\nSub-\ndomain:\nLan-\nguage \nSkills\nFunc-\ntion\nActiv-\nities\nActu-\nalisa-\ntion\nGen-\neral\nMen-\ntal\nEmo-\ntional \nwell-\nbeing\nSleep Energy Symp-\ntoms\nPain Inde-\npend-\nence\nFunc-\ntion-\ning\nRela-\ntion-\nships\nCompe-\ntence\nAdapt-\nability\nSatis-\nfaction\nIPPA x x x\nQUEST x\nPIADs x x x x x x\nSF36 x x x x x x x x\nQoLP-\nPD\nx x x x x x x x\nCom-\nmuni-\ncation \nSurvey\nx x x\nICF lev-\nels of \nfunc-\ntioning\nx x x x x x\nNHP x x x x\nRosser \nClassi-\nfication \n(modi-\nfied)\nx x x x x\nMeasure \nof Goal \nfulfil-\nment\nx x x\nTDQ x x x\nALS-\nQoL-r\nx x x x x\n2680 Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683\n1 3\nMirenda [36] and the report cites a previous study which had \nevaluated efficacy of both tools with a similar population, \nbut the sample size of this study was small (nine) so validity \ncannot be ascertained.\nAuthorship\nAuthorship (i.e. who completed the PROM) was extracted, \ncapturing how data gathering was adapted to accommodate \nany physical, cognitive or communication difficulties. There \nwere five examples where the PROMs used were reportedly \ncompleted by the participant directly (Quebec User Evalu-\nation of Satisfaction (QUEST) and Psychosocial Impact of \nAssistive Devices (PIADs) [37]; SF-36 [36, 38]; QOLP-PD \nand International Classification of Functioning (ICP) lev -\nels [21]); six examples where tools were completed by the \nresearcher (author developed tools [28– 30]; CETI-M [32]; \nALS-Qol-r and Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ) \n[39]) and five examples of tools being completed either in \ncollaboration with or by a proxy (QOLP-PD, communica-\ntion questionnaire [36]; Rosser classification, NHP, measure \nof goal fulfilment [33 ]). Six of the studies did not explic -\nitly state who completed the tools used to collect PROMs \n(QUEST [35]; QUEST and PIADs [40]; author developed \ntool [27]; MQoL and CETI-M [31]).\nDiscussion\nThis review confirmed that there are no PROMs specifically \ndeveloped and evaluated for capturing outcomes from peo-\nple who use AAC. Of the PROMs that have been used with \npeople who use AAC, a range of concepts were measured \nbut there was little or no evidence that any of the tools used \nhad been validated for people who use AAC. PROMs were \nnot consistently completed by the study participants and \nthere was scant explanation about any adaptations that had \nbeen made to enable participants to engage directly with the \ntools. The strength of the findings of the research studies in \nthis review is limited by the often-poor quality of reporting. \nNevertheless, some insights about the tools used, the content \nof these tools and the authorship of PROMs in people who \nuse AAC have been identified.\nTools\nThe adaptations to existing, validated PROMs and the \nuse of author-developed tools in studies identified by this \nreview indicate that, despite the lack of suitable tools for \nuse with people who use AAC, attempts are being made \nto capture patient-reported outcome data. A review by \nEnderby [20] also found that there was no single clinician-\nreported outcome measure that was consistently used by \nAAC services within the UK, but that a range of tools \nhad been adopted and adapted for use with this popula-\ntion. The adaptation of tools in both clinical settings and \nresearch studies could indicate that, despite existing tools \nbeing insufficient or unavailable, clinicians and researchers \nare motivated to capture patient-reported outcome data. \nThe current strategic drivers in healthcare in England are \nfocused on empowering patients to become more involved \nin healthcare decision making [11]. These strategies are \nlikely to lead to an increased demand on health services \nto capture the impact of greater patient involvement, using \ntools such as PROMs. Increased interest from clinicians, \nresearchers and policy makers in patient involvement will \ndrive the demand for psychometrically robust PROMs. \nGreater use of PROMs would increase the involvement \nof the person who uses AAC in decision making during \nassessment and also improve the viability of PROMs in the \nmetrics for evaluation.\nContent\nOne of the critical measures of adequacy of PROMs is the \nconceptual framework and the description of the relation-\nships between the items (or domains) and concepts being \nmeasured [12]. The papers included in this review reported \na range of tools that captured a large number of different \nconcepts. The heterogeneity of the PROMs used to cap-\nture various aspects of AAC function and use within this \nreview exemplifies one of the challenges of PROMs and \nAAC—identifying the nature of preferred outcomes. There \nis a lack of clarity about what outcomes are important \nto people who use AAC [21 ] and a range of factors that \ncan affect outcomes. Are positive outcomes in people who \nuse AAC concerned with the function or use of the AAC \ndevices specifically? Or are outcomes concerned with \nthe impact that using AAC has, e.g. on communication, \nrelationships, taking part in activities or independence? \nSeveral papers used more than one PROM. One possible \nadvantage of using a range of measures to record PROMs \nis the opportunity to capture the range of outcomes. This \nmay help researchers to see the “big picture” and illumi-\nnate reports about people who use AAC by highlighting \n‘that AAC in and of itself is not an end goal… [but] can \nbe used as a tool to achieve other goals’ [21, p. 295]. It \nis also important to acknowledge that a range of factors \ncan affect outcomes in people who rely on AAC including \nthe patient’s milieu, personality, cognitive skills and the \ntechnology of the device itself [38]. A clearer understand-\ning about what constitutes important outcomes from the \npeople who use AAC and in what context, is needed in \norder to evaluate whether the tools used in research reflect \nthe priorities of the end users.\n2681Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683 \n1 3\nAuthorship\nThe poor reporting of authorship (i.e., who completed the \nPROM) in this review disguises some of the challenges \nexperienced by people who use AAC and therefore may \nlimit validity of the results. Where studies reported that the \nresearcher completed PROM questionnaires, there was no \nreflection on how this may have influenced the results. In \nstudies where participants had completed PROMs, there was \nlittle detail about how this was made possible. It is important \nto note here that the studies that paid attention to reporting, \nin detail, the collaborative nature of the PROM authorship \nwere rated as higher quality papers overall on the MMAT \ntool. Hamm and Mirenda [36], for example, provide details \nabout the extent to which the participants were able to com-\nplete the questionnaires independently and discussed the \nlimitations inherent in asking questions of people who have \nlimited functional speech. With a research population that \ncannot engage easily in traditional methods of data collec-\ntion, the trustworthiness of the study is strongly correlated \nwith how well adjustments and modifications to methods \nare reported.\nA note about Talking Mats™\nIt is of note that there are no papers reporting the use of \nTalking Mats™ as a patient-reported outcome measure \nincluded in this review. Talking Mats™ is a collaboratively \nproduced, picture or text-based tool that has been used to \ngather opinions and feedback from people who have com-\nmunication difficulties in both research and service settings \n[42]. A report using Talking Mats™ was identified by the \ninitial search terms [41] but was excluded from the review \nduring full-text screening process. This was because data \nrelevant to the review population could not be disambigu -\nated. Talking Mats™ has the unusual quality of being used \nas an AAC device, a research tool and an outcome measure \nin a range of different studies. It is not a PROM per se as the \ncontent is not fixed and therefore not based on a conceptual \nframework [12], nor has it been psychometrically evalu-\nated with a specific population. It does, however, meet the \nrequirements of a large proportion of people who use AAC \nin ways that the PROMs reported in this review do not. It is \na flexible tool that allows for the use of text or pictures. It is \navailable in paper and digital forms and can be completed \nby the person who uses AAC, in collaboration with a com-\nmunication partner or with a trained facilitator who can work \nwith an individual who is employing multiple-modalities \nto communicate [42]. In the absence of a suitable PROM \nfor people who use AAC, a tool that incorporated some of \nthe flexibility and accessibility of Talking Mats™ could be \na useful resource for professionals and services supporting \npeople who use AAC.\nLimitations\nThe overall quality of the reports identified by this review \nwas relatively low which had an impact on the amount of \ndata that could be extracted. Information about authorship \nand the conceptual frameworks for PROMs was variably \nreported, so the discussion of these areas is based on the \nsmall amount of data that it was possible to extract. In sev -\neral of the papers excluded during screening, the research \nteam were unable to disambiguate data about populations or \nage groups of interest from the reports available. As a result, \nthere was insufficient data available to carry out a sub-group \nanalysis of people 12 to 18 years old as was planned in the \noriginal review protocol. The search strategy excluded peo-\nple who had severe intellectual disability, autism or signifi-\ncant cognitive impairment as there is an additional layer of \ncomplexity in using PROMs with these populations which is \nbeyond the scope of this review. These populations do con-\nstitute a significant number of people who use AAC however \nand there would be value in exploring the PROMs employed \nwith these groups in a separate review. The search strategy \nfor this review was large, including terms relating to com-\nmunication impairments and assistive technology, in order to \ncapture PROMs in populations with similar difficulties that \nmay be of interest or value in the field of AAC. Following \ntitle and abstract screening, too many of these reports were \nidentified to be included in this review (see Prisma diagram). \nThe review team decided that this data may instead be useful \nin a complementary review to be analysed at another point \nin time.\nConclusion\nThis review has identified that there is no single patient-\nreported outcome measure suitable for use with people who \nuse AAC. No tool was identified by this review that has \na conceptual framework specifically for AAC, and of the \ntools that have been used, there was limited evidence that the \nnecessary adaptations were made to accommodate the multi-\nmodal nature of communication in people who use AAC. \nClinical services that provide AAC and support people to \nuse AAC cannot therefore consistently capture outcome \ndata from the patient-perspective. Future investigation into \nwhether or not the domains generated during this review, \nfrom the tools that have been used with people who use \nAAC, reflect outcomes that are important to this population \nwill be necessary.\nPROMs can be valuable tools to aid understanding of \nthe impact of a condition, treatment or intervention from \nthe patient’s perspective. They can also improve patient-pro-\nvider communication by facilitating discussion, supporting \ndecision-making and clarifying shared aims for treatment. \n2682 Quality of Life Research (2019) 28:2669–2683\n1 3\nWhen selecting a PROM, the conceptual frameworks of the \ntool need to adequately reflect the priorities of the popula -\ntion of interest. There is currently no consensus about the \nimportant outcomes of AAC from the perspective of the \npeople who use it. The population of people who use AAC \nhave a particular set of needs and requirements to enable \ntheir inclusion in clinical decision making in healthcare and \nin research. The multi-modal and collaborative nature of \ncommunication by and with people who use AAC should \nbe accommodated by developing PROMs that adequately \nreflect the needs and priorities of this population. Acknowl-\nedging the adaptations that have been made during research \nstudies to accommodate people with additional needs, such \nas accurately describing authorship in people with com-\nmunication difficulties, is essential if the results are to be \nconsidered authentic and trustworthy.\nAcknowledgements This report presents independent research funded \nby the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Health Edu-\ncation England (HEE).
