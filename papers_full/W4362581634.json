    "abstract": "Many current approaches for image classification concentrate solely on the most prominent features within an image, but in fine-grained image recognition, even subtle features can play a significant role in model classification. In addition, the large variations in the same class and small differences between different categories that are unique to fine-grained image recognition pose a great challenge for the model to extract discriminative features between different categories. Therefore, we aim to present two lightweight modules to help the network discover more detailed information in this paper. (1) Patches Hidden Integrator (PHI) module randomly selects patches from images and replaces them with patches from other images of the same class. It allows the network to glean diverse discriminative region information and prevent over-reliance on a single feature, which can lead to misclassification. Additionally, it does not increase the training time. (2) Consistency Feature Learning (CFL) aggregates patch tokens from the last layer, mining local feature information and fusing it with the class token for classification. CFL also utilizes inconsistency loss to force the network to learn common features in both tokens, thereby guiding the network to focus on salient regions. We conducted experiments on three datasets, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Oxford 102 Flowers. We achieved experimental results of 91.6%, 92.7%, and 99.5%, respectively, achieving a competitive performance compared to other works.",
