Nassif , Senior Member , IEEE,\nand Benzhe Li , Member , IEEE\nAbstract—Residential transformer population is a critical type\nof asset that many electric utility companies have been attempt-\ning to manage proactively and effectively to reduce unexpected\ntransformer failures and life loss that are often caused by over-\nloading. Within the typical power asset portfolio, the residential\ntransformer asset is often large in population, has the lowest reli-\nability design, lacks transformer loading data, and is susceptible\nto customer loading behaviors, such as adoption of distributed en-\nergy resources and electric vehicles. On the bright side, the avail-\nability of more residential service operation data along with the\nadvancement of data analytics techniques has provided a new path\nto further our understanding of residential transformer overload-\ning risk statistically. This paper develops a new data-driven method\nthat combines transformer temperature rise and insulation life loss\nsimulation model with clustering analysis technique. It quantita-\ntively and statistically assesses the overloading risk of residential\ntransformer population in one area and suggests proper risk man-\nagement measures according to the assessment results. Multiple\napplication examples for a Canadian utility company have been\npresented and discussed in detail to demonstrate the applicability\nand usefulness of the proposed method.\nIndex T erms —Power system reliability, clustering methods,\ntransformers, life estimation, unsupervised learning.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nN\nOW ADA YS, many electric utility companies are seeking\nways to understand and manage their power asset risk.\nUnder deregulated environment, electric utilities are encouraged\nto reduce overall cost while maintaining system reliability risk at\nan acceptable level. Within the typical power asset portfolio, the\neffective assessment and management of residential transformer\nrisk of failure has become particularly important due to the\nfollowing reasons:\nr Residential transformers are often large in population, es-\npecially in urban utilities. As a result, failures of residential\ntransformers are practically difﬁcult to avoid.\nManuscript received May 6, 2018; revised September 22, 2018; accepted\nNovember 15, 2018.

This duration could sometimes lead\nto severe consequence for residential customers, especially\nin extreme weather conditions.\nr The reliability risk of residential transformers is directly\naffected by the loading behaviors of residential customers\n[2]–[4]. In recent years, the adoption of distributed energy\nresources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EVs) further in-\ncreased the uncertainty of the aggregated load behavior at\nthe residential transformer level as the uptake trend con-\ntinues and the customer adoption level has not entered into\na steady stage [5]–[7].\nUnlike the risk assessment of power transformers which has\nbeen researched extensively [8]–[12], it is not costly justiﬁ-\nable to install health monitoring devices on those prevalent\nand low-cost residential transformers and assess risk based on\nmonitoring results. Even the load proﬁles of residential trans-\nformers are not easy to measure directly. The risk assessment\nof residential transformers therefore should aim at developing\na statistical assessment and management approach for the en-\ntire population which many utility companies are not familiar\nwith.\nIn spite of the above challenges, developments in other\nareas have also enabled new ways to residential transformer\nrisk assessment and management. During the past decade,\nthe deployment of smart meters increased the visibility of\nindividual residential services’ loading behavior. In places\nwhere smart meters have not been installed, interval meter data\nare often made available to support statistical analysis such as\nload settlement [13], [14]. These residential service loading data\ncan be aggregated to the transformer level using a bottom-up\napproach. In addition to metering data, other residential oper-\nation related data such as historical weather and temperature\ndata have become readily available in today’s big data era [15],\n[16]. Meanwhile, advanced data analytics methods have been\napplied to power systems. For example, [17] uses a database\nto store typical distribution transformer load proﬁles and the\ncorresponding calculated life loss. Then a new load proﬁle\ncan be classiﬁed with respect to the database proﬁles based\non minimum distance criterion to estimate the life loss; [18]\n0885-8977 © 2018 IEEE.

Flowchart of proposed residential transformer overloading risk assess-\nment.\ndemonstrated the application of clustering analysis to smart\nmeter data for the extraction of appliance-level loading proﬁles.\nThis research proposes a novel statistical data-driven method\nto assess the overloading risk of oil-immersed residential trans-\nformers following the process illustrated in Fig. 1. Currently,\nOil-immersed transformers are the most common residential\ntransformers in Canada and US due to its lower cost, lower\nlosses and more compact sizes [19]. Clustering analysis is ap-\nplied to residential service operation dataset of several recent\nyears in the studied area. The results of clustering analysis have\ntwo parts: one part containing the cluster composition infor-\nmation for this area; the other part containing cluster proﬁles\nthat can be fed into a residential transformer 24-hour simula-\ntion model to produce estimated transformer temperatures and\ninsulation life loss. This outcome, combined with cluster com-\nposition information, can be used for comprehensive overload-\ning risk assessments as discussed in detail in this paper. The\nproposed method can quantitatively and statistically assess resi-\ndential transformer population in one area. Furthermore, proper\nasset management decisions can be developed according to the\nassessment results to mitigate transformer overloading risks.\nThis paper ﬁrstly reviews the factors contributing to residen-\ntial transformer temperature rise and insulation life loss, and\nthen presents an iterative computation model to simulate the\n24-hour residential transformer temperature variation and aging\nbehavior based on speciﬁc input data. It then takes a deep dive\ninto the residential service operation dataset and discusses the\napplication of clustering analysis and how to feed the analysis re-\nsults into the established simulation model to derive desired out-\ncomes for overloading risk assessment and management strate-\ngies. This method has been applied to an actual Canadian utility\ncompany and application examples are presented to illustrate its\napplicability and usefulness.\nII. T\nRANSFORMER TEMPERA TURERISE\nIEEE standard C57.91-2011 explains how residential oil-\nimmersed transformer temperature can be affected by trans-\nformer loading and ambient temperatures [20], [21]. Temper-\nature variables including transformer top-oil temperatures and\nwinding hot-spot temperatures are functions of 24-hour trans-\nformer loading proﬁle and 24-hour ambient temperature proﬁle.\nWith the ambient temperature data and residential service load-\ning data, we can calculate the transformer top-oil temperature\nand hot-spot temperature by following the steps below.\nA. Calculate Transformer Top-Oil Temperature\n∅\nTO = ∅A +Δ ∅TO (1)\nwhere ∅TO is the top-oil temperature, in ◦C; ∅A is the ambient\ntemperature during the load cycle to be studied, in ◦C. In our\ncase, this is the hourly ambient temperature in 24 hours during\na day; Δ∅TO is the top-oil rise over ambient temperature, in ◦C.\nΔ∅TO can be further calculated using the formula below:\nΔ∅TO =( Δ∅TO, U − Δ∅TO, i )( 1− e\n24\nτ TO )+ Δ ∅TO, i (2)\nwhere Δ∅TO, U is the ultimate top-oil rise over ambient tem-\nperature in one hour, in °C; Δ∅TO, i is the initial top-oil rise\nover ambient temperature in one hour, in ◦C; τto is the oil time\nconstant of transformer for any load and for any speciﬁc tem-\nperature differential between the ultimate top-oil rise and initial\ntop-oil rise. This constant is determined by the weight of core\nand coil assembly, weight of tank and ﬁttings and liters of trans-\nformer oil. It can be derived based on transformer speciﬁcations\nprovided by transformer manufacturers.\nΔ∅\nTO, U is given by the following equation:\nΔ∅TO, U =Δ ∅TO, R\n[ (\nK2\nU R +1\n)\n(R +1 )\n] n\n(3)\nwhere Δ∅TO, R is the top-oil rise over ambient temperature at\nrated load on the tap position to be studied, in ◦C.T h i si sa\nconstant based on the transformer speciﬁcations provided by\nmanufactures; Δ∅\nTO, U is the ultimate top-oil rise over ambient\ntemperature for load L, in ◦C; KU is the ratio of ultimate load to\nrated load, in per unit; n is 0.8 for Oil Natural, Air Natural cooled\ntransformers (most distribution oil-immersed transformers); R\nis the ratio of load loss at rated load to no-load loss, which\nis also given in the transformer speciﬁcations provided by the\ntransformer manufacturer.\nIt should be noted, in our case, each hour’s Δ∅TO will be\ncalculated based on the initial Δ∅TO, i which is unknown in\nthe beginning. However, Δ∅TO, i of hour k is also the Δ∅TO\nof hour k − 1. Therefore, Δ∅TO, i in the ﬁrst hour of the day\ncan be initialized to a low temperature number such as 0 °C\nand then both Δ∅TO, i and Δ∅TO of all other 23 hours can be\nupdated. Recurrently, Δ∅TO of the last hour of the day will be\nfed back the ﬁrst hour to replace its initial Δ∅TO, i .This will\nagain trigger the update of the other 23 hours in the day. This\ncomputation continues iteratively until all hours reach a steady\nstage where no signiﬁcant temperature change can be observed.\nThis stage will indicate the ﬁnal expected top-oil temperatures\nof all 24 hours in this daily cycle.\n\u00001\u00003\u00009\nDONG et al.: DA TA-DRIVEN RESIDENTIAL TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD 389\nTABLE I\nTRANSFORMER TEMPERA TURELIMITS AS PER IEEE S TANDARD C57.91-2011\nB. Calculate Transformer Winding Hottest-Spot Temperature\nThe winding hottest-spot temperature is obtained by solving\n{ ∅H = ∅A +Δ ∅TO +Δ ∅H\nΔ∅H =( Δ∅H,U − Δ∅H,i )\n(\n1 − e\n24\nτ W\n)\n+Δ ∅H,i\n(4)\nwhere ∅H is the winding hottest-spot temperature, in ◦C; Δ∅H\nis the winding hottest-spot rise over top-oil temperature, in ◦C;\nΔ∅H,U is the ultimate winding hottest-spot rise over top-oil\ntemperature in one hour, in ◦C; Δ∅H,i is the initial winding\nhottest-spot rise over top-oil temperature in one hour, in ◦C.τW\nis the winding time constant at hot spot location which can be\nprovided by the transformer manufacturer.\nΔ∅H,U is given by the following equation:\nΔ∅H,U =Δ ∅H,R K2m\nu (5)\nwhere Δ∅H,R is a constant called hotspot differential and can\nbe provided by the transformer manufacturer; KU is the ratio of\nultimate load L to rated Load, per unit; m is 0.8 for Oil Natural,\nAir Natural cooled transformers.\nSimilar to the iterative computation process illustrated for the\ncalculation of top-oil temperatures in Section II-A, the 24-hour\nwinding hotspot temperatures can be calculated provided the\n24-hour loading and ambient temperature proﬁles.\nC. Residential Transformer Temperature Limits Suggested by\nIEEE Standard C57.91-2011\nIEEE standard C57.91-2011 suggests that the above calcu-\nlated transformer top-oil temperatures and winding hottest-spot\ntemperatures do not exceed the limits speciﬁed in Table I to\nprevent transformer failures. These limits can be used as safety\nthresholds for residential transformer loading assessment. Ex-\nceeding these limits due to overloading should not be allowed.\nIII. R\nESIDENTIAL TRANSFORMER INSULA TIONLIFE\nTransformer insulation life is also affected by transformer\nloading and ambient temperature. Experimental evidence indi-\ncates that the relation of insulation deterioration to time and\ntemperature follow an adaption of Arrhenius reaction rate the-\nory [21]. IEEE standard C57.91-2011 suggests calculating the\nhourly aging acceleration factor F\nAA,n and daily equivalent\naging factor FEQA by using the equations below:\n{\nFAA,n = e\n[\n15000\n383 − 15000\n∅H,n +273\n]\nFEQA =\n∑ 24\nn =1 FAA,n\n24\n(6)\nwhere ∅H,n is the winding hottest-spot temperature in ◦C for\nnth hour in 24-hour period, which could be calculated using the\nmethods discussed in Section II.\nFig. 2. Example of residential transformer 24-hour simulation results.\nEquivalent aging factor FEQA . indicates the effective aging\ntime within a 24-hour window. Normal operation expects equiv-\nalent aging factor to be one. For instance, if equivalent aging\nfactor is 2, it means the transformer ages by 2 days under normal\noperating condition in one natural day. Using these equations,\nwe can estimate the loss of transformer insulation life in any\ngiven period of time such as one year. This can also be used\nas a criterion for assessing residential transformer overloading\nrisk. In addition, loss in transformer insulation life can be fur-\nther converted to monetary loss based on the material and labor\ncosts of purchasing and installing a residential transformer.\nIV . R\nESIDENTIAL TRANSFORMER SIMULA TN\nA residential transformer simulation model is established to\nimplement calculations discussed in Section II and III. This\ncomputation process uses the following data as input:\nr Transformer manufacturer data: weight of core and coil\nassembly, weight of tank and ﬁttings, liters of transformer\noil, top-oil rise over ambient temperature at rated load,\nratio of load loss at rated load to no-load loss, winding\ntime constant at hot spot location;\nr 24-hour load proﬁle: the per-unit loading value for each\nhour for a speciﬁc transformer. If the number of services\nconnected to the transformer is given, the 24-hour load\nproﬁle is equal to the diversiﬁed service load proﬁle mul-\ntiplied by the number of services;\nr 24-hour ambient temperature in °C.\nThrough the iterative computation process explained in\nSection II, this model outputs 24-hour top-oil temperature pro-\nﬁle, winding hottest-spot temperature proﬁle and aging acceler-\nated factor proﬁle. An example of the output is shown in Fig. 2.\nV. A PPLYING CLUSTERING ANALYSIS TO RESIDENTIAL\nSERVICE OPERA TIONDA TASET\nApplying clustering analysis to historical residential service\noperation dataset is the key step in the proposed transformer\noverloading risk assessment method. Clustering is the task of\ngrouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same\ngroup (cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in\nother groups (clusters). Clustering is an important unsupervised\n\u00001\u00004\u00000\n390 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 34, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2019\nlearning technique that can be used for statistical data analysis\n[28]. It is applied to the residential service operation dataset in\norder to:\nr evaluate the internal similarities between data points and\nautomatically restructure the dataset to group similar load\nproﬁles under similar weather conditions on similar calen-\ndar days;\nr study the composition of each cluster and understand the\nrisk levels of transformers at different times of year or\nunder different operational conditions;\nr extract typical 24-hour load and ambient temperature pro-\nﬁles from each cluster to calculate the corresponding trans-\nformer temperatures and insulation life loss to support fur-\nther risk assessment.\nA. Description of Residential Service Operation Dataset\nFor a speciﬁc area, the residential service operation dataset\ncontains the historical operational condition data and loading\ndata from selected residential metered services. It is deﬁned to\nconsist of three categories of data as follows.\n1) Historical Weather Data: References [22]–[25] indicate\nthat weather can signiﬁcantly alter the residential loading be-\nhavior. For example, in hot summer days, air conditioning can\nbe heavily used while in cold winter days, electric or gas-ﬁred\nfurnaces will run more frequently in residential houses. Gas\nfurnaces consume much less energy than electric heaters, but\nstill use electricity to constantly circulate hot and cold air. Cold\nand hot ambient temperatures may also change occupants’ be-\nhaviors because they may tend to stay home when it is cold or\nhot outside and this behavior often lead to increased residential\nloading. 24-hour ambient temperature data is required for trans-\nformer temperature and insulation life calculation as explained\nin Section II and III. This data is often available from govern-\nment or weather stats websites [15]. Precipitation like rain or\nsnow could also affect people’s tendencies to stay indoor or out-\ndoor [26]. In some areas such as Scandinavia, the duration of\ndaylight change signiﬁcantly between seasons and also affects\npeople’s behavior at home. In general, the selection of weather\nfeatures should be based on the local conditions in the studied\narea. Also, multiple years of weather data should be used to\nderive statistically meaningful results. This is because weather\ndata in one area could vary between years [22], [23].\n2) Historical Calendar Data: Weekdays, weekends as well\nas statutory holidays could result in very different residen-\ntial load proﬁles [22], [25], [26]. For example, in some areas,\nthe average daytime consumption during weekdays is typically\nlower than that in the weekends, and in the evening the aver-\nage consumption is somewhat higher than that in the weekend\nevenings [22].\n3) Historical Meter Data: As discussed above, weather and\ncalendar data will signiﬁcantly affect average residential load\nbehavior. However, load behavior could also vary under similar\nweather conditions and on similar calendar days. For example,\none day in September may have similar weather conditions as\none day in August and they are both workdays, however the\nloading on the day in August could be much higher than the day\nin September because in August children could be taking sum-\nmer break and spending more time at home, while in September\nthey could be going to school [26]. Other drivers for change\ninclude the adoption of energy efﬁcient appliances such as LED\nlights [26], the adoption of new appliances, such as EV charg-\ners [7], over time. This behavioral difference can be reﬂected\ndirectly on residential metering data.\nInterval meters or smart meters are measuring the continu-\nous power demand of connected residential services and can\nprovide 24-hour service load proﬁles. This can be used to pro-\nduce transformer load proﬁle as explained in Section IV. Some\nconsiderations to be accounted for are:\nr It is not necessary and could be computationally pro-\nhibitive to utilize every residential house’s metering data in\nthe studied area. Depending on the availability of interval\nmeters or smart meters a utility company has installed and\nthe size of the studied area, the required number of meters\ncould vary;\nr To be statistically representative, it is recommended to\ncollect metering data from different residential commu-\nnities across the studied area instead of being concen-\ntrated in one or two residential communities. This is to en-\nsure the extraction of statistically unbiased residential load\nbehaviors;\nr The metering data should span over multiple years. This\nis to match the requirement of using multi-year ambient\ntemperature data.\nr There are areas where no interval meters or smart meters\nare installed. Traditional revenue meters only record cu-\nmulative energy consumption change between readings.\nThe energy consumption data can be converted to average\nloading data for a certain period of time but cannot provide\ncontinuous 24-hour load proﬁles. For transformers in an\narea like this, this section proposes a Euclidian distance\nbased method in the end to leverage the assessment results\nin another similar area that has continuous load proﬁles to\nestimate the transformers in the target area.\nB. Basics of K-Means Clustering\nK-Means clustering is selected as the unsupervised learn-\ning method to process the above residential service operation\ndataset. K-Means method is a very popular unsupervised cluster-\ning method for dealing with large datasets with great efﬁciency\nand simplicity [28]–[31]. It only requires one parameter k which\nis deﬁned as the expected number of clusters produced from\nthe clustering process. The mathematic description of K-Means\nclustering is stated as below.\nGiven a set of observations (X\n1,X 2,...,X n ), where each\nobservation is a d-dimensional real vector, K-Means cluster-\ning aims to partition the observations into k (/2264n)s e t sS =\n{S\n1,S 2,...,S k } so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of\nsquares (i.e., variance). Formally, the objective is to ﬁnd:\nargmin\ns\nk∑\ni=1\n∑\nx∈Si\n∥x−μi∥\n2\n=a r gmin\ns\nk\n∑\ni=1\n|Si| Var Si (7)\nwhere μi is the mean of Si [27].\n\u00001\u00004\u00001\nDONG et al.: DA TA-DRIVEN RESIDENTIAL TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD 391\nFig. 3. Example of clustering results using two features Tavg and\nLavg (k = 5).\nFor the residential service operation dataset, an example of a\nfeature vector ( FV) for a historical day is given as below.\nFV =\n(\nTmax ,Tmin ,Tavg ,L max ,Lmin ,Lavg ,\nCrain ,C weekday\n)\n(8)\nIn this example, for a given date, the maximum, minimum\nand average daily ambient temperatures and loading levels are\nrecorded into the feature vector FV. In addition, FV has two\ncategorical features to indicate how rainy the day is and if it\nis a weekday. In practice, the selection of features depends on\nfeature data availability, the variation of feature data and the\nsensitivity of feature data to the clustering results.\nThe standard steps of K-Means clustering are:\nr Step 1: Initialize k centroids randomly within the data\ndomain;\nr Step 2: Associate all data points to their nearest centroids.\nThis will create k data clusters. Each cluster contains the\nassociated data points as its members;\nr Step 3: Update the centroid of each cluster using all mem-\nbers in the cluster;\nr Step 4: Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until convergence has\nbeen reached.\nFor the purpose of concept illustration, the clustering result\nof using only features Tavg and Lavg for 365 records is plotted\nin Fig. 3. As can be seen, all 365 records were grouped into 5\nclusters.\nC. Modiﬁed K-Means Clustering to Deal With Categorical\nData\nResidential service operation dataset could include categor-\nical data to describe weather and calendar conditions. Orderly\ncategorical data such as moderate, medium, severe can be con-\nverted into numerical values using (9):\nx = i − 1/2\nN ,i =1 ,2...N (9)\nwhere N is the total orderly statuses, i is the order of the\nstatus [28].\nAnother type of categorical data is simply indicating un-\nordered statuses such as yes or no. This would require the mod-\niﬁcation of dissimilarity calculation in the standard K-means\nalgorithm, which is based on Euclidian distance. The modiﬁed\ndissimilarity calculation between condition feature vector X and\nY would look like:\n⎧\n⎪⎨\n⎪⎩\nd (X,Y )= ∑\np\nj=1 (xj − yj )2 + ∑ m\nj=p+1\nδ (xj ,yj )\nδ (xj ,yj )=\n{\n0,(xj = yj )\n1,(xj ̸= yj )\n(10)\nwhere x1 to xp and y1 to yp are all numerical features and\nxp +1 to xm and yp +1 to ym are unordered categorical fea-\ntures. If two unordered categorical features match, the distance\nof categorical features is 0; otherwise, it is 1 [31].\nD. Normalization and Weightings of Condition Features\nTo effectively apply K-means clustering, all features should\nbe normalized to a numerical range (e.g., [0, 1]). This is because\nthe raw residential service operation data use different units and\nthe magnitude differences of different features can be quite large.\nThere are many ways of normalizing raw features, for example,\nthe Min-Max normalization can be described as below:\nxnorm = xraw − Min\nMax − Min (11)\nwhere for a give dataset, Max is the maximum value observed\nin feature j; Min is the minimum value observed in feature j\n[28]–[30].\nIn addition to normalization, different weighting factors can\nbe assigned to the dissimilarity formula when applying K-Means\nclustering:\nd (X,Y )=\np∑\nj=1\nwj (xj − yj )2 +\nm∑\nj=p+1\nwj δ (xj ,yj ) (12)\nwhere wj is the empirical weighting factor for feature j. For\nexample, in places where temperatures do not vary much or\nno heating or cooling devices are used in residential units, the\nweightings on temperature features can be lowered accordingly.\nE. Clustering Composition\nFollowing the above steps, with the produced clustering re-\nsults, utility asset management engineers can:\nr examine the data points in each cluster to understand the\ndistribution of dates inside each cluster;\nr calculate the centroid of clusters. The centroid of a cluster\nis the averaged feature vector from all members in the\ncluster and is an indication of the average loading behavior\nand operation conditions of all members in the cluster.\n\u00001\u00004\u00002\n392 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 34, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2019\nFig. 4. The proposed method of leveraging existing cluster centroids to esti-\nmate new transformer service X based on d(X,C i ).\nF . Cluster Proﬁles and Residential Transformer Simulation\nFor each cluster, the 24-hour load and ambient temperature\nproﬁles representing the common behaviors within the cluster\ncan be extracted and these proﬁles are named as cluster proﬁles.\nThe cluster proﬁles can be calculated by averaging the pro-\nﬁles of all members within the cluster or averaging the proﬁles\nof a number of randomly selected members within the cluster.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, a cluster proﬁle can be scaled up by the\nnumber of services connected to the transformer. The scaled\nproﬁle is then fed into the residential transformer 24-hour sim-\nulation model established in Section IV to estimate transformer\ntemperature rises and life losses. Combined with the cluster\ncomposition results, utility asset management engineers can:\nr determine the transformer loading thresholds throughout a\nyear;\nr rank the clusters based on their impact on transformers;\nr given the number of residential services n, calculate the\ntransformer temperatures and life loss for each cluster.\nr given the number of residential services n, estimate tem-\nperatures for a new transformer that has n services and\nan average service feature vector X. The equation is de-\nveloped based on the similarities of X with respect to all\ncluster centroids measured by Euclidian distances:\nTx,n =\nk∑\ni=1\nTi,n\n(\n1/d(X,C i)∑ k\ni=1 1/d(X,C i)\n)\n(13)\nwhere k is the total number of existing clusters; Ti,n is the trans-\nformer temperature under an existing cluster i with n residential\nservices; d(X,C i) is the Euclidian distance of feature vector X\nto existing cluster centroid Ci.\nThe meaning of (13) is explained with respect to Fig. 4. Intu-\nitively, if the given feature vector X i sv e r yc l o s et oa ne x i s t i n g\ncluster centroid Ci, X’s load proﬁle and ambient temperature\nproﬁle should also be very close to Ci’s load proﬁle and tem-\nperature proﬁle. This implies that the resulted transformer’s\ntemperature should be very close to Ti,n .In this case, Euclidian\ndistance d(X,C i) will be close to zero and (13) would end up\nto be Tx,n ≈ Ti,n . In another case where X is surrounded by all\nclusters, Tx,n will be the average weighted by the similarities\nbetween X and all cluster centroids. This method could provide\nreasonable approximation if X is not far away from all clusters.\nIf X is far away from all clusters, this means X is not part of the\nestablished learning model and therefore should not rely on this\nmethod to estimate. Geographically, this suggests transformer\nX should only be in the studied area or areas which have similar\nweather and electricity use characteristics compared to the orig-\ninally studied area. For a provincial or national utility company\nowning multiple similar geographic areas, this is often the case.\nIn contrast to this, a cluster model developed based on tropical\nareas should not be applied to transformers in cold areas; a clus-\nter model characterizing electricity uses in house-concentrated\nareas should not be applied to condo-concentrated areas.\nr Similar to estimating transformer temperatures, given a\nnumber of residential services n, the insulation life loss of\na new transformer X can be estimated too. Equation (13)\nnow becomes:\nl\nx,n =\nk∑\ni=1\nli,n\n1/d(X,C i)∑ k\ni=1 1/d(X,C i)\n) (14)\nwhere k is the total number of existing clusters; li,n is the trans-\nformer insulation life loss under cluster i with n residential\nservices; d(X,C i) is the Euclidian distance of feature vector X\nto existing centroid Ci.\nVI. A PPLICA TIONEXAMPLE\nThe proposed method was recently applied to a utility com-\npany in West Canada. Multiple application examples are pro-\nvided in this section to explain the process and outcomes of the\nproposed method. The residential service operation dataset used\nin this section includes:\nr Local hourly ambient temperature data in a City from 2014\nto 2016;\nr Calendar data from 2014 to 2016;\nr Hourly loading data from 125 residential metered services\nacross the city from 2014 to 2016.\nA. Determine the Members and Centroids of Clusters\nFirst, the above described dataset was processed to extract\n5 features for all 125 services from 2014 to 2016 on a daily\nbasis. These 5 features are maximum daily ambient tempera-\nture, minimum daily ambient temperature, average daily ambi-\nent temperature and the weekday/weekend categorical feature.\nThe total number of records used in this analysis is 137,000\n(1096 days times 125 services). Then the ﬁrst 4 non-categorical\nfeatures were normalized using (11). In the end these features\nwere taken into the steps described in Section V-B for K-means\nclustering. It should be noted due to the presence of one cate-\ngorical feature, modiﬁed Euclidean distance (10) is chosen for\ncalculating dissimilarities between data points. Table II summa-\nrizes the produced cluster composition information. The total of\n137,000 data points were automatically grouped into 10 clusters\nbased on their similarities deﬁned by the 5 features. The cen-\ntroid values of clusters are also listed in Table II to indicate the\ncommon characteristics of each cluster’s members. In practice,\nthe number of clusters can be estimated by human experts with\nsome prior knowledge on the intrinsic or desired structure of the\ninput data [32]. In this example, the whole year temperature is\nestimated to have 5 distinct levels: extremely low, low, medium,\n\u00001\u00004\u00003\nDONG et al.: DA TA-DRIVEN RESIDENTIAL TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD 393\nTABLE II\nCLUSTER COMPOSITION INFORMA TION\nTABLE III\nTRANSFORMER THRESHOLD AND CLUSTER IMPACT RANKING BY\nMAXIMUM 24-HOUR PEAK LOADING (p.u.)\nhigh and extremely high. This multiplied by the binary week-\nday/weekend attribute yields 10 clusters in total. However, in\nanother geographic area where more weather conditions could\naffect residential loading behavior, the required number of clus-\nters may need to increase to reﬂect the nuances. For example,\nin some places, rains are frequent throughout a whole year. It\nmay be wise to consider additional number of clusters to reﬂect\nlow rain, medium rain and heavy rain scenarios. Another way\nto determine the number of clusters is to initialize a number and\nincrease it gradually to an extent that no signiﬁcant change is\nobserved from the assessment results. Depending on the size of\nthe dataset, this method can be very computational intensive.\nB. Determine the Transformer Loading Thresholds and Rank\nCluster Impact\nThe cluster proﬁles were then extracted and taken into a\n25 kV A residential transformer 24-hour simulation model estab-\nlished by following Section IV. The loading proﬁle was scaled\nup gradually until either the top-oil temperature limit or winding\nhottest-spot temperature was reached. In this example, top-oil\ntemperature limit was used as the overloading criterion. The\ncorresponding transformer average loading and peak loading in\nper unit were recorded. The results are shown in Table III. Each\ncluster’s impact level was ranked by the magnitude of peak load-\ning. It indicates the sensitivity of transformer temperature and\nlife loss to loading. For instance, it is found out Cluster 6 can\nonly go up to 2.19 per unit. With reference to Table II, it is found\nthat this cluster represents hot days because all the temperature\nfeature values are high; the impact on transformer temperature\nTABLE IV\nNUMBER OF DAY S I N 12 M ONTHS IN EACH CLUSTER\n∗Imp N represents the cluster with impact level N as per Table III.\nFig. 5. Number of days in 12 months in each cluster.\nis low for clusters 9 and 4 because of their low ambient temper-\natures. Between these two, Cluster 4’s impact is further lower\nthan Cluster 9 because all its members are weekdays which draw\na lower average loading than that of Cluster 9 during weekends.\nThe results in Table III also suggest that throughout a year, the\nminimum allowed daily peak loading is 2.19 p.u. The utility\ncompany can therefore use this value as a conservative loading\nthreshold for residential transformers in the City. If a residential\ntransformer’s average loading frequently exceeds 2.19 p.u., an\nalarm can be triggered for further investigation.\nC. Calculate the Number of Days in Each Month in Each\nCluster\nBased on the impact ranking of Table III, we can further\nexamine the dates of the members inside each cluster and the\nresults are summarized in Table IV and Fig. 5. A clear pattern\nwas revealed in this study: high impact level clusters have large\nconcentrations in summer months; the impact level decreases as\nthe dates move away from hottest summer months. For instance,\nCluster 7 and 8 have almost zero members from June to August;\nthe lowest impact-level clusters came from winter months (De-\ncember to March). This suggests that the combined effect of\nloading and ambient temperature in winter months is found to\nbe less harmful to the transformers. On the contrary, the summer\nmonths June, July and August are statistically more harmful.\n\u00001\u00004\u00004\n394 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 34, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2019\nThe numbers of days were also summed for each impact level.\nIt shows that high-impact days are signiﬁcantly more than the\nlow-impact days in the studied area. For example, Imp 1 to Imp\n3 (Clusters 6, 2 and 3) account for 44% of the total days. If the\nsum of days is used as the weighting factor, the weighted aver-\nage impact level is close to 4. Imp 4 is corresponding to Cluster\n8 as per Table III. This suggests if no other information is pro-\nvided, as a general rule of thumb, the peak loading of residential\ntransformers in this area should be kept below 2.39 p.u.\nMore granular monthly or seasonal assessment can also be\nmade from this type of analysis based on the clustering results to\nproduce proper risk management actions. Although monitoring\ntransformer loading individually is not very practical, almost all\nutility companies have the capability of monitoring feeder-level\nloading through SCADA system nowadays [33]. For a residen-\ntial feeder, based on the feeder-level loading and the number\nof residential transformers connected to the feeder, the average\nresidential transformer loading could be estimated. As shown in\nFig. 4, since most of the days in June, July and August belong to\nCluster 6 with the highest impact level (i.e., Imp1), the average\npeak loading threshold should not exceed 2.19 p.u. If 2.19 p.u\nis frequently exceeded, this is an indication that statistically the\ntransformers on this feeder will be prone to fail due to over-\nloading. Proactive measures can be taken for this feeder. For\nexample, transformers on this feeder may need to be upgraded\nto larger sizes such as from 25 kV A to 37.5 kV A. The upgrades\ncan be prioritized to start from transformers with more service\nconnections until the observed average transformer loading gets\nreduced to below 2.19 p.u. Another proactive measure can be\ninstalling new transformers adjacent to existing transformers to\nshare the service connections. This will also reduce the average\ntransformer loading and the potential failure risk.\nAlternatively, instead of investing capital to upgrade or in-\nstall transformers on the concerning feeder, the company could\nalso consider incenting the residential customers on this feeder\nto reduce load especially during peak hours. This can be re-\nalized by implementing time-of-use rates in different months\nand different time of a week [34]–[36]. For example, it is found\nin Table II that Cluster 6 is weekday. Therefore, the rates dur-\ning the weekday peak hours in June, July and August can be\nset higher to encourage spontaneous peak shaving behaviours.\nFurthermore, the utility company could consider incenting cus-\ntomers on this feeder to install more DERs such as roof-top\nPV panels to offset the demand and reduce the loading on their\nconnected residential transformers.\nSimilarly, as show in Fig. 5, Cluster 10 with Impact-level 8 is\nthe most dominant cluster (with tallest bar) in December. Proac-\ntive measures can be designed to ensure the average residential\ntransformer peak loading on a feeder does not exceed 2.65 p.u\nin December, as speciﬁed in Table III.\nD. Determine the Maximum Allowed Number of Services Per\nResidential Transformer by Temperatures\nAssuming N services are connected to a transformer , the\ntransformer’s load proﬁle can be calculated as the cluster load\nproﬁle multiplied by service number N. Again, using the res-\nidential transformer 24-hour simulation model, the maximum\nTABLE V\nNUMBER OF SERVICES N AND TRANSFORMER MAXIMUM TOP-OIL\nTEMPERA TURE(◦C) FOR 25 kV A TRANSFORMER\ntop-oil temperatures or winding hottest-spot temperatures can\nbe calculated. A table like Table V can be developed to test\ndifferent service numbers. It shows the maximum top-oil tem-\nperatures resulted from different service numbers. Since 120 °C\nis the suggested operating limit for top-oil temperature, it is\nclear that statistically the maximum number of services should\nnot exceed 23 for the simulated 25 kV A transformer model in the\nCity. This ﬁnding can be implemented as a transformer installa-\ntion and design requirement to prevent new transformers from\nconnecting with more than 23 services. This way, harmful over-\nloading level can be avoided in the ﬁrst place. This can also be\nused to identify existing overloaded transformers that have more\nthan 23 services in the population. As discussed in Section VI-C,\nthese transformers can be either upgraded or equipped with ad-\nditional transformers in adjacency so that their loadings can get\ndown below the thresholds.\nE. Determine the Maximum Allowed Number of Services Per\nResidential Transformer by Loss of Life\nSimilar to the study in Section VI-D , transformer loss of life\ncan be calculated for different numbers of services connected to\none transformer. The normal life of a distribution transformer\nis 20.55 years according to [20]. A utility company can deter-\nmine a desired limit for the average annual loss of life such as\n400 days; it can further set a desired economic threshold based\non the purchase and installation cost of a new transformer. In\nthis case study, the transformer purchase and installation cost is\nassumed to be $5,000 and the company decided the maximum\nacceptable economic loss per transformer is $500/year. Equiva-\nlent economic loss for each service number is calculated using\nthe formula below:\nEL = L\nA\n7500 × C (15)\nWhere LA is the average annual loss of life calculated in\nTable VI; C is the cost of purchasing and installing a new\ntransformer, in this case assumed to be $5,000. 7500 is the nor-\nmal life expectancy in days required by standard [20] (equiv-\nalent to 20.55 years) in a constant 30 °C ambient temperature\nwith a continuous loading at transformer’s rated kV A. In prac-\ntice, both the temperature and loading level ﬂuctuate as shown\nin Fig. 2 and the corresponding aging process will be almost\n\u00001\u00004\u00005\nDONG et al.: DA TA-DRIVEN RESIDENTIAL TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD 395\nTABLE VI\nNUMBER OF SERVICES N AND TRANSFORMER LIFE\nLOSS FOR 25 kV A TRANSFORMER\nTABLE VII\nESTIMA TEDMAXIMUM TOP-OIL TEMPERA TURE FOR TRANSFORMER X\nalways accelerated or decelerated, which would result in a\nshorter or longer lifespan.\nSince the maximum acceptable economic loss per transformer\nis set to be $500/year, from Table VI the corresponding max-\nimum allowed number of services should be 21 ($456.0/year).\nStatistically, when the number of services is less than 21, the\naverage annual loss of life will be less than 680.4 days and the\nequivalent economic loss will be less than $456.0/year. Again,\nthis can be implemented as a transformer installation and design\nrequirement for this area or vice versa, used to identify existing\noverloaded transformers supplying more than 21 services and\nmitigate them proactively, as discussed previously.\nF . Estimate Transformer Temperatures and Loss of Life for\nTransformers in a Different Area\nAs discussed in Section V, (13) and (14) can be used to es-\ntimate the maximum top-oil temperatures, winding hottest-spot\ntemperatures and insulation life loss of a transformer located\nin a different area that shares similar weather and electric-\nity use characteristics to this city. The established clusters in\nSection VI-A can be leveraged in this application. An example\nis shown in Table VII. First, the maximum ambient temperature,\nminimum ambient temperature and average ambient tempera-\nture during seven days in this new area were collected. The\nservice revenue meters under transformer X are not equipped\nwith interval meters and cannot therefore acquire or record con-\ntinuous loading data. However, almost all residential revenue\nmeters acquire and record the cumulative energy consumption.\nAfter each day, the increased energy consumption can be con-\nverted to average service loading (i.e.L\navg ) using the formula\nbelow:\nLavg =\n∑ n\ni Ei\n24n (16)\nwhere Ei is the daily energy consumption in kWH recorded\nfrom each service revenue meter; n is the number of service\nconnections under transformer X.\nTaking one step further, multiple transformers under a wider\ntimespan in this area can be estimated in the same way, for\nexample for a month or a year. The estimated maximum top-\noil temperatures can be compared to the transformer limits in\nTable II to identify the overloaded ones. Similar to estimating\ntransformer temperatures, following (14), the loss of life for\ntransformer X can be estimated too.\nAfter repeating the above process for more transformer sam-\nples in this new area, a statistical view of the residential trans-\nformer population in this area can be developed. This type of\nanalysis was not possible without using the proposed data-driven\nmethod because the services in this area do not have interval\nmeters or smart meters. As a result, there is no continuous\nmeasurement data to support the transformer temperature and\naging simulation as discussed in Section IV. Now the proposed\nmethod leveraged the clustering results generated in a differ-\nent area for this area based on readily available data such as\nambient temperature and average service loading. Ultimately,\nrisk management measures can be developed for this area to\neither upgrade or replace overloaded transformers to maintain\nthe transformer temperatures and losses of life at a desired level.\nVII. C\nONCLUSION\nThis paper presents a data-driven method for residential\ntransformer overloading risk assessment. Compared to previ-\nous works, this method has the following advantages:\nr It is reliant on residential service operation data and does\nnot require transformer health or load monitoring devices;\nr It provides statistical insights for the overloading risk of\nresidential transformer population in one area;\nr Many types of assessment results can be produced and\nconverted to effective risk management measures.\nThe proposed method was applied to a utility company in\nWest Canada and provided great value to its asset management\nengineers. Detailed application examples and discussions are\ngiven to demonstrate the practical application of this method.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] A. A. Chowdhury and D. O.
