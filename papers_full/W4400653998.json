    "abstract": "The diffusion of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has opened new research directions in the context of video content understanding and classification. Emotion recognition from videos aims to automatically detect human emotions such as anxiety and fear. It requires deeply elaborating multiple data modalities, including acoustic and visual streams. State-of-the-art approaches leverage transformer-based architectures to combine multimodal sources. However, the impressive performance of MLLMs in content retrieval and generation offers new opportunities to extend the capabilities of existing emotion recognizers. This paper explores the performance of MLLMs in the emotion recognition task in a zero-shot learning setting. Furthermore, it presents a state-of-the-art architecture extension based on MLLM content reformulation. The performance achieved on the Hume-Reaction benchmark shows that MLLMs are still unable to outperform the state-of-the-art average performance but, notably, are more effective than traditional transformers in recognizing emotions with an intensity that deviates from the average of the samples.",
