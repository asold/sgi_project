In their seminal monkey study,\nRizzolatti and colleagues [2,3] defined the“peripersonal space” (PPS) as the sector of space\ncoded by neurons responding to both tactile and visual stimuli near the body. Since then, many\nauthors refer to the PPS as an action space that offers a multisensory interface for body– objects\ninteractions [4,5] somewhat overlapping the reaching space [6– 9]. Yet, in our environment we\ninteract not only with inanimate objects, but also with other people. Typically, humans main-\ntain a distance around their bodies, called“interpersonal space” (IPS), any intrusion into which\nby others may cause discomfort [10,11]. Both PPS and IPS are plastic: for instance, PPS is\n‘lengthened’ by tool use [12– 14], whereas IPS can be modified by emotional and socially rele-\nvant interactions [15,16].\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0154247 May 4, 2016 1/1 2\na11111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Patané I, Iachini T, Farnè A, Frassinetti F\n(2016) Disentangling Action from Social Space: Tool-\nUse Differently Shapes the Space around Us.

The funders had no role\nin study design, data collection and analysis, decision\nto publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nIn this regard, it has been demonstrated that social interactions between confederates can\nalso modulate the plastic boundary of PPS [17]. After an economic interaction, for example,\nthe participant’s PPS boundary extended to include the partner at a distance, but only if the\nconfederate behaved cooperatively. In fact, merely knowing that the seen partner acts upon\nevents near one's body has been shown to influence the visual-tactile integration in the PPS\n[18]. This“social” influence was thus interpreted as due to a top-down modulation on the sen-\nsorimotor representations of PPS. Accordingly, more complex social information, such as per-\nceived morality of another person, can exert a top-down influence on PPS regulation [19].\nIn the light of this recent evidence showing that PPS is sensitive to some social factors, the\nquestion has been raised as to whether PPS and IPS share some functional features [20]. The\nidea is emerging that functional links, or maybe even functional identity, may exist between the\naction-related and the social-related space. Our rationale for testing this hypothesis is that,\nwere this true, any sensory-motor plastic change induced in the PPS representation should\nconcurrently modulate the IPS one. To this aim, here we applied a tool-use paradigm, known\nto modify both near-body space perception and arm length representation [21– 25], to assess\nwhether PPS and IPS are similarly affected, or not. In order to compare tool-use effects onto\nthe action- and social-related spatial representations, we adopted two classical measures taken\nas index of the extent, or“size”, of the PPS and the IPS, respectively. On the one hand, the\nreachability judgement task was here borrowed from the neuro-cognitive domain to measure\nthe PPS [7,25]. In this task, participants have to estimate whether stimuli presented at various\ndistances are reachable or not by extending their limb (without moving), thereby stressing the\nsensorimotor and potential action aspects of spatial perception. Since in this study we focused\non individual-to-individual relationships, we applied a modified version of the reachability\ntask, by asking participants to estimate the reachability distance towards an unfamiliar person.\nOn the other hand, the comfort-distance task, drawn from proxemics studies of social psychol-\nogy, was adopted to measure the IPS. In this task, participants have to stop the confederate at\nthe point where they still feel comfortable with the other’s proximity [15,26], stressing thus the\nsocial aspect of spatial perception. Importantly, participants performed the two tasks during\nboth Passive and Active approach conditions. In the former case, the confederate walked across\nthe room towards the participant, whereas in the latter case, the participant walked towards the\nconfederate. Given that PPS and IPS seem to share a similar size in the Active, but not in the\nPassive approach [19,20], we asked whether plastic effects of tool-use on spatial processing are\nmodulated by the active or passive way of interacting with the environment.\nExperiment 1\nMaterials and method\nEthics Statement. Participants gave written consent to take part in the study, which was\ncarried out in accordance with the 2008 Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethics Com-\nmittee of the University of Bologna.\nParticipants. Twenty-four participants (9 females, age range = 19– 27 years, mean\nage = 22 years), naive to the experimental hypothesis, volunteered for the study. Participants\nhad no self-reported history of neurological or psychiatric diseases, and were right-handed as\nassessed by administration of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [27]. We calculated our\ntarget sample size using an estimated effect size, f, of 0.2, which would require a sample of 24\nparticipants for the study to be powered at 80%. The a priori established sample size was also\nused as data-collection stopping rule, i.e. when 24 volunteers were administered with the tasks\nin a fully counterbalanced design, no more participant was recruited for this study.\nTool-Use Differently Shapes the Space around Our Body\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0154247 May 4, 2016 2/1 2\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nProcedure. All participants were tested in the same room (7.5 x 6.5 m) by one experi-\nmenter and two confederates. The experimental protocol consisted of two tasks (Reaching-\nand Comfort-distance,Fig 1A), designed to respectively measure the PPS and the IPS, that\nwere performed in both Passive and Active approach conditions. Testing began with a partici-\npant positioned at a fixed location in the room and one confederate standing at a distance of\nfour meters (starting position). In the Active conditions, participants approached a confederate\nand had to comply with either of two instructions:“stop yourself at the distance you think you\ncan reach the confederate” (Active Reaching-distance), or“stop yourself at the shortest dis-\ntance you feel comfortable with\" (Active Comfort-distance). In the Passive conditions, the con-\nfederate approached the participant who had to either:“stop the confederate at the distance\nyou think you can reach the confederate” (Passive Reaching-distance) or“stop the confederate\nat the shortest distance you feel comfortable with\" (Passive Comfort-distance). The distance\nbetween the participant and the confederate was recorded with a digital laser measurer (Agatec,\nmodel DM100, error ±.003 m), as the distance from the confederate’s to the participant’s\nsternum.\nThis procedure was repeated twice in separate blocks of five trials per each condition: before\nand after 15 minutes of tool-use. Two different male confederates, unknown to participants,\nwere involved in pre and post-tool sessions. One of the confederates approached and was\napproached by the participant for the entire duration of the first session before tool-use,\nwhereas the second confederate was introduced in the experimental session after tool-use.\nMoreover, to avoid any confounds due to aesthetical or idiosyncratic features of the two con-\nfederates, the order of the confederate facing the participant in the pre and post tool-use session\nwas also counterbalanced between participants. The confederates had to wear the same neutral\ncasual clothes and to maintain a neutral expression and same speed in walking throughout the\nexperimental session. Confederates’ gaze was kept looking straight ahead at participants’ eye-\nlevel. Before starting the experiment all participants received an explanation of the task and\nhad four practice trials with the experimenter. Then the first confederate was introduced.\nDuring tool-use, participants stood still in front of a table and were required to use a 70 cm-\nlong rake to reach and to retrieve, one at a time, a total of 36 tokens, located out of the reaching\nspace, at a distance of/C2585 cm from the participants’ sternum. Tokens were randomly posi-\ntioned by the experimenter at different azimuthal and radial locations in order to cover the\nwhole participant's action space. Participants were instructed to make a continuous, fluid\nmovement to retrieve the targets and to move them close to their body midline. There was no\ntime constraint and participants were required to be as accurate as possible.\nImmediately after 15 minutes of tool-use, participants were asked to perform the two tasks\n(Comfort-distance and Reaching-distance) in both the Active and Passive approach condi-\ntions. Throughout the experimental sessions before and after too-use, the participants stood\nwith their arms extended along their trunk and were instructed to close their eyes between each\ntrial. The order of the tasks was counterbalanced between subjects.\nData analysis\nTo test whether tool-use may‘extend’ either the Reaching-distance or the Comfort-distance\nmeasures or both, the mean distances obtained in the different experimental conditions were\ncompared through a three-way ANOVA with Session (Pre-Post tool-use), Task (Reaching-\nComfort distance), and Approach (Passive-Active approach) as within-participant factors.\nNewman-Keuls post-hoc test was used to analyse significant effects. Partial eta squared (η\n2\np)\nand Cohen’s d were used to report effect size. Additional variables included as covariates in\nexploratory analyses were age, sex, handedness and years of formal education.

More interestingly, the significant Task x Session interaction\n(F1,23 =6.25, p = .020,η2\np = 0.21) showed that the Reaching-distance (p = .018), but not the\nComfort-distance (p = .333), was significantly extended after tool-use as compared to before.\nThe Reaching-distance before tool-use was the shortest distance as compared to all other con-\nditions (all ps/C20.018). The ANOVA also found a statistically significant interaction between\nApproach and Task variables (F\n1,23 = 16.08, p< .001, η2\np = 0.41). In the Passive approach, the\nComfort-distance was larger than the Reaching-distance (p< .001), whereas in the Active\napproach, Comfort and Reaching distances did not significantly differ (p = .797). The Passive-\nComfort condition was significantly larger as compared to all other conditions (all ps< .001).\nSignificant main effects and interactions are reported inTable 1.\nSince the three-way interaction was not significant (F1,23< 1, p = .635,η2\np = 0.01), the effect\nof tool-use in the Reaching-distance task was present both in the Active (two tailedt(23) =\n3.35, p = .002, d = 0.71) and in the Passive condition (two tailedt(23) = 4.12, p< .001,\nd = 0.83), but was not evident in the Comfort-distance task for either approach (p/C21.475, Fig\n1B). Furthermore, in line with previous studies, at baseline in the Active approach no signifi-\ncant difference between Comfort and Reaching-distance appeared (two tailedt(23) < 1, p =\n.388, d = 0.18). Overall, these results reveal that tool-use modifies the reaching space, but not\nthe comfort space.\nDiscussion\nThe issue addressed in this study is whether the PPS and the IPS underlie two different func-\ntional representations of the space that closely surrounds our body. We therefore investigated\nchanges of PPS and IPS after tool-use by measuring the spatial distance between the participant\nand another person in a Reaching- and a Comfort-distance task. Two main results emerged\nfrom the first experiment: first, we replicated previous findings, indicating PPS and IPS seem to\nrefer in some circumstances to a similarly sized sector of space. Indeed, Reaching- and Com-\nfort-distances had a similar extent when participants walked toward stimuli (Active approach).\nBy contrast, the Comfort-distance was larger than the Reaching-distance when participants\nTable 1.

Second, more inter-\nestingly, the result of the first experiment goes beyond previous findings by revealing that the\ntool-use manipulation was effective in shaping selectively the perceived reaching space (PPS),\nboth during the Active and the Passive approaches, but not the perceived comfort space (IPS).\nWhen considering this dissociation, it is worth noticing that during tool-use session the\nrake allowed participants to reach targets located beyond the natural reaching distance of their\nhand, and thereby, the rake significantly extended their action space. In line with previous\nworks on tool-use [12– 14,22], it is thus likely that an extension of the sensorimotor representa-\ntion of the arm length was critical to determine such an extension of action space. However, a\npossible alternative interpretation may be that the mere act of reaching repetitively for objects\nplaced in the space in front of the participant, regardless of the length of the used tool, may\nhave affected the estimated reaching distance. In order to control for this potential alternative\nexplanation, we conducted another study (Experiment 2), where as a control, participants used\na short rake that did not offer effective extension of their arm length [14,21,23,25]. In Experi-\nment 2, we anticipated that only using a tool that elongates the arm length would modulate the\nPPS, as measured by the Reaching-distance task, whereas using a short tool should be\nineffective.\nConcerning the lack of a significant effect of tool-use on the comfort space estimation, one\ncould argue that participants may have used non-spatial (e.g., temporal) strategies, since the\ntwo confederates were positioned at a constant distance from the participant prior to and fol-\nlowing tool-use session. Thus, to avoid this potential confound in Experiment 2 confederates\nwere positioned at one of three different initial distances from participants.\nExperiment 2\nBy analogy with previous work estimating reachable distance from objects [25], Experiment 2\ntested the hypothesis that tools that increase the natural range of action, as compared to those\nwhich do not, may“extend” the reachable space estimate toward another individual. To this\naim, participants performed the same tasks as in the previous experiment, but they wielded\neither a long or a short tool. Since in Experiment 1 the tool-use effect was observed in both Pas-\nsive and Active approaches, and the Reaching- and Comfort-distances were similar only in the\nActive one, in Experiment 2 we focused on the Active approach. Furthermore, the confederate\nwas randomly located at three different positions, thus preventing participants from using a\nnon-spatial strategy to stop themselves in front of the confederate. We predicted an increased\ndistance in the estimated reaching space after use of the long, but not the short tool. Finally, we\nshould expect no change in the estimated comfort space after either long or short tool session,\neven after preventing the use of non-spatial strategies.\nMaterials and method\nEthics Statement. All participants volunteered and provided written informed consent.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Bologna and was per-\nformed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.\nParticipants. Forty-eight healthy volunteers (24 females, age range = 18– 27, mean\nage = 22.47 years) naive to the purpose of the study participated in this experiment. None of\nthese participants took part in the previous experiment. All participants had normal or cor-\nrected-to-normal vision, no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases, and all but two were\nright-handed, as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [27].\nProcedure. The experimental setting and procedure were similar to those of Experiment\n1, with the following exceptions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:\nTool-Use Differently Shapes the Space around Our Body\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0154247 May 4, 2016 6/1 2\nLong tool group or Short tool group. In the former group, the rake was the same as in the previ-\nous experiment (70 cm-long). In the latter group, the tool was a 10 cm-long weight-matched\nrake. The distance at which target objects were placed during the short tool-use session was\nadapted at around/C2525 cm from the participant’s body. Participants performed the Reaching-\nand Comfort-distance tasks in separate blocks, under Active approach only, prior to and fol-\nlowing the tool-use session. As in Experiment 1, each participant faced a different confederate\nbefore and after the tool-use sessions. In each condition the position of the confederate, and\nthereby the initial distance from participant, could be either 3.5 m, 4 m, or 4.5 m from the par-\nticipant. Each different confederate position was randomly administrated four times, yielding a\ntotal of twelve trials per each condition.\nData analysis\nStatistical analyses consisted on a three-way ANOVA taking the variables Session (Pre-Post\ntool-use) and Task (Reaching-Comfort distance) as within-participant factors and the variable\nTool group (Short-Long tool group) as between-participant factors. Partial eta squared and\nCohen’s d are used to report effect size. Significant sources of variance were explored by New-\nman– Keuls post-hoc tests. In addition, because preliminary analyses of variance failed to reveal\nany significant effect of the different confederate positions (i.e., neither main effect of Confed-\nerate distance nor any interaction with the other terms reached statistical significance, allFs/C21\n1.19, allps/C21.313), this factor is not considered further here.\nResults\nThe ANOVA revealed a significant Task x Session interaction (F1,46 = 6.64, p = .013,η2\np =\n0.13), explained by the fact that the pre-tool Reaching-distance showed the shortest amplitudes\nas compared to the post-tool Reaching-distance (p = .024) and to the Comfort distance before\n(p = .012) as well as after tool-use (p = .024). Crucial to the present investigation, a significant\nTask x Session x Tool group interaction emerged (F\n1,46 = 7.25, p = .010,η2\np = 0.14). Post hoc\ntests revealed that the interaction was driven by an increased Reaching-distance estimation in\nthe Long tool group following the use of long tool with respect to before (p = .001), whilst no\nsignificant difference between before and after long tool-use amplitudes was found in the Com-\nfort-distance task (p = .839). On the other hand, in the Short tool group post hoc tests showed\nno significant differences prior to vs. following the use of short tool in either the Reaching- (p\n= .836) or the Comfort-distance task (p = .652,Fig 2). In addition, none of the other terms in\nthe ANOVA reached statistical significance (allFs /C212.62). In sum, the critical statistical inter-\naction Task x Session x Tool group witnesses that only the use of a long, but not a short tool\naffected the reachable space estimation. In sharp contrast, neither the use of a short nor of a\nlong tool modulated the comfort space estimation.\nDiscussion\nExperiment 2 replicates previous findings in showing the tool-use-dependent plasticity of PPS\n(e.g., [13,24]). In particular, only after using the 70 cm-long tool that extends the arm reachable\nspace the PPS was extended, as measured by the Reaching-distance task. As predicted, and also\nin line with previous studies (e.g., [14,25]), using a shorter tool that provides no functional\nextension to the arm did not influence the PPS. As far as the question of whether the IPS repre-\nsentation may be plastically shaped by the use of tools, the second experiment confirms the\nlack of effect of tool-use on the Comfort-distance task.\nTool-Use Differently Shapes the Space around Our Body\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0154247 May 4, 2016 7/1 2\nGeneral Discussion\nThis study brings two major new findings. As first important result, tool-use can modify the\nreachability estimate toward another person, a potentially relevant social stimulus. At odds\nwith previous tool-use studies, by focusing on individual-to-individual spatial relationships,\ni.e., the interpersonal distance [28], we provide here, to the best of our knowledge, the first\ndemonstration that tool-use affects the estimated reaching-distance between two conspecifics.\nSo far, previous research has demonstrated that the extent of PPS representation is dynami-\ncally shaped by use of tools that increase the arm length [12,23,24,29,30], as using short tool,\nwhich does not extend action potentiality, is not sufficient to“elongate” the PPS [14,21,25,31].\nNoteworthy, most if not all studies on PPS have so far tested participants while facing objects\nin absence of conspecifics, although people around us often represent the most behaviorally\nrelevant stimuli in everyday life. In this respect, the findings from the present work indicate\nthat extending the arm action capability also affects the perceived reaching distance from\nanother individual.\nThe second and most important result is that tool-use modulates the PPS, as measured by\nthe Reaching-distance task, but not the social IPS, as measured by the Comfort-distance task.\nThis dissociation is particularly interesting as the estimated reaching and comfort space had\nsimilar size before tool-use, specifically in the Active approach, that is when participants\nmoved toward the confederate (for similar findings see also [20]). In light of such a similarity,\nit might appear surprising that tool-use does not influence the social space surrounding the\nbody, but only the space representation for action. Before considering the theoretical implica-\ntions of this finding, consistently observed across two experiments, we wish to emphasize that\nour design was aimed at controlling for potentially confounding variables, such as stimulus\nfamiliarity and non-spatial response biases, that could account for the lack of effect of tool use\non the social space representation. Several pieces of evidence from social psychological studies\nindicate that repeated contact and familiarity with individuals affect interpersonal distances\n(e.g., [32,33]). In order to avoid this possible confound, here participants were not exposed to\nthe same person in the session prior to and following tool-use: confederates’ identity differed\nbetween pre- and post-tool use sessions. In addition, since in the second experiment the con-\nfederate was not located at the same initial distance from the participant, it is unlikely that the\nFig 2.

Asterisk indicates a significant difference\nbetween Reaching-distance before (PRE, dark grey) and after (POST, light grey) long tool-use session.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0154247.g002\nTool-Use Differently Shapes the Space around Our Body\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0154247 May 4, 2016 8/1 2\ninternally replicated finding concerning the Comfort-distance task may be due to any\nresponse/strategy bias. In Experiment 2, indeed, participants could not use non-spatial cues,\nsuch as the time spent while walking or the number of walking steps.\nThus, the results of both experiments converge in indicating that social and action space\nrepresentations do not fully share the same functional properties. Moreover, but fundamental\nto the present study, this tool-use dependent dissociation actually fits well some anatomo-func-\ntional differences between PPS and IPS. In this regard, to identify specific areas associated with\nIPS a previous study [34] focused on which brain regions respond to interpersonal space intru-\nsion by social stimuli (i.e., conspecifics) versus non-social stimuli (i.e., objects). To this end,\nHolt and colleagues used both an out-of-scanner behavioral task, similar to that we used here\ninvolving actual intrusion of space by a conspecific, and a within-scanner virtual task designed\nto simulate interpersonal space intrusion through the apparent approach or withdrawal of a\nconspecific’s face vs. the same approaching/receding movement of inanimate objects. They\nreported the dorsal intraparietal sulcus and ventral premotor cortex to be more sensitive to\napproaching than to receding faces. Contrary to what one could expect if the same neuronal\npopulations would code for IPS and PPS, this differential activity did not emerge when con-\ntrasting approaching versus receding objects (i.e., non-social objects that are typically effective\nstimuli for eliciting PPS neuron responses in the monkey and humans). Additionally, the\nauthors demonstrated that the strength of the functional connectivity between these parietal-\nfrontal regions was negatively correlated with participants’ interpersonal distance, measured\nbehaviorally outside of the scanner. These results suggest a link between areas responding to\nvirtual approaching faces in the scanner and individual preferences in interpersonal distance.\nOn the other hand, specific areas associated with PPS have been identified by electrophysiolog-\nical approaches in primates, which have well-established that neuronal populations coding for\nvisual stimuli near the body are located in interconnected regions involving the inferior parietal\nlobe, intraparietal sulcus, premotor cortex, and putamen [35,36,2]. Similarly, evidence from\nhumans indicates a representation of PPS in the putative homologous parietal and frontal\nregions [37– 39]. Indeed fMRI adaptation studies, allowing to isolate functionally selective neu-\nronal populations, demonstrated that some neuronal populations within the premotor and\nparietal cortices (inferior parietal lobe and anterior intraparietal sulcus), as well as the putamen\nare involved in the coding for approaching, non-socially relevant objects [39– 41]. Taken\ntogether, these findings suggest that, when considering the social vs. non-social nature of\nnearby stimuli, the PPS and IPS representations seem not completely overlapping also at the\nneural level.\nTo summarise, researchers from cognitive psychology, neuroscience and social psychology\nhave recently looked with great interest at the possibility that the same underlying processes\nmediate interactions with both inanimate and animate objects within the space surrounding\nour body [26]. Although some previous studies have highlighted a communality between peri-\nand inter-personal spatial representations, here we disclose a functional dissociation between\nthe two sectors of the space at the behavioural level. Whilst it has been shown that PPS plastic-\nity may be sensitive to top-down influences coming from social experiences with the individual\nfacing us [17– 20], here we report that the sensorimotor plasticity induced by tool-use on the\naction space does not influence the social space between individuals. Critically, this finding was\nobserved while concurrently demonstrating that the very same tool-use manipulation was\neffective in extending the PPS also when measured from a more social perspective, namely by\nasking to estimate the reachable distance with respect to a person, instead of an object. There-\nfore, the results reported here provide novel insights to the current debate, spanning from cog-\nnitive neuroscience to social psychology [9,20,28,34,39,42], about some critical functional\nfeatures of action and social space representations, notably their plasticity.\nTool-Use Differently Shapes the Space around Our Body\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0154247 May 4, 2016 9/1 2\nWe propose that, to devise appropriate models of PPS and IPS, one should bear in mind\nthat, at least in the present experimental conditions, there is no complete functional overlap\nbetween these sectors of space. We believe that a single example of functional dissociation is\nindeed sufficient to warn scholars to refrain from risky conflations between the two concepts,\nand critically inform current theoretical models about space perception. After all, even if we\ncould use one single space representation as frame-of-reference for interacting with other\nobjects and people, it would make sense that the spatial representations that we use flexibly\nconform to the task at hand.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Rita Spedicati and Mariano D’Angelo for their help in collecting data, and two anon-\nymous reviewers for their useful comments on an early version of the paper.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: IP AF FF.
