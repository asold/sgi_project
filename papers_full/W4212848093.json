An essential task that goes hand in hand with\nthis, is evaluating the current condition of electrical\nequipment is. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is an ac-\ncepted procedure worldwide for condition assessment\nand condition monitoring of transformers. In addi-\ntion, DGA is the most frequently used procedure to\ndetect incipient faults at an early stage and one that\nalso has the capability to initiate appropriate mainte-\nnance measures [ 1, 2].\nNaphthenic mineral oil consists primarily of a mix-\nture of hydrocarbon chains (C 12H26, 11.6%) and alka-\nnes—A cycloalkane (C 14H28, 15.5%), bicyclic alkanes\n(C13H24, 28.5%), tricyclic alkanes (C 16H28, 23.3%) and\ntetracyclic alkanes (C 16H26,9 . 7 % )( F i g .1;[ 3]). Electrical\nand/or thermal stresses in the transformer can exceed\nthe binding energy of the carbon-carbon or carbon-\nhydrogen bonds. The bonds break and the resulting\ninstable decomposition pro ducts then combine again\nCH3\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH3\nC12H26 C14H28\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH3\nC13H24\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH CH3\nC16H28\nCH\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH3\nC16H26\nCH2\nCHC H\nCH2 CH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH2\nCH2\nCH\nCH\nCH2CH2\nCH2\nFig. 1 Molecular structures of main components of naphthenic mineral oil, following [3]\nFig. 2 Transformer with\nonline DGA system\nto form gaseous molecules, which can be present in\ndissolved and/or free form. The resulting key gases\nare H 2,C H 4,C 2H2,C 2H4 and C 2H6. In addition, CO\nand CO 2, which are produced in combination with at-\nmospheric oxygen and cellu lose degradation, as well\nas O 2 are also among the key gases [ 4, 5].\nWith DGA, the presence or concertation of the key\ngases is detected within the mineral. There is the\npossibility of manual sampling including subsequent\nanalysis in the laboratory and the possibility of con-\ntinuous monitoring systems (online DGA, Fig. 2). In\ngeneral, the measurement starts with sampling and\nextraction of the gases dissolved in the oil. A distinc-\ntion is made between the different extraction meth-\nods, with vacuum extraction being the most accurate\nand the headspace metho d the most commonly used.\nIn the headspace method, a gas phase consisting of\ncarrier gas is located above the mineral oil to be anal-\nysed, into which the dissolved gases diffuse. After the\nextraction of the gases, their composition is analysed.\nIn most cases, this is done us ing gas chromatography.\nHere, the gas mixture (carrier gas + key gases) is forced\nthrough a system of tubes and detected on a ther-\nmal detector. The gas molecules migrate through the\ncolumns of the GC tube at different speeds and then\nhit the detector at a deﬁned point in time, depending\non the physical and chemical properties. Other meth-\nods with their own speciﬁc advantages and disadvan-\ntages are also in use, such as infrared spectroscopy. In\nthis method, the reﬂection of an infrared light source\nK Online dissolved gas analysis used for transformers – possibilities, experiences, and limitations 89\nOriginalarbeit\nis analysed depending on the gases present. Different\ngas molecules absorb different frequencies of the IR\nspectrum to different degrees. The great advantage of\nthis method is very high long-term stability and the\nmaintenance-free nature of the device itself, but not\nall key gases can be directly detected with this method\n[6, 7].\n2 Condition assessment of transformers by DGA\nIt is possible to determine the present condition of the\ntransformer by analysing the gases dissolved in the oil.\nThere are various approaches for data interpretation\n[8]. One frequently used method is to compare iden-\ntically designed transformers and deﬁne a threshold\nvalue at 90% of the maximum gas concentrations. It\nis assumed, that the probability of a fault occurring in\na transformer at gas concentrations below this thresh-\nold is low. If one of these gas thresholds is exceeded,\nthe transformer should be inspected more precisely .\nIf the ﬂeet of transformers is too small or no com-\nparative data is available, reference values from the\nliterature and standards can be used. Trends of recent\nyears have shown that a condition assessment based\non absolute gas concentrations can often be insufﬁ-\ncient, the rates of gas change are thus increasingly\nused as an assessment criterion. Here, also, the 90%\nvalue of the gas change rate is deﬁned or reference val-\nues can be used [ 4, 9, 10]. The procedure deﬁned in\nIEEE C57.104 goes one step further and makes recom-\nmendations for action direc tly on the individual gas\nconcentrations and gas change rates (Table 1;[ 11]).\nDepending on the real instantaneous energy input,\ntypical key gas compositions are formed for differ-\nent faults (Fig. 3a). A distinction is made between\ncatalytic reactions R, partial discharges of the corona\ntype PD, stray gassing S, thermal faults T1 (< 300 °C),\nTable 1 Recommendations for action related to percent-\nage of total combustible gases (TCG) [11]\nTCG\n(%)\nTCG rate\n(%/day)\nSampling\nInterval\nOperating Procedures\n> 0.3 Daily\n0.01–0.3 Daily\nConsider removal from service;\nAdvise manufacturer\nCondition 4 ≥5\n< 0.01 Weekly Exercise extreme caution;\nAnalyse for individual gases;\nPlan outage;\nAdvise Manufacturer\n> 0.3 Weekly\n0.01–0.3 Weekly\nCondition 3 2–5\n< 0.01 Monthly\nExercise extreme caution;\nAnalyse for individual gases;\nPlan outage;\nAdvise manufacturer\n> 0.3 Monthly\n0.01–0.3 Monthly\nCondition 2 0.5–2\n< 0.01 Quarterly\nExercise caution;\nAnalyse for individual gases;\nDetermine load dependence\n> 0.3 Monthly Exercise caution;\nAnalyse for individual gases;\nDetermine load dependence\n0.01–0.3 Quarterly\nCondition 1 < 0.5\n< 0.01 Annual\nContinue normal operation\nT2 (300 °C–700 °C) and T3 (> 700 °C), overheated paper\nor cellulose O, carbonisat ion of cellulose C, low en-\nergy discharge D1 and high energy discharges D2 [ 11,\n12]. Various mathematical and graphical methods are\navailable for fault identiﬁcation, which are described\nin detail in [ 6, 10]. The most frequently used meth-\nods are the key gas method, the gas concentration\nratio method according to Rogers/Doernenburg/IEC\nand the Duval triangle method (Fig. 3b; [ 2, 6, 13]).\n3 Beneﬁts of an online DGA monitoring system\nIn recent years proof has been provided that knowing\nthe history of a transformer and detecting incipi-\nent faults from an early stage is a great advantage.\nThrough continuous monitoring, the condition of\na transformer can be determined more accurately\nand maintenance measures can be more effectively\nplanned (Fig. 4). This leads to better allocation of\navailable monetary and material resources and an in-\ncrease in overall system reliability [ 1, 14]. An essential\npart of this is to know exactly the rates of change of\ndissolved gases in a transformer—they are considered\na more important indicator than the absolute gas con-\ncentrations [ 9]. The assessment of the transformer\ncondition based on absolute gas concentrations can\nlead to incorrect estimates. The same amount of dis-\nsolved gas can be assessed with a different criticality\nin different transformers [ 4, 13, 14]. Furthermore,\ngas concentrations in different transformers can be\nattributed to different causes. There are transformers\nwith highly increased gas concentrations that have\nbeen operating stably for many years and show no or\nonly very small further increases. This might indicate\nan inactive fault, which can lead to a failure within\na short time if it begins to evolve again. It is advisable\nto aim for continuous monitoring of the transformer.\nOther transformers show very rapid increases in dis-\nsolved gases in a very short time, which cannot be\ndetected in time by regular sampling [ 9].\nThe fact that the condition of a transformer can\nchange rapidly is shown by the case of a 23.5/432 kV\ngenerator step-up transformer, where a multi-gas\nDGA monitoring system was installed in 2010. Up\nto that time, the transformer did not show any sig-\nniﬁcant gas concentrations. Shortly after installation,\nthere was a sharp increase in H\n2 and C 2H2, indicating\nan electrical fault (Fig. 5). For safety reasons, the\ntransformer was taken off the grid, subjected to elec-\ntrical tests and maintenance work. The electrical tests\ndid not lead to a result, but forensic examinations\nshowed a developing electrical fault in the winding\nwith an already advanced decomposition of the pa-\nper insulation (degree of polymerisation, DP < 200)\n[13]. The DP value corresponds to the number of\ninterconnected glucose rings of the cellulose. It pro-\nvides information about the current condition of the\npaper insulation and has a direct correlation to the\nremaining service life. The number of interconnected\n90 Online dissolved gas analysis used for transformers – possibilities, experiences, and limitations K\nOriginalarbeit\nFig. 3 Distribution of key gases for different faults in percentage (a) and Duval triangle one (b)\nFig. 4 380/110-kV trans-\nformer with a DGA monitor-\ning system (a)a n dt h eD G A\nmonitor itself (b)\nFig. 5 Time dependent dissolved gas concentrations in\na 23.5/432kV GSU transformer, based on [13]\nFig. 6 Time dependent dissolved gas concentrations in\na 345kV GSU transformer, based on [12]\nK Online dissolved gas analysis used for transformers – possibilities, experiences, and limitations 91\nOriginalarbeit\nglucose rings in new transformers is in the range of\n1000 to 1200. When this value is less than 200, it\ncan be assumed that the paper quality is no longer\nsufﬁcient for reliable operation [ 8].\nIn [ 14], ﬁve cases are described in which a DGA\nmonitoring system was able to successfully identify\nincipient faults at an early state. Of particular interest\nis the case of a 735/230 kV transformer where a fault\nin the bushing area was detected in time by an in-\ncrease in H 2. Consequently, the transformer load was\nreduced and the transformer could be taken off the\ngrid and maintained within 40 days as planned. The\nestimated cost saving due to the early detection of the\nfault and the corresponding repair of the transformer\nis estimated to be around $ 4,000,000.\nA somewhat more recent example from [ 12]a l s o\nshows that gas concentrations can increase rapidly\nwithin a short time (Fig. 6). The evaluation of the\ndata with all methods showed that there is a thermal\nfault and the scenario described in [ 11]r e q u e s t si m -\nmediate action. The integra ted Buchholz relay did not\ntrigger in this case and the transformer was manually\ntaken off the grid. The inspection carried out showed\nsevere carbonisation of the paper insulation.\nIn general, any incipient fault is accompanied by\nthe formation of hydrogen (compare Fig. 3a). In many\ncases, a hydrogen sensor is sufﬁcient for monitoring\nand enables a simple realisation of a monitoring sys-\ntem. The interpretation basis for a developing defect\nand also its classiﬁcation is strongly limited, however,\nsince historical data is only available for H 2 or a few\nother gases. Hydrogen is not always available in sufﬁ-\ncient quantities for thermal defects such as those that\noccur with broken or loose c onnections, overheating\ncores, poor cooling, eddy currents, etc. The so-called\n“hot metal gases” (CH 4,C 2H6 and C 2H4)a r eo fc e n -\ntral importance here. Furthermore, the increase of\nC2H2 as a signiﬁcant sign for electrical discharges is\nnot present. C 2H2 can indicate a signiﬁcant fault from\nconcentrations of a few ppm. In the case of stray\ngassing, there is also a large increase in H 2, although\nthis is not a defect wi th consequences [ 12]. It can thus\nbe stated that monitoring with an H 2 sensor is better\nthan no monitoring at all, but each additional key gas\nincreases the overall system reliability and prevents\ncostly failures. The recognised disadvantage of multi-\ngas monitoring systems is the purchase price, but this\nis negligible compared to the cost of a power trans-\nformer failure.\n4 Gas balance of transformers for DGA\ninterpretation\n4.1 Degassing at the phase interface\nIn the case of free-breathing transformers, which\nare primarily used in Europe, gas exchange occurs\nat the phase interface between the mineral oil and\nthe gas phase above [ 15, 16]. This exchange can be\nFig. 7 Time dependent gas generation in a hermetically\nsealed and a free breathing arangement [17]\nexplained by the desired equal distribution of free\nmoving molecules in a closed chemical-physical sys-\ntem. After the appearance of an electrical or thermal\nfault, very high gas concentrations are formed locally\nat the point of the fault due to the decomposition\nof the mineral oil and possibly of the cellulose. Sub-\nsequently, the dissolved and free gas molecules are\ndistributed throughout the entire system. This bal-\nancing process is composed of free diffusion and\nsuperimposed convection ﬂows. Consequently, an\nequilibrium is established between the gas phase and\nthe mineral oil, which means that key gases are de-\ngassed into the gas phase and gases from the gas\nphase dissolve in the mineral oil [ 2, 15, 17].\nAlthough this method is not generally recom-\nmended today, the condition of a transformer, as\nwell as its warning and alarm gas values, are deter-\nmined using the absolute gas concentrations [ 9, 11].\nDue to the continuous degassing with simultaneous\ngas formation, a state of equ ilibrium is established\nbetween these two processes. This equilibrium does\nnot necessarily reﬂect the actual state of the trans-\nformer [ 15, 18, 19]. Fig. 7 shows the concentrations\nof dissolved gases in the case of a continuous surface\nd i s c h a r g eo v e rt i m ei nal a b o r a t o r ye x p e r i m e n t . I t\ncan be seen that in the free-breathing conﬁguration,\nan equilibrium between degassing and gas formation\nalready occurs, whereas this does not occur in the\nhermetically sealed conﬁguration. Furthermore, the\ndegassing of H 2 and CH 4 takes place so quickly that\nno measurable concentrations arise in the test object.\nThis may also lead to a different interpretation of the\ndefect [ 17].\n4.2 Dissolving air gases and their temperature\nbehaviour\nT h eo p p o s i t ec a s et ot h ed e g a s s i n go ft r a n s f o r m e r s\nis the dissolving of ambient air gases from the atmo-\nspheric ambient air during initial commissioning or\nafter degassing of the mineral oil [ 16]. Own measure-\nments showed a saturation concentration of about\n92 Online dissolved gas analysis used for transformers – possibilities, experiences, and limitations K\nOriginalarbeit\nFig. 8 Dissolving of N2,O 2 and CO2 fromambient air in min-\neral oil of a 200l transformer model in the laboratory (a)a n d\ntemperature and concentration of dissolved CO2 over time of\na in service 110/380kV transformer (b)\n63,000 ppm for N 2, 18,000 ppm for O 2 and 500 ppm for\nCO2 (Fig. 8a). It can also be seen that different gases\ndissolve in the mineral oil with different velocities.\nIn addition, different concentrations of dissolved\ngases can occur depending on temperature ﬂuctua-\ntions due to changes in the load or the ambient tem-\nperature. On the one hand, this is due to the tempera-\nture dependence of Henry’ s constant, which describes\nthe gas solubility in mineral oil, and the gas storage\ncapacity of cellulose. Fig. 8b shows this behaviour\nbased on measurements at a 110/380 kV transformer.\nFig. 9 Setup for measur-\ning Henry constants\nThe concentration of CO 2 is stated in p. u. with ref-\nerence to the maximum value of the concentration in\nthe period under consideration.\n5 Current research on chemical and physical\nproperties for DGA interpretation\n5.1 General\nAs mentioned above, gas exchange occurs in the area\nof the phase interface. Dissolved gas molecules in\nthe mineral oil diffuse into the gas phase and gas\nmolecules from the air or the gas cushion dissolves\nin the mineral oil. Since different substances have\nvarying solubilities, different gases degas at unequal\nrates. This leads to a shift in the relative proportions\nof the gases and makes it difﬁcult to identify the fault\nby established methods like the ratio methods or Du-\nval triangles [ 17].\nFor decades, the DGA has been a well-suited and\napproved method for assessing and monitoring the\ncondition of transformers. By taking the gas exchange\ninto account, the DGA could be further improved. An\neven more precise assessment of the current condition\nwould be possible and the accuracy of interpretation\nwould be increased. For this purpose, a mathematical\nmodel based on the various mass transport theories\nis being developed and tested at the Institute of High\nVoltage Engineering and System Performance. In fu-\nture, this model should be able to quantify the de-\ngassing at the phase interface between the mineral oil\nand the overlying gas blanket or the ambient air [ 18].\nIn general, all transfer and transport processes are\nsubject to comparable physical laws and are described\nby similar effects. The mass transfer is understood\nto be a change in quantity in a time interval. The\ndiffusion coefﬁcients and the Henry constants are\nconsidered to be the determining parameters for\nthe characteristics of mass transfer. The diffusion\ncoefﬁcients determine the relationship between con-\ncentration gradient and diffusive mass transfer. The\nHenry constants describe the concentration equilib-\nK Online dissolved gas analysis used for transformers – possibilities, experiences, and limitations 93\nOriginalarbeit\nrium between the liquid and gaseous phase at the\nphase interface [ 18, 20].\nThe Henry constants of gas i are based on own in-\nvestigations and are determined experimentally as de-\nscribed in [ 21]. The schematic test setup is shown in\nFig. 9. The oil samples taken after saturation are anal-\nysed in the laboratory for the corresponding concen-\ntration ci.T h e n , ci is set in relation to the measured gas\npressure pi and the Henry constant Hi results (Eq. 1).\nHi = pi\nci\nin Pa/ppm (1)\nThe diffusion coefﬁcient D describes the relation-\nship between a concentration gradient and the dif-\nfusion ﬂux. An exact determination is only possible\nempirically—e.g. measurement with a diaphragm dif-\nfusion cell. In practice, mathematical approximations\nare often used, but these can be of very variable qual-\nity. The values of the diffusion coefﬁcients increase\nwith rising temperature and pressure [ 20, 22]. The\nmost commonly used approaches are the Stokes-Ein-\ns t e i ne q u a t i o n( E q .2, k Boltzmann constant, T tem-\nperature, η dynamic viscosity of the solvent, R0 Van-\nder-Waals radius) and the approach of Wilke and\nChang (Eq. 3, φassociation factor of the solvent, Mm,2\nmolecular mass of the solvent, Vm,1 molar volume\nof the diffusing species at the boiling point under\nnormal conditions, η2 to the viscosity of the liquid,\nT temperature) [ 20, 23–25].\nD = kT\n6π·η·R0\n(2)\nD =7,4 ·10−8\n⎛\n⎝(\nϕ·Mm,2\n)1/2 · T\nη2 ·V 0,6\nm,2,S\n⎞\n⎠ (3)\nAnother empirical approach is provided by the\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API), which is specif-\nically designed to determin e diffusion coefﬁcients of\ndissolved gases in petroleum liquids (Eq. 4, D1,2 in\nft2/h, T in °Ra, η2 cP ,R in Å) [ 26].\nD =5,922 ·10−8 · T ·R2\nη2 ·R 2/3\n1\n(4)\n5.2 Results and interpretation\n5.2.1 Henry constants\nThe experiments carried out clearly show that various\ngases behave differently with increasing temperature.\nThe solubility of the investigated hydrocarbons (C 2H2,\nC2H4,C 2H6 and CH 4) increases with rising tempera-\nture, whereas the solubility of hydrogen (H 2) decreases\nwith increasing temperature (Fig. 10). This behaviour\nis also consistent with the available results [ 19, 27–30].\nIt should be noted that the Ostwald coefﬁcients have\nan opposite behaviour since the Ostwald coefﬁcients\nroughly correspond to the reciprocal of the respective\nHenry’s constants [21].\nFig. 10 Henry constant of different gases over temperature\nAn actual comparison of the measured and calcu-\nlated Ostwald coefﬁcients w ith values from the liter-\nature is only possible to a limited extent, as there is\nno indication of the exact deﬁnition of the Ostwald\ncoefﬁcients used [ 4, 11]. However, the chosen deﬁ-\nnition variant has a strong inﬂuence on the expected\nvalue [ 29]. Furthermore, the values in [ 4, 11] reﬂect\naveraged values and the density of the oil used has\na signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the actual values of the co-\nefﬁcients and constants [ 30]. A more detailed look\nat the values in Table 2 shows that the differences to\nthe values in the literature are relatively large but the\nvalues are in the same order of magnitude. The con-\nversion between the Henry constants and Ostwald co-\nefﬁcients was carried out according to [ 30].\n5.2.2 Diffusion coefficients\nA deeper look at the calculation results of the diffusion\ncoefﬁcients for different key gases (C 2H2,C 2H4,C 2H6,\nH2 and CH 4) shows that they not only increase with\nrising temperature but that there are also signiﬁcant\ndifferences between the individual gases and calcula-\ntion procedures (Fig. 11).\nThe non-linear increase with temperature results\nfrom the fact that not only is the temperature directly\nlinear (cf. Eqs. 2 to 4) but other parameters such as\nviscosity, radii and volumes are also temperature-de-\npendent.\nIn the Wilke and Chang method, the value of the\nboiling point has the greatest inﬂuence on the slope of\nthe curve, as this has a decisive inﬂuence on the molar\nTable 2 Comparison of own measurements with values\nfrom literature at 25°C\nHenry Constants Ostwald Coefﬁcients\nMeasurements Calculations [4] [11]\nPa/ppm\nH2 2.746 (± 0.089) 0.079 (± 0.003) 0.056 0.043\nCH4 0.437 (± 0.065) 2.563 (± 0.351) 0.429 0.337\nC2H2 0.155 (± 0.021) 7.244 (± 0.898) 1.240 0.937\nC2H4 0.135 (± 0.036) 7.781 (± 2.092) 1.840 1.350\nC2H6 0.112 (± 0.009) 9.944 (± 0.817) 2.820 1.990\n94 Online dissolved gas analysis used for transformers – possibilities, experiences, and limitations K\nOriginalarbeit\nFig. 11 Temperature dependent diffusion coefficients of hy-\ndrogen,determinedwiththehelpo fdifferentcalculationmeth-\nods\nvolume. In the literature, the results determined for\nthe diffusion coefﬁcients vary in the range of 10 –8 m2/s\nand 10 –11 m2/s. The values determined using the ap-\nproximation formula are within this range (Table 3).\nFor the ﬁrst calculations, the determined values can\nbe used, but for a more precise later consideration,\nmeasurements of the diffusion coefﬁcients should be\ncarried out [ 31–33].\n6 Summary\nThe optimal utilisation of resources and thus also the\ncondition assessment of electrical equipment in the\npower engineering sector is becoming increasingly\nimportant. DGA has been used to evaluate and mon-\nitor the current condition of transformers for many\ndecades. In addition to the absolute gas concentra-\ntions, the rate of gas increase has become more and\nmore important for the assessment in recent years.\nTrend analysis allows a more precise determination of\nthe actual state due to the trend evaluation. Different\nstandards offer guidelines for threshold values on the\none hand and clear recommendations for measures\nbased on the gas trends on the other. With the help\nof online DGA monitoring systems, incipient faults\ncan be detected at an early stage and appropriate\nmaintenance measures can be initiated.

This exchange means that key gases dissolved\nin the oil dissipate into the ambient air and, vice\nversa, gases from the ambient air are dissolved in the\nmineral oil. The basis of interpretation of the DGA\nis consequently affected . This can lead to a wrong\nassessment of a fault criticality and to a fault being\nclassiﬁed incorrectly. The exchange of gas molecules\ncan be described using various theories of mass trans-\nfer. All these theories ha ve in common that the basis\nis formed by the diffusion coefﬁcients as well as the\nHenry constants. Currently, a model based on these\ntheories is being developed.\nThe Henry constants can only be determined ex-\nactly by empirical means and they are strongly de-\npendent on the temperature. A comparison of the\ndetermined values and the values from the literature\nshows that large differences sometimes occur between\nall values. This is primarily due to how the results are\ndetermined and the strong dependence on the density\nof the oil used. It can be seen that the Henry constants\nof hydrocarbons increase with temperature, whereas\nthose of pure substances decrease. Furthermore, the\nabsolute values of different gases differ greatly. The\ndiffusion coefﬁcients were calculated in this work and\nit can be seen that signiﬁcant differences are depen-\ndent on both the equation used and the temperature.\nT h el i t e r a t u r ea l s os h o w sav e r yl a r g er a n g eo fe r r o r\nover several powers of ten. It would therefore appear\nappropriate in the view of the authors that an exper-\nimental procedure for the de termination of the diffu-\nsion coefﬁcients should be applied in further work.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank the\n“Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft FFG”\n(FFG project number 874800) for ﬁnancial support in carry-\ning out the presented research activities.\nFunding Open access funding provided by Graz University\nof Technology.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Com-\nmons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits\nuse, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in\nany medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit\nto the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were\nmade.
