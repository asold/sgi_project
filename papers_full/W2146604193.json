    "abstract": "Designing a high-frequency power transformer is a complicated task due to its multiple interrelation design procedures, large number of variables, and other relevant factors. Traditional transformer design relies on manual paper work and personal experience, which requires engineering design man-hours and long delivery cycles. In this paper, a developed transformer computer design environment is addressed. It helps engineers to automatically model, simulate, and optimize transformer design using an artificial neural network algorithm and the finite-element method, and delivers a reliable design result. Utilizing the proposed platform, an 8 kW coaxial transformer is successfully designed, tested, and manufactured.",
