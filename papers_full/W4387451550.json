  "abstract": "Abstract The detection of state-sponsored trolls operating in influence campaigns on social media is a critical and unsolved challenge for the research community, which has significant implications beyond the online realm. To address this challenge, we propose a new AI-based solution that identifies troll accounts solely through behavioral cues associated with their sequences of sharing activity, encompassing both their actions and the feedback they receive from others. Our approach does not incorporate any textual content shared and consists of two steps: First, we leverage an LSTM-based classifier to determine whether account sequences belong to a state-sponsored troll or an organic, legitimate user. Second, we employ the classified sequences to calculate a metric named the “Troll Score”, quantifying the degree to which an account exhibits troll-like behavior. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we examine its performance in the context of the 2016 Russian interference campaign during the U.S. Presidential election. Our experiments yield compelling results, demonstrating that our approach can identify account sequences with an AUC close to 99% and accurately differentiate between Russian trolls and organic users with an AUC of 91%. Notably, our behavioral-based approach holds a significant advantage in the ever-evolving landscape, where textual and linguistic properties can be easily mimicked by Large Language Models (LLMs): In contrast to existing language-based techniques, it relies on more challenging-to-replicate behavioral cues, ensuring greater resilience in identifying influence campaigns, especially given the potential increase in the usage of LLMs for generating inauthentic content. Finally, we assessed the generalizability of our solution to various entities driving different information operations and found promising results that will guide future research.",

The activity of these accounts often results in online harms that\nthreatenthehonestyandethicsofconversations,suchasthepropagationofhatespeech,\nincitement of violence, and dissemination of misleading and controversial content. This\nhasbeenobservedinrecentdebatesconcerningtheUkraine-Russiaconﬂict[ 8],Covid-19\npandemic [9–13], as well as the rise of conspiracy theories [14–16]. These fraudulent ac-\ncountsrepresentasigniﬁcantthreattohealthyonlineconversations,whoseactivityhasthe\npotentialtoexacerbatesocietaldivisions andaﬀectthesovereignty ofelections[ 17–22].\nIn the political sphere, Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election repre-\nsents the most prominent case of deceptive online interference campaign [23, 24]. The\nMueller report [25] suggests that Russia engaged in extensive attacks on the U.S. elec-\ntion system to manipulate the outcome of the 2016 voting event. The “sweeping and sys-\ntematic” interference allegedly used bots (i.e., automated accounts) and trolls (i.e., state-\nsponsored human operators) to spread politically biased and false information [26]. In\nthe aftermath of the election, the U.S. Congress released a list of 2752 Twitter accounts\nassociated with Russia’s “Internet Research Agency” (IRA), known as Russian trolls. As a\nresult, signiﬁcant research eﬀorts were launched to identify fraudulent accounts and de-\nceptiveactivityonseveralSMNs.Amongtheseplatforms,Twitter hasbeencontinuously\nworking to eliminate malicious entities involved in information operations across diﬀer-\nent countries [27–29] and diﬀerent geopolitical events [30, 31]. While there are several\nproventechniquesforuncoveringbotaccounts[ 32–38],thedetectionoftrollaccountsis\ncurrently an unsolved issue for the research community, due to several factors tied with\nthehumancharacteroftrolls[ 39].Notethatthroughoutthismanuscript,ourdeﬁnitionof\ntroll is limited to state-sponsored human actors who have a political agenda and operate\nincoordinatedinﬂuencecampaigns,disregardingthusotherhatefulandharassingonline\nactivities tiedwithInternet-mediatedtrollingbehavior.\nRecenteﬀortshavedevisedapproachesforidentifyingtrollsbyleveraginglinguisticcues\nandproﬁlemeta-data[ 40–44].Althoughtheseapproacheshaveshownpromisingresults,\nthey suﬀer from certain limitations. Some of these methods are language-dependent, fo-\ncusing solely on speciﬁc spoken languages associated with the trolls under investigation\n[45,46].OthersareconstrainedtoasingleSMN,relyingonproﬁlemetadataandplatform-\nspeciﬁc information. Furthermore, the ease of imitating language and linguistic cues has\nincreased with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nsimilar technologies. As we look ahead, our ability to detect inﬂuence operations based\nsolelyonlinguisticcuesmaybehinderedbythegrowingrelianceonLLMsforsuchoper-\nations [47, 48]. These signiﬁcant limitations have prompted research eﬀorts to develop\nlanguage- and content-agnostic approaches, as demonstrated in the work of Luceri et\nal. [49]. This approach distinguishes troll accounts by uncovering behavioral incentives\nfromtheirobservedactivitiesusinganInverseReinforcementLearning(IRL)framework.\nEzzeddineetal. EPJDataScience           (2023) 12:46 Page3of21\nGiven that mimicking behaviors and incentives is notably more challenging than imitat-\ning language, incorporating behavioral cues either in addition to or as an alternative to\npurely linguistic-based methods emerges as a promising strategy in an uncertain future,\nparticularly when the cost of generating inauthentic, yet credible, content appears to be\nexceptionallylow[ 50,51].\nInthiswork,weadvancealongthisresearchlineandproposeanovelapproachtoiden-\ntifystate-sponsoredtrollactivitysolelybasedonbehavioralcueslinkedtoaccounts’shar-\ningactivitiesonTwitter.Speciﬁcally,weconsideronlineactivitiesregardlessofthecontent\nshared,thelanguageused,andthelinkedmetadatatoclassifyaccountsastrollsororganic,\nlegitimate users (from now on, simplyusers). Our approach aims to capture cues of be-\nhavior that diﬀerentiate trolls from users by analyzing their interactions and responses\nto feedback. For this purpose, we consider both the actions performed by an account,\nnamelyactiveonlineactivities ,andthefeedbackreceivedbyothers,namely passiveonline\nactivities, e.g., received replies and retweets. We refer to the sequence of active and pas-\nsive activities as atrajectory, in accordance with [49].

Some of these\nEzzeddineetal. EPJDataScience           (2023) 12:46 Page4of21\neﬀorts have proposed linguistic approaches that rely on the content posted by trolls to\nidentify and detect them. For instance, [45] presented a theory-driven linguistic study of\nRussiantrolls’languageanddemonstratedhowdeceptivelinguisticsignalscancontribute\nto accurate troll identiﬁcation. Similarly, [46] proposed an automated reasoning mech-\nanism for hunting trolls on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic, which leverages a\nuniquelinguisticanalysisbasedonadversarialmachinelearningandambienttacticalde-\nception.In[ 53],theauthorsproposedadeeplearningsolutionfortrolldetectiononRed-\nditandanalyzedthesharedcontentusingnaturallanguageprocessingtechniques.Other\nworks have considered fusing users’ metadata and linguistic features, such as [40], which\nusedproﬁledescription,stopwordusage,languagedistribution,andbagofwordsfeatures\nfor detecting Russian trolls. Other approaches have relied on multimedia analysis, com-\nbiningtext,audio,andvideoanalysistodetectimpropermaterialorbehavior[ 54,55].For\ninstance, [54] designed a platform for monitoring social media networks with the aim of\nautomatically tracking malicious content by analyzing images, videos, and other media.\nIn[55],theauthorsattemptedtocapturedisinformationandtrollsbasedontheexistence\nofaﬁrearminimagesusingtheObjectDetectionAPI.Alimitationoftheseworksistheir\nrelianceonthecontentpostedbyaccountsandontheextractionoflinguisticfeaturesfor\ntroll identiﬁcation. In contrast, our approach solely relies on the online behavior of ac-\ncounts, speciﬁcally, the temporal sequence of online activities performed by a user. This\npresents an advantage over previous works, as it is independent of the language used or\ncontentsharedandhas,therefore,thepotentialtogeneralizetoinﬂuencecampaignsorig-\ninatingfromdiversecountriesandberesilienttotheuseofLLMsforgeneratinginauthen-\nticcontent.\nPreviousstudieshaveproposedsequenceanalysisapproachesforidentifying malicious\naccounts.Forexample,Kimetal.[ 56]usedtextandtimeasfeaturestocategorizetrollsinto\nsubgroupsbasedonthetemporalandsemanticsimilarityoftheirsharedcontent.Luceriet\nal.[49]proposedasolutionthatonlyreliesonthesequenceofusers’activityononlineplat-\nforms to capture the incentives that the two classes of accounts (trolls vs. users) respond\nto.Theydetecttrollaccountswithasupervisedlearningapproachfedbytheincentiveses-\ntimatedviaInverseReinforcementLearning(IRL).In[ 57],theauthorsproposedamodel\nbased on users’ sequence of online actions to identify clusters of accounts with similar\nbehavior. However, this approach was found to be ineﬀective in detecting Russian trolls,\nas reported in [49]. Similarly to these approaches, we propose a language- and content-\nagnostic method for identifying trolls based only on the sharing activities performed by\nthe accounts on Twitter. We utilize deep learning, speciﬁcally LSTM, to classify the se-\nquence of activities as belonging to either troll accounts or organic users. We leverage\nthe classiﬁed sequences to quantify the extent to which an account behaves like a troll, a\nfeaturenotavailableinearliermethods.\n3 Problemformulationandtrajectorydeﬁnition\nThis section outlines the objectives of the proposed framework and elucidates the fea-\ntures, variables, and learning tasks integral to it. While existing methods for identifying\ntrollactivity in SMNs relyonlinguistic andmetadata features,our approachstrives to be\nlanguage- and content-agnostic. To achieve this, we rely only on behavioral cues and do\nnotincorporateanytextualormediacontentsharedbytheaccounts,nordoweusetheir\nproﬁle metadata. Consequently, our approach holds the potential for application across\nEzzeddineetal.

We consider theiractive online activities,i n -\ncludinggeneratinganoriginalpost(i.e., tweet),re-sharinganotherpost(i.e., retweet),com-\nmenting an existing post (i.e.,reply), or mentioning another user in a post (i.e.,mention).\nInaddition,wealsoproposetoconsiderthefeedbacktheaccountsreceivefromotherac-\ncounts,namely passiveonlineactivities ,suchasreceivingaretweet(i.e., beingretweeted ),\na comment (i.e.,being replied to), or a mention (i.e.,being mentioned in a post). By con-\nsidering both the actions performed by the accounts and the feedback received, we aim\nto capture the distinct motivations driving trolls’ activity, which may diﬀer from those of\norganic users [49]. The rationale is that trolls might be motivated to pursue their agenda\nregardless of the feedback received from others, while organic users may be inﬂuenced\nby the level of endorsement they receive from the online community. For example, users\nmightbemoremotivatedtogenerateanewtweetwhentheircontentisre-sharedbyoth-\ners, which is also viewed as a form of social endorsement [58, 59], or when they receive\npositive comments.\nTo formalize this approach, we model the SMN Twitter as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP).SimilarlytoLucerietal.[ 49],werepresentTwitterasanenvironmentconstituted\nofmultipleagents(i.e.,Twitteraccounts)thatcanperformasetofactions(i.e., activeon-\nline activities)a n dr e c e i v ef e e d b a c kf r o mt h ee n v i r o n m e n t( i . e . ,passive online activities).\nConsistently with the IRL formulation in [49], we refer to the latter asstates,ast h eyr ep -\nresenttheresponseoftheTwitterenvironment,whereaswerefertotheformeras actions,\nastheyindicate the activeonlineactivities thatanaccountcanperformonTwitter.\nWeconsiderfour actionsthat can be performed by Twitter accounts:\n• Original tweet(tw):to generate original content;\n• Retweet (rt): to re-share content generated by others;\n• Interact with others (in): to interact with other users via replies or mentions;\n• No Action (no):to keepsilent,i.e., theaccountdoesnotperform anyaction.\nFor what pertains tostates, we consider three possible feedback that Twitter accounts\ncanreceive:\n• Retweeted(RT):anoriginaltweetgeneratedbytheaccountisre-shared;\n• Interactedwith (IN):theaccount isinvolved byothersvia replies (i.e., commentsto a\ntweetgeneratedbytheaccount)ormentions;\n• No Interaction(NO):nofeedbackisreceivedby theaccount.\nEvery account can move from one state to another when performing an action, and we\nrefertosuchatransitionasa state-actionpair.Notethatanaccountcanbeonlyinoneof\ntheabove-mentionedstatesandcanperformonlyoneactioninanygivenstate.Byconsid-\neringtheaccounts’timeline,weconstructa sequenceofstate-actionpairsthatreconstruct\nthe(observed)historyoftheaccountonTwitter.Overall,thereexistonly11possiblecom-\nbinations of state-action pairs that form a sequence of an account—the state-action pair\n(NO, no) is not considered as it does not describe any observable activity.

Speciﬁcally, we consider\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, Ada\nBoost, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Figure3 shows AUC, Re-\ncall, Precision, and F1-score of these models forL=100 andL=200. For all metrics, and\nfor both values ofL, all machine learning models show a promising performance (e.g.,\nAUC of 92% and higher), whereas our proposed LSTM-based approach achieves a near-\noptimalperformance,thusoutperformingallothermodels.Morespeciﬁcally,theLSTM-\nbasedapproachshows98%forPrecisionandRecall,signiﬁcantlyhigherthanthatofother\napproaches, which do not exceed 92%.

In this scenario, we build\ntrajectories by sliding a window of lengthLwith a step ofone element over the entire se-\nquenceofstate-actionpairs.Notethatinthiscase,twoconsecutivetrajectoriesoverlapby\nL–1 elements. Indeed, the same state-action pair is considered into several trajectories,\ndepending on its position within the sequence. As previously discussed, the classiﬁca-\ntion of the accounts is based on theTroll Scoremetric. The latter is computed for every\naccount, leveraging the classiﬁcation of its trajectories extracted with a sliding window.\nFinally, the Troll Score of the account under scrutiny is compared to aTroll Score thresh-\nold (see Sect.5.2.2) to assign the account to one of the two classes of accounts (troll vs.\nuser).\nEzzeddineetal.

The results show that our approach identiﬁes account sequences with an\nAUC of nearly 99% and, accordingly, classiﬁes troll and user accounts with an AUC of\n91%,outperformingexistingbehavioralapproaches.Althoughitdoesnotreachthesame\nlevel of performance as language-based techniques, our proposed approach does not re-\nquireaccesstoanycontentsharedinusers’messages,makingitparticularlyrobustinthe\nera of growing LLM usage for inﬂuence campaigns. When analyzing the Troll Score of\ntheexaminedaccounts,weobservedthatthemajorityoftrollsexhibitahighTrollScore,\nindicating that most of their trajectories are classiﬁed as troll activity, while most users\ndisplayalowTrollScore,suggestingthattheirtrajectoriesarepredominantlyclassiﬁedas\nuser activity.
