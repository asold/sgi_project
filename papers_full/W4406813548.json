Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables models to generate more reliable content\nby leveraging the retrieval of external knowledge. In this perspective, we analyze the possible\ncontributions that RAG could bring to health care in equity, reliability, and personalization. Additionally,\nwe discuss the current limitations and challenges of implementing RAG in medical scenarios.\nGenerative artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has recently attracted widespread\nattention across variousﬁelds, including the GPT1,2 and LLaMA3,4 series for\ntext generation, DALL-E5 for image generation, as well as Sora6 for video\ngeneration. In health care systems, generative AI holds promise for appli-\ncations in consulting, diagnosis, treatment, management, and education\n7,8.\nAdditionally, the utilization of generative AI could enhance the quality of\nhealth services for patients while alleviating the workload for clinicians\n8– 10.\nDespite this, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations of\ngenerative AI models, which include susceptibility to biases from pre-\ntraining data\n11, lack of transparency, the potential to generate incorrect\ncontent, and difﬁculty in maintaining up-to-date knowledge, among\nothers7. For instance, large language models (LLMs) were shown to generate\nbiased responses by adopting outdated race-based equations to estimate\nrenal function12. In the process of image generation, biases related to gender,\nskin tone, and geo-cultural factors have been observed13. Similarly, for\ndownstream tasks such as question answering, LLM-generated content is\noften factually inconsistent and lacks evidence for veriﬁcation14.M o r e o v e r ,\ndue to their static knowledge and inability to access external data, generative\nAI models are unable to provide up-to-date clinical advice for physicians or\neffective personalized health management for patients15.\nIn tackling these challenges, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nhas been explored as a potential solution16,17. By providing models with\nexternally retrieved data, RAG can enhance the reliability of generated\ncontent. A typical RAG framework consists of three parts (Fig.1): indexing,\nretrieval, and generation. In the indexing stage, external data is split into\nchunks, encoded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. In the retrieval\nstage, the user’s query is encoded into a vector representation, and then the\nmost relevant information is retrieved through similarity calculations\nbetween the query and the information in the vector database. The retrieval\ntechniques are not limited to dense retrieval but also include sparse and\nhybrid retrieval approaches, and advanced reranking methods can be\nemployed to improve the relevance of retrieved content. In the generation\nstage, both the user’s query and the retrieved relevant information are\nprompted by the model to generate content. Compared to modelﬁne-\ntuning for a speciﬁc task, RAG is generally more computationally efﬁcient\nand has been shown to improve accuracy for knowledge-intensive tasks\n18,\noffering a moreﬂexible paradigm for model updates and integration with\nother AI techniques.\nIn this perspective, we discuss the role of RAG in the context of gen-\nerative AI, particularly its possible applications within health care. We\nexamine RAG’s possible contributions from three aspects: equity, reliability,\nand personalization (Fig.2). Additionally, we explore the limitations of RAG\nin medical application scenarios, emphasizing the need for further research\nto understand the impact of its implementation within health systems\n19.\nPromoting health equity in generative AI applications\nBias reduction\nThe content generated by generative AI models could perpetuate biases\ninherent in the pre-training data, which are reﬂected in aspects including\ndemographic characteristics, political ideologies, and sexual orientations\n12,13,20.\nSuch biases can not only lead to unfair diagnoses and treatments but also\nexacerbate health inequalities for particular populations.\nRAG is able to obtain informationfrom external knowledge sources,\nincluding medical literature, clinical guidelines, and case reports, to optimize\n1Center for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.2Faculty of Arts and Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\n3Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.4Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Medicine Program, Mass General Brigham, Harvard\nMedical School, Boston, MA, USA.5Division of Pharmacy, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.6Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore\nNational Eye Center, Singapore, Singapore.7Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.8Program in Health Services and Systems Research,\nDuke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.9NUS Artiﬁcial Intelligence Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.\ne-mail: liu.nan@duke-nus.edu.sg\nnpj Health Systems|             (2025) 2:2 1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\nthe output of generative AI models17. By retrieving information speciﬁct o\ncertain subpopulations, the model could analyze a patient’s condition from\nmultiple perspectives, potentially reducing the risk of bias contained in the\ngenerated content. For instance, when targeting different gender groups,\nRAG could retrieve researchﬁndings on their speciﬁc physiological pat-\nterns, common disease spectra, clinical manifestations, as well as related\nrecommendations on clinical practice\n21– 23. Similarly, for different ethnic\ngroups, RAG enables access to research reports involving their genetic,\nenvironmental, and lifestyle factors, to understand differences in disease\nincidence rates and unique symptom presentations\n24.F u r t h e r m o r e ,f o r\nother speciﬁc subpopulations (such as different age groups, socioeconomic\nstatuses, etc.), RAG can retrieve tailored medical evidence to help com-\nprehensively understand their unique health needs\n25. Although there remain\nchallenges in ensuring access to high-quality data for underrepresented\ngroups, RAG offers possible solutions to mitigate these issues.\nDisparity mitigation\nHealth disparities present additional challenges to marginalized groups in\naccessing medical resources and health services, potentially hindering the\nachievement of fairness. Although generative AI models are trained on\nFig. 1 | A typical retrieval-augmented generation\nframework. External data isﬁrst encoded into vec-\ntors and stored in the vector database (where vectors\nare mathematical representations of various types of\ndata in a high-dimensional space). In the retrieval\nstage, when receiving a user query, the retriever\nsearches for the most relevant information from the\nvector database. In the generation stage, both the\nuser’s query and the retrieved information are used\nto prompt the model to generate content.\nFig. 2 | Retrieval-augmented generation could\ncontribute to health care in terms of equity,\nreliability, and personalization.Generative AI has\nlimitations such as biased reproduction, lack of\ntransparency, inaccurate information, and static\nknowledge, which hinder its further application in\nhealth care. Retrieval-augmented generation holds\nthe potential to alleviate these issues and drive\nmedical innovation from the perspectives of equity,\nreliability, and personalization.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44401-024-00004-1 Perspective\nnpj Health Systems|             (2025) 2:2 2\nextensive data, the pre-training dataitself exhibits imbalances in repre-\nsenting different groups. For example, 92.64% of the pre-training corpus of\nGPT-3 is derived from English sources, resulting in limited coverage of\ncommunities that use other languages\n1.T h i ss k e w n e s sc o u l dm a k ei tc h a l -\nlenging to meet the medical needs of underrepresented groups.\nCollecting data speciﬁc to these underrepresented populations and\nincorporating it into the RAG system holds the potential to mitigate the\ndisparities in health care. Speciﬁcally, in low-resource regions, the RAG\nsystem might leverage knowledge that integrates local medical research\nliterature, clinical guidelines, and practical experiences to provide more\nrelevant diagnostic and treatment advice to local residents\n26.W h i l es o m e\nregional guidelines may not be digitized, audio and image recognition\ntechnologies could convert this information into digital format, creating\nregion-speciﬁc contextual databases\n27. Similarly, by developing high-quality\nmultilingual medical knowledge bases, RAG can play an important role in\ncross-language information retrievaland knowledge integration, with the\npotential to eliminate barriers posed bylanguage differences. However, it is\nworth noting that even the most advanced LLMs currently support only a\nlimited number of mainstream languages, which limits the effectiveness of\nRAG in multilingual environments, particularly when dealing with lan-\nguages in low-resource setting\n28. Additionally, RAG systems are able to\nretrieve pre-collected materials and present them in various formats, such as\ntext, images, and videos, to facilitatepatient education. This way allows the\nexplanation of complex medical concepts to patients with diverse educa-\ntional and cultural backgrounds\n29.\nGenerating reliable content\nMistake alleviation\nOne signiﬁcant challenge of generative AI models in health care is their\npotential to generate incorrect or unfaithful information7,8. Although there\nare already speciﬁc models pre-trained on large amounts of medical data,\nsuch as Med-PaLM2 and Med-Gemini, the phenomenon of“hallucination”\ncannot be avoided29,30. This issue is extremely sensitive since any false\ninformation related to disease diagnosis, treatment plans, or medication\nguidance will likely cause serious harm to patients\n31.\nFor example, medication errors are a major category of medical mis-\ntakes, resulting in numerous patient fatalities each year32,33.D u r i n gt h es t a g e\nof converting prescription instructions into a standard format, pharmacy\ntechnicians may incorrectly record dosage, frequency, or route of\nadministration\n32. Additionally, when patients transfer medications from\ntheir original packaging to other containers, it becomes difﬁcult for phar-\nmacists to recognize the medications,which could lead to omission errors33.\nGiven that electronic health record recommendations and alerts are often\nimprecise, and traditional natural language processing methods require\nextensive human annotation, generative AI offers an attractive solution.\nHowever, generative AI models sometimes also generate incorrect drug\ninformation, leading to further harm. RAG might help to address some of\nthese issues. By searching various drug information, RAG can automatically\nparse prescriptions at the data entry stage and generate more accurate\nmedication guidance, thereby reducing medical errors caused by informa-\ntion transmission. Moreover, in the process of drug identiﬁcation, a mul-\ntimodal RAG system has the capabilityto recognize the appearance features\nof drugs, such as color, shape, and imprints. By matching these character-\nistics with database information, the RAG system could generate reliable\ndrug information to serve as a reference for pharmacists, thereby improving\nthe efﬁciency of drug identiﬁcation. However, it is crucial to emphasize that\nthese applications are still in the early stage of development and require\nthorough validation before implementation.\nTransparency enhancement\nThe “black box” nature of generative AI models makes it difﬁcult to explain\nhow speciﬁc diagnoses or treatment recommendations are derived. This\nlack of transparency not only undermines the trust of physicians and\npatients in the generated content but, more importantly, it may pose serious\nmedical risks and ethical concerns. Although some research has attempted\nto enhance models’ reasoning abilities and transparency through approa-\nches like chain of thought\n34, multi-agent discussion35, and post-hoc\nattribution36, there are still limitations in medical applications37.\nIn comparison, RAG is able to retrieve traceable medical facts from\nexternal knowledge bases, promoting the generation of more transparent\ncontent; however, this process still requires manual veriﬁcation38.I n\nassisting clinical decision-making, RAG may provide the sources of infor-\nmation upon which the diagnoses are based, including clinical guidelines,\nmedical evidence, and clinical cases. By categorizing queries into simple\nfactual searches or multi-step reasoning processes, RAG can further clarify\nhow different types of information contribute to a given recommendation,\nenhancing the transparency of its decision-making. Additionally, some\nresearch utilizes external medicalknowledge graphs (such as the Uniﬁed\nMedical Language System) or self-construed knowledge graphs to enhance\nthe diagnostic capabilities of models\n14,39. Based on a given query, the RAG\nsystem ﬁrst identiﬁes relevant nodes in the knowledge graph, such as dis-\neases, symptoms, or medications, and then retrieves both direct relations\nand multi-hop paths connecting thesenodes. This process allows the RAG\nsystem to extract structured, relevant knowledge efﬁciently and leverage it to\nprovide clear diagnostic explanations\n14.\nPersonalizing health care services\nHealth management\nRAG also shows potential for personalized health care management. Gen-\nerative AI models lack the ability to incorporate personal information,\nmaking it difﬁcult to offer effective health services\n8. For example, they may\nnot be aware of a user’s allergies and recommend allergenic foods. In con-\ntrast, the RAG system could integratehealth data and lifestyle habits of\nindividuals to build a comprehensive personal proﬁle, which might enable\nmore customized health guidance.\nFor patients, by connecting their medical records and clinical data\nwhile allowing for real-time updates, the RAG system has the capability to\nprovide more precise health management guidance. For instance, for\npatients with chronic conditions whoneed to take multiple medications\nlong-term, the system can generate medication reminders according to\nphysicians’ prescriptions, ensuring that patients take their medications\ncorrectly and timely, thereby improving medication adherence. For the\npublic, the RAG system can analyze personal health data, lifestyle, envir-\nonmental factors, and genetic information (if granted access by individual\nusers) to identify potential health risks. In this way, the RAG system pro-\nvides personalized health recommendations, including diet, exercise, and\nstress management, effectively promoting disease prevention. For example,\nfor individuals with a high genetic risk of heart disease, the system could\nrecommend speciﬁc dietary plans and appropriate exercise regimens to\nreduce the risk of eventuallydeveloping the disease.\nPrecision medicine\nPrecision medicine aims to maximize medical effectiveness and patient\nbeneﬁts by tailoring treatment strategies according to a patient’s genetic\nproﬁle, environmental inﬂuences, lifestyle, and other individual factors40.\nAlthough current generative AI models have demonstrated potential to\nassist in clinical decision-making35,41, they still face challenges in precision\nmedicine42, as they struggle to utilize highly individualized patient data to\nprovide precise treatment recommendations.\nRAG might offer unique advantages for advancing precision medicine.\nBy retrieving a patient’s complex clinical and molecular data, the RAG\nsystem empowers physicians to develop more accurate and personalized\ntreatment plans tailored to each patient43. For example, generative AI\nmodels typically provide similar general clinical advice to cancer patients\nexhibiting similar signs and symptoms. However, in reality, these patients\ngenerally have different disease progression and prognoses due to differ-\nences in their biomarkers (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites, host cells,\nand microbiomes)44. Although collecting and protecting such sensitive data\nremains a challenge, RAG could better leverage this information for pre-\ncision medicine practices. Speciﬁcally, the RAG system may be able to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44401-024-00004-1 Perspective\nnpj Health Systems|             (2025) 2:2 3\ncomprehensively analyze a patient’s biomarkers, classify them into more\ngranular subgroups, and recommend appropriate personalized treatment\nplans to physicians based on established clinical guidelines.\nDiscussion\nRAG may enable better integratio n of generative AI into health\nsystems and bring more innovative applications in consulting, diag-\nnosis, treatment, management, and education. Despite the potential\nof RAG systems in health care, they also face signiﬁcant limitations.\nFirst, the retrieval of external knowledge can introduce additional\nbiases, since the sources themselv es might contain biases. Second,\ndue to the lack of suf ﬁcient high-quality information on under-\nrepresented groups, RAG systems may become less effective in such\ncases, with the generated content relying more on the knowledge of\nthe models themselves. As a result, minority groups are unlikely to\nbeneﬁt much from existing RAG systems. Third, although RAG\nsystems can enhance transparency by providing evidence, deter-\nmining which parts of a response are derived from which pieces of\nretrieved knowledge is dif ﬁcult without human inspection. Mean-\nwhile, possible knowledge conﬂicts between retrieved documents or\nwith the model ’s internal knowledge highlight the importance of\nsource validation, though effective implementation remains\nchallenging\n45.F o u r t h ,R A Gs y s t e m sf a c ecertain privacy risks, as\nsensitive information stored in retrieval databases can be extracted\nthrough designed prompts. Implementing appropriate privacy pro-\ntection mechanisms is crucial to mitigate the risk of information\nleakage in generated content, especially when handling sensitive\nmedical information\n46. Therefore, we suggest a multidisciplinary\ncollaboration among clinicians, re searchers, stakeholders, and reg-\nulators to explore how RAG can be used more equitably, reliably, and\neffectively to improve existing practices in health care. Such colla-\nboration should focus on addressing practical challenges, including\nensuring interoperability with EHR systems, building clinician trust,\nand providing adequate training for health care professionals to fully\nharness the potential of RAG\n47.\nData availability\nNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\nReceived: 12 October 2024; Accepted: 22 November 2024;\nReferences\n1.
