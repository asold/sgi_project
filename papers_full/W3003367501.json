Introduction\nThis research is an extension of the article titled “Optimal Allocation of Transformers in Electri-\ncal Distribution Systems Considering Attenuation and Capacity Constraints”, previously presen-\nted at the 4th INCISCOS 2019 International Conference held in the city of Quito - Ecuador.\nTraditional electrical networks become smart grids if communications infrastructure is \nadded, some researches about technologies are described considering optimal communica-\ntions and infrastructure in HAN (Maldonado, 2017), NAN (Quishpe, Padilla & Ruiz, 2019; Ruiz, Ma-\nsache & Inga, 2018; Ruiz Maldonado & Inga, 2019) and WAN (Ruiz & Inga, 2019; Ruiz, Masache & \nDomínguez, 2018).\n1 Universidad Politécnica Salesiana, Quito-Ecuador (spinzon@est.ups.edu.ec).\n2 Universidad Politécnica Salesiana, Quito-Ecuador (syanezr@est.ups.edu.ec).\n3 Universidad Politécnica Salesiana, Quito-Ecuador (mruizm@ups.edu.edu.ec).\n85\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nDistribution systems play an essential role since it interconnects the transmission sys-\ntem and the users. Research efforts in the area have been directed toward developing methodo-\nlogies for optimal design, planning, and expansion of modern electrical distribution systems \n(Carrión Galarza & González Sánchez, 2019). \nTraditional design methodologies must minimize the associated costs, such as inves-\ntment, energy losses, operation and maintenance while keeping satisfactory levels of security \nand reliability. Information about the electrical distribution network, such as location and ratings \nof generators, substations, transformers and lines, and the electric energy demand of the users \nis key for solving this optimization problem. However, publicly available data from a real network \nis generally scarce. Therefore, considering the demand increase, when planning distribution \nnetworks, typically requires the use of artificial models that emulate the real infrastructure. The \noptimal design of smart distribution networks is a combinatorial problem defined as NP-comple-\nte, next papers show different methodologies for design electrical networks (Liu et al., 2017; Xie \net al., 2018); where the connection between customers and the main node on a georeferenced \nscenario is build using a model based on minimum spanning tree (MST) techniques. \nThe project deals with the optimal location of distribution transformers using a modified-\nprim algorithm based on the minimal cost of low voltage network between transformers and \nusers. Secondly, clustering algorithms are used to break the dataset (number of distribution \ntransformers) up into groups, then the k-medoids algorithm determines a defined number of \nclusters, which can be used as primary feeders. The next stage deals with the built-up of the \nmedium voltage network based on modified-prim (Gholizadeh-Roshanagh, Najafi-Ravadanegh \n& Hosseinian, 2018; Xie et al., 2018) to determine the lowest path between the main substa-\ntion and distribution transformers on a georeferenced path. The minimum spanning tree (Li, \nMao, Zhang & Li, 2016) is estimated with the Prim algorithm and graph theory. Prim is used to \nfinding the subset of branches and all vertices that will constitute the tree. The constraint re-\nlated to the losses due to distances is taken into account during the process. In each iteration, \nthe algorithm increases the tree size, starting from an initial vertex representing a transformer \nand successively adding vertices corresponding to the users, such that the distances between \nthe transformer and the users are minimized, initial works in telecommunications. This process \nconsiders variables such as location of the householders’ main feeders, location, and ratings of \ntransformers and path of medium and low voltage along the streets; it also takes into account \nconstraints such as power flow balance/equality, the location of a substation, the path of lines, \nbus voltage and ratings and coverage of each transformer. Regarding the latter, any transfor-\nmer that does not satisfy the requirements is to replace. The proposed model in this paper is \nto develop considering a multigraph, that defines a layer for the medium voltage network and \nanother layer for the low-voltage network, ensuring the connectivity of users in the deployment \ndepending on demand. To achieve the objectives a deployment is carried out in urban areas \nusing an open street map (OSM) (Once, 2017) file with the information of longitude and latitude \nwithin a model developed in Matlab. The efficiency of the model is estimated for varying den-\nsities of the electric load, to assess adaptation capability and resources available to fulfill the \ndemand of a different number of users. The k-means algorithm is used for generating the clus-\nters, and the nodes inside an area are treated as PQ loads. Such a network is generated through \nthe Delaunay-Voronoi triangulation (Budka, K., Deshpande, J. and Thottan, 2014; Ciechanowicz, \nPelzer, Bartenschlager, & Knoll, 2017), thus resulting in a partially connected mesh. If such mesh \nnetwork shows a redundancy larger than desired, branches are iteratively suppress starting \nwith the one connecting two nodes with the highest degree. \n86\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nHenceforth, this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology of \nthe problem, where the proposed algorithms and procedures for optimization are formulated. \nSection III presents results and discussion, describing and analyzing the information obtained \nby applying the optimization model on simulation scenarios with different parameters. Finally, in \nsection V, the conclusions and recommendations about this research.\n2. Methodology\nPlanning electrical distribution networks involves, among other aspects, taking some initial \nconsiderations that allow defining preliminary parameters to their implementation on the op-\ntimization model. The considerations included in the research respond to the deployment of a \nnew power grid. This implies that existing distribution network is not considered, or in turn, it \ndoes not exist. Items considered, such as location of users, candidate sites and possible routes \nfor the deployment of the electricity network, are identified using georeferenced data from the \nOpenStreetMap platform after their processing in MATLAB. In addition to characterization of the \nscenario, the object of the implementation of georeferenced information lies in the ability to \nfacilitate the obtaining of coordinates where the location of the electrical transformers is ade-\nquate. Being this, one of the results obtained through the model presented. Table 1 shows the \nvariables of equations and algorithms shown later.\nTable 1. Variables and notation\nNomenclature\nX, Y Array of user and candidate sites locations, respectively.\nState variable of the -th candidate site.\nMinimal spacing constant between transformers.\nDistance between each of the active transformers.\nDemand from each user.\nMaximum transformation capability.\nNumber of regions for clustering.\nIndex assigned to each user and medoid locations, respectively.\nVector of demand assigned to each user.\nGraph obtained by applying the Prim algorithm.\nPreliminary array of logical values of active sites and assigned users.\nTransformer(s) assigned to a user\nCoordinates for the transformer location.\nResistivity and cross-section of the conductor.\nSet of users assigned to a transformer.\nTransformer power.\n87\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nDistance between the user and their assigned transformer.\nResistance and current along the section between transformer and user’s meter\nLine voltage and estimated power factor over the secondary circuit\nVoltage drops of secondary circuits.\nBeing  the number of users and  the number of candidate sites, it is sought to minimize \nthe number of candidate sites considering the spacing between transformation centers, and their \nmaximum capability; which must be greater than the sum of the power demanded by users con-\nnected to the equipment, ensuring that the specified transformability will not be exceeded. The \nmathematical expressions that respond to the above are presented below, being (1) the objective \nfunction, (2) spacing restriction and (3) maximum transformation capability restriction.\n (1)\n  (2)\n (3)\nOnce the scenario is characterized and after defining the candidate sites for the location \nof transformers, taking into account the characteristics of the design area; a scenario where a \nlarge number of users are available could involve excessive complexity to perform optimization \nin large blocks, so it is chosen to cluster the design area in a way that makes routing easier by \ncreating subnets. Sectorization is done using the k-medoids clustering method, thus dividing \nthe environment into regions while building a graph connecting the different nodes in the geo-\nreferenced area. The clustering result is also used for assigning random loads to each user. Also, \nDelaunay and Voronoi triangulation methods are used to visualize sectorization. After that, it \nis proposed to solve the problem of optimal location using the modified-Prim and Greedy algo-\nrithms. The above process is carried out when applying Algorithm 1. \nAlgorithm 1: Clustering and Optimal Location of Electrical Transformers\n1: procedure Input( , )\n2: Step 1: Create subregions\n3:\n4:\n5:\n6: Step 2: Random demand assignment \n7:\n8: Step 3: Modified Prim Algorithm\n88\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\n9:\n10: Step 4: Greedy-SCP \n11:\n12: Step 5: Eliminate redundancy\n13:\n14:\n15:\n16:\n17:\n18:\n19:\n20:\n21: procedure Output( w\nFrom Algorithm 2, modified-Prim method allows building a minimum expansion tree over \nthe network. The graph obtained includes all the vertices of the network where the sum of its \nedges is minimum, the weights of the graph are the distances between users and candidate si-\ntes obtained by the haversine formula. On the other hand, the Greedy algorithm allows obtaining \nan array with logical values that show those active transformers that will meet the demand of \nthe different user blocks. However, the array of logical values obtained with Greedy can present \nminor problems, such as providing a solution that includes more than one transformation unit \nfor the same user, which would result in incorrect transformer sizing and, in general, unwanted \nredundancy errors. Therefore, the algorithm considers that particularity and corrects it.\nThe procedure implemented by Algorithm 2 allows determining the capability of the trans-\nformers and after the nominal power of each transformer has been obtained, the algorithm per-\nforms a calculation of the existing distances for the set of users covered by a transformer using \nthe haversine formula, this procedure is applied to the full extent of the distances between a \nuser and its assigned transformer; with this data, voltage drop calculations are performed ba-\nsed on the parameters of the established conductor, as well as electrical factors typical of the \nnetwork and demand, such as voltages in secondary and power factor.\nAlgorithm 2: Sizing and voltage drops in secondary circuits calculation\n1: procedure Input( , )\n2: Step 1: Transformer sizing\n3:\n4:\n5:\n89\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\n6:\n7:\n8:\n9:\n10:\n11: Step 2: Calculate distances \n12:\n13: Step 3: Calculate voltage drops\n14:\n15:\n16:\n17:\n18:\n19: procedure Output(\n3. Results and Discussion\nMATLAB R2018b software is used to implement the proposed methodology on a computer with \nan Intel Core i7-6500U processor, 8 Gb of RAM, and Windows 10. The proposed scenario has 824 \nusers and 163 candidate sites located at the intersections of the georeferenced area, obtained \nafter recognition by interpreting geographical information. The proposed georeferenced area is \nshown in Figure 1, along with the location of the candidate sites, users and clustering of the area.\nFigure 1. Proposed georeferenced area with the location of candidate sites and users.\n\n90\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nTable 2 shows results achieved after applying the optimization methodology on the pro-\nposed scenario. In order to obtain these values, the spacing and maximum transformation ca-\npability parameters considered were 100 meters and 200 KVA, respectively. \nAs can be seen, 18 active sites are obtained, which refer to the set of coordinates marked \nby the model as optimal to the location of transformation centers. The number of active sites \nrepresents eleven percent of the total available sites. On the other hand, while the set of trans-\nformation units to be deployed on the network does not guarantee a total supply of demand, \nsince the coverage is not 100 %; the number of users not supplied is minimal, so they could be \nassigned to a transformer with low loadability. In this sense, the table also shows information \nabout the maximum and minimum number of users assigned to a transformer. This data shows \nthe condition of certain units in which the number of users is minimal, so they can withstand \nhigher load and therefore will be able to supply the entire demand. \nTable 2. Summary of parameters obtained after applying the optimization methodology\nParameter Obtained Value\nNumber of active sites 18\nNumber of users 804\nElectric coverage [%] 97.573\nMaximum number of assigned users 153\nMinimum number of assigned users 1\nFigure 2 shows the georeferenced area with the deployment of the transformation units \nlocated at the coordinates rated as optimal. In addition, the primary of the electrical network \ncovering each of the active transformation units is shown. This network constitutes a possible \nroute for the deployment of the power grid.\nFigure 2. Optimal allocation of transformers in the georeferenced area and deployment of the feeder\n\n91\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nTable 3 shows the capability of each transformation unit located in the georeferenced \narea. Values presented are based on standard values. The maximum capability obtained af-\nter sizing reaches 150 KVA in a single unit, ensuring compliance with the maximum capability \nconstraint.\nTable 3. Power capability of the transformation units\nTransformer Power [KVA] Transformer Power [KVA] Transformer Power [KVA]\nT1 150 T7 75 T13 100\nT2  30 T8 15 T14 30\nT3 100 T9 75 T15 30\nT4 50 T10 50 T16 15\nT5 100 T11 30 T17 15\nT6 100 T12 15 T18 15\nVoltage drops, corresponding to the secondary circuits of the network, cover the sections \nbetween each user and its assigned transformer. Figure 3 shows these drops obtained by using \nthe following parameters: voltage 120 volts, power factor 0.85 and 1/0 aluminum conductor. Thus, \nthe maximum voltage drop would be around 0.04 volts, which is 0.033 % of the total voltage. \nHowever, most users would have drops ranging from 0.01 to 0.025 volts. Consequently, it can \nbe said that the expected voltage attenuation should not violate the standards for distribution \nsystems. Voltage drops are calculated only in secondary circuits due to the model handles user \nand active transformer locations. So, with such parameters, it is possible to calculate distances \nand therefore voltage drops between users and their assigned transformer. The voltage drop in \nprimaries is not addressed since the model does not perform optimal network routing. In addition, \nFigure 3 shows the distribution of users for each of the active transformers, providing an overview \nof the coverage of each transformer. Furthermore, the maximum and minimum number of users \nconnected to a transformer is appreciated, in accordance with data shown above in Table 2.\nFigure 3. Voltage drops in secondary circuits for the proposed scenario\n\n92\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nAnother aspect to be evaluated is the percentage of electrical coverage achieved after the \nlocation of the transformation centers. Since no coverage constraints are introduced, this pa-\nrameter is not controlled, however, the results achieved expose a marked trend. Figure 4 shows \ncoverage values obtained after applying the optimization methodology considering changes in \nthe restrictive parameters of the model. The minimum coverage values are placed when using \nas the spacing distance of 20 meters. For this distance, even when the maximum transform ca-\npability changes, coverage remains fixed at approximately 22 %. Similarly, it occurs for spacing \nvalues of 30 and 40 meters, with coverage values of 45 % and 67 %, respectively. For spacing \nvalues of 80 meters, coverage improves considerably, except for results obtained for powers \nless than 100 KVA, the coverage reaches approximately 95 %. \nFigure 4. Network coverage by variations in model restrictions\nFollowing the trend, coverage below the tested minimum distance is expected to be low \nand above the maximum distance tested would be greater than 95 %. However, the distance \nparameters used as constraints do not fit the needs of an actual distribution system. Since even \nthe distance between poles should be commonly greater than 40 meters. Even, as a minimum \nspacing a distance less than that value, involves violating the minimum distance requirement \nbetween posts and, considering a spacing value equal to 40 meters, would imply the possibility \nof placing a transformer on each post, which nor does it fit the reality. Generally, transformers \nare located at distances of not less than 100 meters and as presented above, the coverage \nachieved under that distance is around 96 %.\n93\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nFigure 5. Execution times resulting from variations in spacing and transformation capability\nFigure 5 shows data regarding execution times as a result of applying the optimization \nmethodology and the variation of its restrictions. It should be noted from this figure that the \nmarkers refer to the maximum and minimum powers used for the creation of the different sce-\nnarios, which correspond to 350 KVA and 15KVA, respectively. These values correspond to the \npower horizons used, however, among these values there are more power parameters. Having \nsaid that, it can be observed that for a spacing of 20 meters all the results obtained yield the \nsame asset site numbers, specifically, 53. Although the number of active transformes is the \nsame, execution times experience an increase, starting from 11 hours, for the minimum horizon, \nto 21 hours, on the maximum horizon. Similarly it happens with the spacing of 30 meters, obtai-\nning a number of active sites of 59, in this case the execution time presents a decrease, so the \nmaximum execution time is 29 hours and the minimum 1 hour. For the spacing of 40 meters, \ndifferent numbers of active sites were obtained, starting with 64 to reach 58 active sites, with \ntimes ranging from 1 hour to 9 hours, being that, in the same way, there is an increase in the \nexecution time. Finally, with the spacing of 80 meters, different numbers of active sites were \nobtained forming a growing curve in time and decreasing in number of transformers. In the lat-\nter, times range from 1 hour to 22 hours.\n5. Conclusions and Recommendations\nThe optimization methodology presented uses georeferenced information for the characteriza-\ntion of the scenario. It includes identifying users, candidate sites, and possible routes for net-\nwork deployment. This work considers the deployment of a new power grid and the model does \nnot identify or consider existing networks. So, in a scenario where a network is already deployed, \nthe results can help assess whether the current location of the transformation units is adequa-\nte and if it is not, to consider the relocation of the transformer, this, accompanied by specific \nanalyses as economic implications.\n94\nEnfoque UTE, V.11 -N.1, Ene. 2020, pp. 84-95\nVoltage drops achieved do not exceed the typical maximum permissible values stipula-\nted by regulations for electrical distribution systems. The resulting values show an adequate \nlocation of the transformers, as their reduced magnitudes respond to a well-achieved proximity \nbetween users and their assigned transformer, this implies that the distance between them is \nsmall and as a result, little attenuation is achieved.\nAssignment of users to each transformation unit is not uniform, presenting cases in \nwhich a transformation unit covers just a single user. This is justified in cases where the user \nhas a high electrical demand. And even if the above does not stick to reality, such units can be \nconsidered in the expansion of the distribution system.\nThe coverage obtained in scenarios with spacings less than 80 meters is limited, howe-\nver, the use of such parameters is not applicable to the requirements of a distribution network, \nsince, as explained during the analysis, some of these values involve the possibility of placing \ntransformers on each of the poles in the distribution network. With spacings greater than 80 \nmeters the coverage reaches quite acceptable levels, above 95 %. Despite achieving accepta-\nble levels for certain ranges, future research should include coverage restrictions to ensure full \ndemand supply, even if the restrictions do not adhere to the actual requirements of a distribu-\ntion network.\nBibliography\nBudka, K., Deshpande, J. & Thottan, M.
