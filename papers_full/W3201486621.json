  "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has always been a goal as well as a challenge in the scientific field with a whole new world being accessible to people by accomplishing various achievements in the past decades. However, in the last many years, tremendous popularity has been received by the interactive computer games involving multi-user virtual environment which has been the prime attraction for millions of users around the world. This paper focuses on AI agents along with exploring the progress towards super intelligent AI and the roles played by artificial intelligence and virtual worlds in its development. It follows a unique approach to give an unbiased view on the various problems and the relation between them. There are namely two benefits from this research: firstly, evolution in science and technology requires a profound understanding on the advanced AI agents in the virtual worlds, and secondly, the virtual worlds have always been a magnificent platform for research on the challenging problems faced in the domain of Artificial Intelligence.",
