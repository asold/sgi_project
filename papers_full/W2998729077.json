INTRODUCTION\nIn the electrical power system, the transformer plays a very\nimportant role in energy conversion and distribution. So far,\na large number of power transformers in-service are almost\napproaching their designed life (25-30 years in general).\nHowever, for economic and other safety considerations, most\nof them are not replaced and still functioning satisfactorily.\nAs the insulation material of the transformer usually exposes\nin a multi-stress coexisting condition including the thermal,\nthe electrical, and the mechanical effect as well as the chem-\nical erosion during service, degradation of the insulation\nand aging of the transformer is inevitable [1], [2]. It thus\nbecomes crucial to evaluate the ‘‘real age’’ or ‘‘real life’’ of\na transformer for scheduling its retirement, and also helps to\nschedule the maintenance and replacement plan.\nAs two coupled parts for the oil-paper insulation system\nof the oil-immersed transformers, the kraft paper usually\ncoordinates with mineral oil or nature ester to ensure the\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Canbing Li.\nsafe and stable operation of the transformer. The kraft paper,\nformed with 90% cellulose, 6%-7% lignin, and pentosans,\ncan become very brittle once exposed to thermal, electrical\nstresses, or both of them within a speciﬁed period [3]–[5]. For\ncellulose, the depolymerization process can reduce its chain\nlength of polymer molecular during long-term service, thus\nresulting in a decrease of the mechanical strength. Usually,\nthe loss in mechanical strength of the kraft paper can be\nmeasured by the degree of polymerization (DP). For newly\nmanufactured paper, its DP typically varies from 1100 to\n1600 [6], [7], which can be reduced along with its aging. Once\nthe value of DP decreases to 200, it is considered the kraft\npaper almost reaches its end-of-life.\nDuring aging, the insulating paper can generate some\nfeature byproducts like furaldehyde and furans compounds\nas a single or synthetic effect of pyrolysis, hydrolysis, and\noxidation [8]–[10]. Most of such hydrocarbon byproducts\nwill be absorbed in Kraft paper only with a small portion\ndissolved in oil, which has been utilized as one of the reli-\nable and effective indicators for aging assessment of the\ninsulating paper [4], [11]. Once incipient faults (both the\n9692 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/VOLUME 8, 2020\nS.

The main components of\nthese gases are hydrogen (H 2), methane (CH 4), acetylene\n(C2H2), ethylene (C 2H4), ethane (C 2H6), carbon monoxide\n(CO), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) [12]–[14]. By utilizing such\nbyproducts obtained from oil tests and routine inspection,\nit is feasible to conduct a comprehensive health condition\nassessment of the oil/paper insulation system or even an entire\ntransformer.\nAlthough studies prove that the gas ratio of CO 2 and CO is\nuseful for a rough estimation of the service life for insulating\npaper [15], [16], it is still hard to determine the service life\nof a transformer based on such ratio since this value can\nvary greatly for different units. Approaches like the IEEE/IEC\nmethod, the kinetic model, and some statistical techniques are\nmainly focused on the thermal effect on the insulation of the\ntransformer [17]–[19], so a complete load and temperature\nproﬁle are thus needed. Such information, however, is always\nincomplete. Sometimes the estimated life of a transformer\nthrough these approaches can be very old and even reaching\nthe end-of-life, but they are still functioning well, while a\nparticular transformer with an estimated younger life may\nhave kinds of defects or even retired before that time.\nFor power utilities, the managers may pay more attention to\nthe health condition of a transformer group, or namely, their\nfocus is on which unit exhibits the most miserable state in\nthe ﬂeet. Face with this, the health index is thus regarded\nas an effective tool for achieving such a goal [20]–[32].\nBy combining condition monitoring data obtained from types\nof measurements, routine tests, maintenance records, failure\nstatistics, and also the experience summarized from human\nexperts, it is feasible to implement a comprehensive health\nassessment of power transformer. From the health index\nresult of all transformers, it is possible to rank a single unit\namong the ﬂeet. Furthermore, one can also judge whether\nthe condition of a single unit is beyond or below the average\nhealth level of the population through regression of the health\nindex results. This will give a more intuitive reﬂection of a\nsingle unit’s health condition, and thus provides a reference\nto maintainers pay more attention to those below the average.\nBased on the health index mentioned above, a new\napproach for estimating the ‘‘apparent age’’ of power trans-\nformer using the results of a probabilistic health index given\nin [33] is proposed in this paper. The apparent age can\nbe useful for making a judgment of a single transformer\nﬂeet, and also makes it easy to select the poorest condition\nunit from a transformer group. Therefore, it is helpful for\nranking transformers among a ﬂeet and useful for guiding\nmaintenance, replacement, and investment strategy. There\nare essential differences between the proposed apparent age\nand the traditional service life or transformer age since the\nformer can be taken as a metric for assessing the overall\nhealth condition of a single transformer among a large group.\nIt is different from traditional methods for transformer life\nFIGURE 1.

Case studies and discussions are carried out in\nSection IV. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.\nII. REALIZATION OF PROBABILISTIC HEALTH INDEX\nThis section will brieﬂy introduce how a probabilistic health\nindex is created based on the Bayesian information fusion\ntheory. A brief review of general approaches to calculating the\nhealth index is ﬁrstly given in Section A. By summarizing the\nshortcomings of general health indices, a probabilistic health\nindex is then proposed in Section B.\nA. BRIEF REVIEW OF TRANSFORMER HEALTH INDEX\nThe transformer health index is a comprehensive index that\nintegrates a variety of condition monitoring data to indicate\nthe overall health condition of a transformer. Since various\nnew techniques and advanced measures have been applied\nfor transformer condition monitoring, the health index thus\nbecomes more and more reliable.\nSo far, different types of health indices have been devel-\noped. Among all, the weighted-score-sum based health\nindex has been widely accepted and put into service by\npower utilities [20]–[24], while the artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) algorithms-based health index is more popular in\nacademia [25]–[32]. The realization of the two different cat-\negories of health index is summarized below.\n1) WEIGHTED-SCORE-SUM BASED HEALTH INDEX\nThe weighted-score-sum based transformer health index can\nbe realized as a summation of weighted-score for different\ntypes of condition monitoring data, e.g., in [20], seven gases\n(H2, CH 4, C 2H2, C 2H4, C 2H6, CO, and CO 2), six oil test\nparameters (including dielectric strength, IFT, acid number,\nwater content, color, dissipation factor), furan compound,\ndissolved gas analysis (DGA) of on-load tap changer (OLTC),\nloading proﬁles, and maintenance records are taken into con-\nsideration to calculated the transformer health index. As illus-\ntrated in Figure 1, such health index is easy to be realized\nVOLUME 8, 2020 9693\nS. Liet al.: Probabilistic Health Index-Based Apparent Age Estimation for Power Transformers\nFIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms based transformer health\nindex.\nusing the following equation.\nHI =\nn∑\ni=1\nki ×HIi, HIi =\nm∑\nj=1\nSjwj/\nm∑\nj=1\nwj (1)\nwhere HIi is the local health index of the transformer, i.e.\nhealth index for oil or tap changer, ki is the corresponding\nweight of HIi with ∑wi =1, Sj is the score of a speciﬁc\ncondition monitoring data and wj is the identical weight\nfactor, n is the number of condition monitoring data.\nThe condition score Sj is generally determined according to\nassessment functions (or score rules) that have been deﬁned\nin published papers or relevant guidelines/standards or sub-\njectively assigned by human experts, or even a synergy of\nthem. In Figure 1, the condition data can be either digital\nor textual (e.g., the water content in the oil is digital, but\nmaintenance records of a bushing are in text).\nFor the weighted-score-sum based health index, the local\nor partial health index HIi can refer to different items, it can\neither represent a sub-index of a number of condition moni-\ntoring data with similar attributes or stand for the local health\ncondition of a certain part/component of a transformer. For\nexample, the HIi mentioned in [22] indicated the overall\ncondition of different gases dissolved in transformer oil.\nHowever, in [23], it was used as a local index to represent\nthe condition of the transformer winding.\n2) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS-BASED\nHEALTH INDEX\nExcept for the abovementioned weighted-score-sum based\napproaches, some AI algorithms that applied for fault clas-\nsiﬁcation, regression or prediction, fuzzy synthesis, and\nprobability inference, etc., also show their applicability in\ntransformer health index calculation. For these approaches,\nthe AI algorithms usually act as an inference engine, while\nkinds of transformer condition monitoring data and the health\nindex are taken as their input and the output, respectively. This\nkind of health indices are shown in Figure 2 and can also be\nrealized through the following formula (2).\nHI =f (v1, v2, ··· , vi, ··· , vn) (2)\nwhere vi is the i-th type of condition monitoring data collected\nfrom the power transformer, while f is a nonlinear mapping\nrelationship between the input (condition monitoring data) vi\nand the output (health index HI).\nAmong the AI algorithms, the neural network and its modi-\nﬁed methods [25], [26], as well as the support vector machine\n(SVM) [27] are usually taken as classiﬁers or regressors in the\ncase of a certain number of labeled condition monitoring data\n(with known health index) are available. Such labels (health\nindex), generally, are ﬁrstly determined by the weighted-\nscore-sum based health index through formula (1). Similar\nto ANN or SVM, such labeled data are also essential to\nthe regression-based health index [28], [29]. The goal of\nthis type of health index is to ﬁnd the optimal curve that\ncan ﬁt the relationship between the condition data and the\nhealth index to the greatest extent. Either the ANN/SVM\nmethod or the regression-based method health index relies\nless on expert experience. In contrast, the fuzzy-logic-based\nhealth index mainly depends on the knowledge of human\nexperts [30], [31]. To realize this type of health index, a mem-\nbership function needs to be assigned to each of the condition\ndata according to relevant standards or regulations ﬁrstly,\nafter then the knowledge of human experts is transformed to\na number of fuzzy-logic rules, which can be used for fuzzy\nsynthesis and the ﬁnal health indices are thus derived.\nIn order to get a reliable transformer health index, either\nusing those weighted-score-sum based approaches or AI\nalgorithms, the experience of human experts cannot be\nignored, i.e. the determination of the weights in weighted-\nscore-sum based health index relies on the expertise of human\nexperts, although kinds of feature selection methods are\napplied to reduce the subjectivity. Additionally, label identi-\nﬁcation (a speciﬁc health index) of the transformer condition\ndata also depends on experts’ judgment. Therefore, the results\nof such health indices are subjective in nature as human\nexperience varies from person to person, which signiﬁcantly\naffects the calculated health index as a consequence.\nConfront with such an issue, a probabilistic health index\nbased on Bayesian information fusion is proposed in [33],\nwhere a probabilistic graphical model is constructed and\napplied to infer the relationship between the condition data\nand the health index of a transformer. This probabilistic health\nindex is more objective since it emphasizes on the use of\na variety of different types of transformer condition data,\nincluding the online monitored, the ofﬂine measured, as well\nas the failure statistics. A brief review of this health index will\nbe given below.\nB. REALIZATION OF PROBABILISTIC\nTRANSFORMER HEALTH INDEX\nIn the ﬁeld of data fusion, the graph-based method for infer-\nencing cause-effect relationships like the Bayesian belief net-\nwork (BBN) is widely used [34]. Its probabilistic structure,\nin combination with the fault tree of power transformer [35],\ncan ﬁt the calculation of health index very well. The fault tree\ngiven in [35] deﬁnes the cause-effect relationship between\nthe condition monitoring data and the health status of a\ntransformer’s component is thus referenced for establishing\na four-layer BBN shown in Figure 3.\nOnce a BBN is established and its structure parameters are\nﬁxed, the transformer health index can then be calculable if\na new set of condition monitoring data is available. The main\n9694 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. Liet al.: Probabilistic Health Index-Based Apparent Age Estimation for Power Transformers\nFIGURE 3. BBN implemented for probabilistic health index calculation as\na result of dynamic information fusion.\nprocedures for realizing such a probabilistic health index are\nas follows.\n1) CONSTRUCTION OF THE BBN FOR\nPROBABILISTIC INFERENCE\nFor the constructed four-layer BBN, various condition moni-\ntoring data of power transformer like online monitored DGA,\nofﬂine routine tests, maintenance records, as well as failure\nstatistics can be utilized for determine its structure parame-\nters, i.e., the prior probability of father nodes (the nodes that\narrows start from) and the conditional probability table (CPT)\nfor child nodes (the nodes that arrows pointed) in Figure 3.\nIn this four-layer BBN, each node in the data layer stands\nfor one kind of condition data, the condition of a node in the\nfactor layer is usually decided by several nodes in the data\nlayer. Similarly, the state of an individual component can be\ndetermined by several nodes in the factor layer. The health\nindex of a transformer is a combined result of all components’\ncondition. In the BBN, six components are considered, i.e.\ntransformer winding, core, oil, bushing, tap changer, and the\ncombination of tank and auxiliaries. Note that in data layer,\nthe node ‘‘Dissolved gases’’ represents seven types of gases\ndissolved in oil (H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO, and CO 2),\nwhile the node ‘‘Oil characteristics’’ includes four types of\ntest data, i.e. dielectric strength, acid number, moisture in\noil and dissipation factor. Similarly, the node ‘‘Bushing dis-\nsolved gases’’ indicates four dissolved gases (CH 4, C 2H2,\nC2H4, and C2H6).\n2) DETERMINATION OF THE PRIOR PROBABILITY\nFor each node in the data layer of the BBN in Fig.3, its\ncondition state is categorized into four levels, i.e., Good, Fair,\nPoor, and Faulty. The prior probabilities of these state levels\nof each node are determined according to relevant standards\nand the experience of human experts. Details can refer to [33].\nTABLE 1. Determination of condition state levels – An example.\nTABLE 2. Prior probability from data statistics – An example.\nHence, the ﬁnal form of the heath index from the BBN\nrepresented as the probability of an individual state, which\nis unique from the conventional health index formatted as a\nscore.\nTo illustrate how the condition state level is determined,\nan example is given in Table 1. In the Table, the condition\nstate levels of Data A and Data B are divided into different\nintervals, where ‘‘a1’’, ‘‘b1’’, ‘‘c1’’, ‘‘a2’’, ‘‘b2’’ and ‘‘c2’’\nrepresents limits deﬁned in relevant standards. For example,\nData A usually represents the indices, which are the smaller\nthe better. Namely, when the data value bellows ‘‘a1’’, then it\ncan be categorized as ‘‘Good,’’ while the data locates between\n‘‘a1’’ and ‘‘b1’’, it is then classiﬁed as ‘‘Fair’’, etc. In contrast,\nData B stands for the indices of the bigger, the better. For\nillustration, the condition data of H 2 and DP are given here.\nOnce the condition state level is determined, the statistics\nof available data can then be used for determining the prior\nprobability, as illustrated in Table 2.\nAfter the condition state levels deﬁned in Table 1, the con-\ndition data can be classiﬁed into different groups concerning\neach condition state level. For Data A in Table 2, the sum\nof the prior probability belongs to each state is 1, namely,\nA%+B%+C%+D%=1. For example, the prior probability\nof H 2 that will be used for the case study in Section IV-B,\nis determined according to the collected data of onsite trans-\nformers, which is 88.6% for ‘‘Good’’, 9.8% for ‘‘Fair’’, 1.0%\nfor ‘‘Poor’’ and 0.6% for ‘‘Faulty’’.\n3) DETERMINATION OF CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY TABLE\nHere, a serial relationship between two elements in factor\nlayer (the DGA factor and oil quality factor) and a component\nin component layer (Oil) in Fig.3 is taken as an example to\nillustrate the determination of a CPT. In Fig.3, the condition\nof ‘‘Oil’’ is decided by ‘‘DGA factor (DGAF)’’ and ‘‘Oil\nquality factor (OQF)’’, while the importance of each of them\nto the oil condition is assigned as 40% and 60%, respectively.\nSuch an ‘‘importance degree’’, however, is decided by human\nexperts. Thus, a condition score table is derived in Table 3 to\nshow the transform from condition score to probability.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 9695\nS. Liet al.: Probabilistic Health Index-Based Apparent Age Estimation for Power Transformers\nTABLE 3. Condition score and corresponding probability of ‘‘Oil’’ .\nFIGURE 4. Calculation of the transformer apparent age. (a) Overall\ncondition of a transformer fleet as a function of age, (b) Apparent age\nfrom health condition.\nIn Table 3, when the condition of DGAF is ‘‘Good’’, given\n‘‘Poor’’ to the state of OQF, the calculated condition score is\n2.4 with a weighted-score sum given in [33]. According to\nFig.4, the corresponding probability is [0, 0.655, 0.345, 0].\nNamely, the likelihood of Oil in a ‘‘Fair’’ state is 0.655, in a\n‘‘Poor’’ state is 0.345, and 0 for both ‘‘Good’’ and ‘‘Faulty’’\nstate.\nIn Table 3, when the condition of DGAF is ‘‘Good’’,\ngiven ‘‘Poor’’ to the state of OQF,. it can be calculated that\nthe condition score is 2.4 with a weighted-score sum given\nin [33]. According to Fig.4, the corresponding probability\nis [0, 0.655, 0.345, 0]. Namely, the likelihood of Oil in a\n‘‘Fair’’ state is 0.655, in a ‘‘Poor’’ state is 0.345, and 0 for\nboth ‘‘Good’’ and ‘‘Faulty’’ state.\n4) CALCULATION THE JPD AND DATA FUSION USING BBN\nWith the CPT of each child node determined, the JPD can\nbe readily calculated through (3). Once new condition data\nbecomes available, its health index can be calculated through\nthe above constructed BBN.\nApparently, by applying the BBN, various kinds of data\ncan be integrated by multi-source information fusion. This\nmeans the BBN acts a function F and has the ability to process\nthe transformer data set xi through information fusion within\nit [36]:\nF(xi) =F(e) =\n∑\nU\\{Xi}P(U, e)\nP(e) (3)\nwhere F(xi) is the fusion result based on the evidence e. In this\npaper, e refers to different types of measurement or condition\nmonitoring data of a transformer.\nThe output 2 is the posterior probability of hypotheses that\nneed to be inferred. In this paper, it is the ﬁnal health index,\nwhich can be expressed as :\n2 =P(Xi|e) (4)\nObviously, for traditional approaches, the importance of a\nsingle condition monitoring data to the overall condition of\na transformer is represented by the ‘‘weight’’ assigned by\nhuman experts. While for the BBN, this is delivered by the\nCPTs deﬁned from layer to layer, which are mainly developed\nfrom the statistics of condition monitoring data, test results,\nbut only partially relies on the experience of human experts.\nIt means human experts cannot be ignored in the development\nof CPT for BBN, but their subjectivity can be greatly reduced\nsince the proposed BBN introduces the CPT.\nIII. TRANSFORMER APPARENT AGE\nThe transformer apparent age is a combination of a trans-\nformer’s service age and its health condition, which ﬁrst\noriginated from the need for asset overhaul, retirement,\nreplacement, and investment decision [37]. The apparent age\nis an adjusted value given the condition of all transformers\namong a ﬂeet is known, the process of estimating the trans-\nformer apparent age from the results of health condition is\nillustrated in Figure 4.\nAs an example, the transformer’s health condition\nof 180 units is calculated and drawn in Figure 4a (the blue\ndot). Note that the health condition of the transformer is\ndeﬁned in percentage, e.g., 100% means a transformer in\nan excellent condition while 0% stands for a transformer\nin bad condition. In order to ﬁnd a formula to describe the\ncorrelation between the actual age of transformer and its cor-\nresponding health condition, linear regression was adopted\nand the result can be seen in Figure 4a. The red regression\nline indicating the condition of the entire transformer. Thus,\nthe blue dots below the line means the state of the correspond-\ning transformer is worse than average, and vice versa.\nWith such regression curves available, the transformer\napparent age can be readily determined as shown in Figure 4b.\nThe actual age of either transformer T1 or T2 is all 33 years,\nbut the health condition of T1 is worse than T2 as it is located\nunder the red line in Figure 4b. The arrow line originated from\neither T1 or T2 has a point of intersection with the regression\n9696 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. Liet al.: Probabilistic Health Index-Based Apparent Age Estimation for Power Transformers\nTABLE 4. Basic information for transformers used for case study.\nline, the corresponding value in abscissa is 50 and 21, which\nmeans the apparent ages for T1 and T2 are 50 years and 21\nyears, respectively.\nSometimes, the estimated apparent age may have extreme\nabnormal values like the difference of apparent age and actual\nage is too large, two measures are suggested to avoid that:\n1) disregarding the outliers stand for extreme values in regres-\nsion, and 2) applying the limit values proposed in [37] to\nadjust the ﬁnal apparent age. Such measures can be sum-\nmarized in one, namely, the maximum difference between\nthe apparent age and the actual age should be smaller than\n15 years.\nIV. CASE STUDY AND DISCUSSION\nTo illustrate the proposed transformer apparent age, case\nstudies with both data collected from publications and real\ntransformer condition monitoring data are presented in this\nsection, respectively. Comparison between the apparent age\nestimated from the BBN based probabilistic health index\nand other types of conventional health indices are provided,\nas well as that between different transformer groups is also\nprovided in this section.\nA. CASE STUDY WITH LITERATURE PUBLISHED DATA\nCondition monitoring data of seven transformers [23] are\nadopted to implement the proposed transformer apparent age,\nincluding contents of dissolved gases, oil test results, textual\nmaintenance records, service age, oil temperature proﬁles,\nand records of transformer external stresses are provided.\nEssential information like voltage and power of seven trans-\nformers are given in Table 4.\nConsidering some of the condition data like moisture in\noil, DP, bushing power factor, bushing maintenance records\nof the bushing, OLTC, tank, and auxiliaries are unavailable,\na rough estimate of DP is obtained through (5) with trans-\nformer winding temperature proﬁles provided in [38]. The\ncontent of moisture-in-paper (MIP) is transformed from the\nmoisture equilibrium curves given in [39]. In addition to DP\nand MIP, other missing information that cannot be ignored\nis replaced with statistical results from condition monitor-\ning data of a large number of power transformer. The data\nof 192 transformers in China is adopted for such purpose. For\nthe calculation of DP, this paper uses :\n1\nDP0\n(DP0\nDPt\n−1\n)\n=A ×e\n−EA\nRT ×T (5)\nwhere A is a constant relating to the chemical environment\n(2×108), R is the molar gas constant, T is the absolute\ntemperature in Kelvin, EA the activation energy (111KJ/mol),\nFIGURE 5. Linear regression for health index results. (a) Results of HI\nscore from [23], (b) Results of probabilistic HI of seven transformers,\n(c) Results of probabilistic HI of transformers (exclude the one with the\ninferior condition).\nDP0 and DPt are the initial and the current DP value,\nrespectively.\nTo estimate the proposed apparent age, the probabilistic\nhealth indices of seven transformers were ﬁrstly calculated\nthrough GeNIe [40], the apparent age was then obtained\nfollow the procedures mentioned in Section 3. Details for the\nrealization of the probability health index can refer to [33].\nFor comparative study, the transformer apparent ages were\nalso calculated using a weighted-score-sum based health\nindex proposed in [23]. Calculated results of health index\nand estimated apparent age were summarized in Table 5 and\nshown in Figure 5. The probabilistic health indices with pro-\nposed BBN (Figure 5b, the probability of HI =‘‘Good’’) have\na good agreement with that derived from the weighted-score-\nsum based health index (Figure 5a). When a linear regression\nwas performed for the calculated health index for all trans-\nformers (deﬁned as original, Table 5), the regression equation\nVOLUME 8, 2020 9697\nS. Liet al.: Probabilistic Health Index-Based Apparent Age Estimation for Power Transformers\nTABLE 5. Probabilistic health indices and apparent ages of seven transformers.\nin Figure 5a (above the red line) indicates the initial state of\nthis ﬂeet has an excellent condition, owning a health score\nup to 93.026. The health condition of this ﬂeet deteriorates\nwith a rate of 0.6008/year, along with the service time (actual\nage). In contrast, the regression result in Figure 5b (under the\nblack dash line) shows this ﬂeet initially has a probability\nof 0.6698 in a ‘‘Good’’ condition, which decreases with a\nlikelihood of 0.0072/year against the service time. Besides,\nthe probability health index also shows this ﬂeet initially has\na probability of 0.3158 and 0.0146 in a ‘‘Fair’’ and ‘‘Poor’’\ncondition, and the situation worsens with a rate of 0.0046/year\nand 0.0026/year, respectively.\nConsidering the health condition of transformer T5 is the\nworst among all, a new regression (exclude T5 as an outlier)\nis then conducted. The result is shown in Figure 5a (equation\nunder the red dot line) and Figure 5c. Corresponding apparent\nages are also calculated in Table 5. Table 5 shows that,\nafter adjustment, the sequence for the apparent age of above\nseven transformers estimated from the weighted-score-sum\nbased health index is {T6 > T5> T4> T7> T3> T2> T1}.\nIn contrast, that sequence for the proposed method is\n{T5> T6> T7> T4> T3> T2> T1}.\nObviously, from the perspective of asset prioritization for\noverhaul and replacement purposes, the apparent age is more\npersuasive since the transformer T5 already exhibited with\nthe most unsatisfactory condition. Its apparent age ought\nto be the oldest among all. For transformer T6, based on\nthe result of conventional weighted-score-sum based health\nindex or that from the probabilistic health index, its status is\nbelieved better than transformer T5 since its apparent age is\n58.6 years as estimated. This can be largely attributed to the\nprobabilistic health index used for apparent age estimation\nintegrates different sources of condition monitoring data of\nthe transformer.\nB. CASE STUDY WITH FIELD COLLECTED DATA\nTo further verify the effectiveness of the proposed appar-\nent age, condition monitoring data collected from a group\nof 192 transformers in China are utilized for the case study.\nThe data include dissolved gases, oil characteristic tests, age,\nand failure statistics. The transformer group has 116 trans-\nformers rated at 220kV (with actual age varies from 0 to 35)\nand 76 transformers rated at 330kV (with actual age ranges\nfrom 0 to 65). The calculation result is given in Figure 6.\nIn Figure 6a, the calculated probabilistic health indices of\nall transformers are presented. Considering the probability\nof condition, ‘‘Faulty’’ of almost all transformers is below\n0.001 (except eight transformers with known faults), which\nwas disregarded in the ﬁgure. For the purpose of prioritizing\ntransformers with the highest apparent age to the lowest\nand comparing the overall health condition of two ﬂeets,\nthe apparent ages of these transformers against actual age are\npresented in Figure 6b. In Figure 6b, the linear regression\nresults (solid line) of the relationship between the apparent\nage and actual age are above the dash-dot line y =x repre-\nsenting the apparent age is equal to the actual age.\nFrom Figure 6b, it is evident that the average apparent\nage of this transformer ﬂeet is older than the actual age,\nwhich means these transformers are aged with an accelerated\nspeed. The apparent ages of most transformers are below\n42 years. Whereas some of them even exceed 120 years as the\nactual age of the oldest transformer is only 65 years, which\nindicates that most transformers are working satisfactorily.\nHowever, some of them should be paid close attention and\neven overhaul or replaced.\nOnce separates these transformers by the voltage ratings,\nthe relationship between the apparent age and the actual age\nof the 220/330kV ﬂeets are much different from each other,\nas summarized in (6).\n{\nLapparent =0.9504Lactual +5.0044 (220kV)\nLapparent =1.4122Lactual −14 (330kV) (6)\nwith Lapparent, Lactual represents the apparent age and actual\nage of the transformer, respectively.\nSince the faulty transformers can enlarge the apparent age\nof the transformers, three 220kV transformer and ﬁve 330kV\ntransformers in a faulty condition are screened out, and the\nﬁnal ﬁtted relationships are redrawn in Figure 6d as the\nequations are given below.\n{\nLapparent =1.0496Lactual +3.8727 (220kV)\nLapparent =1.1469Lactual −8.3816 (330kV) (7)\nIt indicates that the transformers of the 220kV ﬂeet are more\nprone to retirement than that of the 330kV ﬂeet, which can\nmainly attribute to the 220kV ﬂeet contains more new trans-\nformers than the 330kV ﬂeet. This can be validated by the\ntransformer statistics provided in Figure 7.\n9698 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. Liet al.: Probabilistic Health Index-Based Apparent Age Estimation for Power Transformers\nFIGURE 6. Apparent age calculated from the probabilistic HI-age.\n(a) Probabilistic HI of all 192 transformers, (b) Apparent age against\nactual age of 192 transformers, (c) Apparent age against actual age\nof 220kV (116 units) and 330kV transformers (76 units), (d) Apparent age\nagainst actual age of 220kV (113 units, excludes 3 units with known\nfaults) and 330kV transformers (71 units, excludes 5 units with known\ndefects).\nAccording to the well-known bath curve, both inadequate\nand faulty specimens fail can result in a high infant mortality\nrate when the new equipment was put into service. When the\nequipment approaches the end of their lifespan or steps into\nFIGURE 7. Quantity of transformers in two fleets. (a) the fleet of 220kV\ntransformers, (b) the fleet of 330kV transformers.\nits twilight years, it can also have an inferior condition due\nto wear out. As shown in Fig.7, the 220kV ﬂeet has 52 units\nbelow ten years (red in Fig.7a), while the 330kV ﬂeet only\nhas 16 units below ten years and ten units above 50 years\n(red in Fig.7b). Such results are thus convincible as it is in\nline with the bath curve.\nFrom the case studies with either literature published data\nor ﬁeld-collected data, it proves that the proposed transformer\napparent age estimation approach is effective and useful for\nprioritizing units among a transformer ﬂeet. The probabilistic\nhealth index based apparent age is not only a reﬂection of the\nreal condition but also helpful for utility retirement, replace-\nment schedule.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe applicability of the proposed apparent age estimation\nmethod for transformers based on the probabilistic health\nindex was implemented in this paper. Different from the\nconventional transformer age or remaining life calculation\napproaches, the apparent age estimation method proposed in\nthis paper used the results of the probabilistic health index as\nits basis through regression. The probabilistic health index\nwas realized as a multi-source information fusion results\nwithin the BBN, with integrated kinds of condition monitor-\ning data of the power transformer. The apparent age, there-\nfore, can be taken as an indication of the ‘‘real service age’’ of\na power transformer. For utility asset managers, the proposed\napparent age can provide a reference for decision making of\nan overhaul, replacement or retirement for power transform-\ners to a certain extent.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nCondition monitoring data of 192 transformers used for\ncase studies in this paper can be downloaded from the link:\nVOLUME 8, 2020 9699\nS.
