T r a n s f o r m e r  o i l  i s  a n  \nimportant medium for the normal operation of transformers, \nplaying a significant role of insulation, cooling, and extinguishing \narcing [1-3]. Unexpected failures at any period in the transformer \nlifecycle have serious consequences. To decide when, what and \nhow to maintain the power apparatus, the strategy of condition \nbased maintenance (CBM) has received widespread recognition \n[4, 5]. Wherein, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) technique is used \nto monitor the dissolved gases in the transformer oil [6].  \nTransformer oil, mainly composed of hydrocarbons, contains \ncarbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms linked by C-C and C-H \nchemical bonds. The chemical bonds are easily broken when \nthermal or electrical faults are stressed over the time. Active H  \natoms and hydrocarbon fragments are rearranged to form small \nmolecular hydrocarbon gases, typically, methane (CH\n4), ethyne \n(C2H2), ethene (C 2H4) ,  a n d  e t h a n e  ( C2H6). According to the \nDuval Triangle Model (IEC 60599), the total accumulated \namount of the key gases (CH\n4, C2H2, and C2H4) can be used to \ndecide the specific fault types according to the ratios associated \nwith each gas [7, 8]. Thus, it is no doubt that the precise detection \nof dissolved gases is the cornerstone of reliable judgement on the \npotential defects in power transformer oil. \nVarious techniques for detection of dissolved gases in \ntransformer oil have been proposed and implemented. Gas \nManuscript received on 1 May 2018, in final form 10 October 2018,  \naccepted 12 October 2018.  Corresponding author:  J. Jiang. \nDOI: 10.1109/TDEI.2018.007535\nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 26, No. 1; February 2019\n153\nIEEE Open Access Paper for IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation.\n \n \nchromatography (GC) method is mostly used as quantitative \nmeasurement in the laboratory and default off-line routine tests [5, \n9]. With regard to online DGA detectors, there are mainly two \ncategories: physical/chemical techniques and optical methods. \nGenerally, physical and chemical gas detectors include thermal \nconductivity detectors (TCD), flame ionization detectors (FID), \nsemiconductor detectors, electrochemical detectors, catalytic \ncombustion detectors, palladium gate FET (field effect transistor) \ndetectors, array gas sensors, etc. [10] The manufacturing \nprocesses of these detectors are relatively mature and the mass  \nproduction costs are low. However, the regular replacement and \ncalibration will increase the workload of operation and \nmaintenance due to the relatively poor long-term stability of \nphysical/chemical detectors. In addition, most physical/chemical \ntechniques rely on the external carrier gases. In recent years, with \nthe development of related technologies, solid oxide fuel cell \nsensors [11], carbon nanotube sensors [12], and nano metal-oxide \nsemiconductor sensors [13] have been proposed and researched. \nPart of the detector performance has been improved. But the \nproblems, such as being susceptible to aging, saturation, \nelectromagnetic compatibility and impurity contamination, have \nto be considered in the future exploration. \nOptical techniques came into the field of DGA owing to their \nsuperiority of non-contact measurement and immunity to \nelectromagnetic interference. Especially, photoacoustic \nspectroscopy (PAS) devices, based on the photoacoustic principle, \nhave been developed and installed [14, 15]. It has been verified \nthat the optical techniques can detect multiple components \nsimultaneously without consuming the fault gases [16, 17]. Gas \nchromatographic columns, which are often used to separate \ndifferent types of gases in physical/chemical occasions, are \nunnecessary in the optical techniques. Nevertheless, PAS is \nsusceptible to many factors, such as noises, incident laser power \nand temperature. Especially, vast noise sources are difficult t o \neliminate and control in the actual application, which can affect \nthe detection sensitivity. Several optical techniques are researched \nas well. Chen et al [18] carried out optical detection of DGA \nbased on laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS). Based on Fourier \ntransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Tang et al [19] utilized \nalgorithms to enhance the measurement. Although the high \nsensitivity had been achieved, the complex and fragile \ncomponents are not suitable to the field application. In addition, \nfiber Bragg gratings (FBG) also has been tried to detect dissolved \nhydrogen [20], but it is inapplicable to hydrocarbon gases due to \nthe lack of corresponding sensing materials. To solve the \nproblems of current optical techniques, tunable diode laser \nabsorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) technique has been proposed \nto complete methane and ethyne detection [21], showing the \nadvantages of real-time detection, high signal-to-noise ratio, high \nreliability, sample-free and non-destructive measurement, etc. \nHowever, only single-component detection is available, it’s hard \nto meet the actual needs [14, 22]. Particularly, the information of \nmultiple components are essential in DGA to diagnose the exact \nstatus of insulation oil. \nIn this paper, based on the TDLAS principle, a multi-gas \n(methane, ethyne, ethene, and ethane) optical detection system \nis proposed and researched. There are mainly three problems \nneed to be analyzed and solved: light source, long path gas cell \nand the topology. To avoid the cross interferences, specific \ncentral wavelengths of different gases are considered and selected \nin the near infrared bands. Long light path is essential to sensitive \ndetection, which is vulnerable to vibration in actual use. This  \nissue is also focused in the manuscript. A time-sharing tropology \nfor multiple gases is put forward to merge the optical path. In the \nlaboratory, each hydrocarbon gas is calibrated. Then the field \napplication and tests have been implemented. \n2 PRINCIPLE OF TDLAS DETECTION  \n2.1 TUNABLE DIODE LASER ABSORPTION \nSPECTROSCOPY TECHNIQUE \nTDLAS technique is an alternative of direct absorption \nspectrum by measuring a high-resolution target spectral region \nwith a tunable sweeping diode laser source. Since ro-vibrational \nabsorption lines of different gases locate at specific spectral  \nbands, the characteristic absorption finger print of a particular \nspecies of interest should be identified. According to the \nLambert-Beer absorption law, the incident/emitted intensity \nvariation is related to the path of the laser beam and \nconcentration of the species in specific wavelength, neglecting \nscattering and reflection process. The quantified expression of  \nlaser output and gas concentration is given by Equation (1) [23]. \n \n0( )= ( ) exp[ ( ) ]I Ic L      ( 1 )  \nwhere \n is wavenumber, which indicates the number of light waves \nper unit length (1 cm)  in the direction of light propagation, \ncm\n-1, 0 ()I   and ()I   are initial intensity and transmitted \nintensity of the laser beam after traversing the medium \nrespectively, mw, \nc  is the number density or the average \nconcentration of absorbing gas, μL/L, L  is the traversing \ndistance of the laser beam in the absorbing medium, m and \n()   is the absorption cross-section of the absorbing gas of \ninterest, cm/mol. \nThe exponential term can be seen as the absorbance \ncoefficient of the gas,  , related to the line strength and \nlineshape function at the specific temperature and pressure, \n \n0\n()=-In( )= ( )()\nI cLI\n   \n ( 2 )  \nDue to the line strength of gas medium is extremely weak \n(10-5 ~ 10-7), the transmitted intensity is calculated as \n 00( )= ( ) exp( ) (1 )II I     ( 3 )  \nSince the light intensity signa l received by the detector is \nmixed with a large amount of background noise signals, it is \nnot conducive to directly measuring the concentration.

Due to the amplitude \nof high order of harmonic component, the second harmonic \nsignal (2f) is preferred to be detected and calculated [24]. Th e \nsignal processing was illustrated in Figure 1. When there is no \ngas of interest absorbed in the light path, PD output is \nproportional to the modulated intensity of tunable laser source, \nas shown in Figure 1(a) and (b). Once there exists the gas of \ninterest, the absorption region appears during the PD detection  \ncycle, and the absorption signal is easy to be obtained through  \nlock-in amplifier, as shown in Figure 1(c) and (d).  Since the \noutput intensity of laser is varied with the injected modulatio n \ncurrent, the 2f harmonic signal in Figure 1(e) is actually \nasymmetric around the central position. \n \nFigure 1. Illustration of signal processing through TDLAS, the horizontal axis \nof figure (a) ~ (d) is the wav elength (nm) and the horizontal a xis of figure (e) \nis time (ms). \n2.2  ESTABLISHMENT OF MULTI-GAS SYSTEM \nGenerally, a typical TDLAS hardware system is mainly \ncomposed of light source and its drive unit, gas cell \n(absorption light path), photodetector, control and DAQ \ndevice, as shown in Figure 2. It is relatively mature to utiliz e \nthe TDLAS system to detect industrial gases in various \napplications. However, multip le gases measurement, cross-\ninterference, high sensitivity and vibration of practical \napplication should be taken into consideration, it is not \npossible to apply the similar device to online dissolved gases \ndetection in power transformer directly. \nTo analyze the influence factors of hydrocarbon multi-gas \ndetection system, single co mponent detection and multi-\ncomponent switching part are taken into consideration \nrespectively. For single gas detection, the detection is closel y \nrelated to gas absorption intensity, cross sensitivity and nois e \nlevel. Among them, the absorption intensity is determined by \nabsorption coefficient and light path, depending on the laser \nsource and gas cell ultimately. The mind map and logic \nanalysis is illustrated in Figure 3. To achieve the multiple \ngases detection and improve the measurement effect, there are \nthree problems need to be solved. \n \nFigure 2. Main hardware components in a typical TDLAS system. \n \nFigure 3. Influence factors of hydrocarbon gases detection system. \n(3) Switching topology. Since the individual laser is \nadopted to multiple hydrocarbon gases, output and \ntemperature of each laser source should be controlled \nindependently to avoid mutual interference. Using optical \nswitch or coupler is an approach to merge the multiple fiber \nchannels into one through time-sharing strategy. \n(1) Laser source. In order to improve the selectivity of \nsingle-component gas detection and avoid cross-interference \nof hydrocarbon gases, high-performance and narrow-line-\nwidth laser light sources should be selected. \n(2) Gas cell. To increase the effective absorption of laser \nbeam, design and integration of long optical path gas cell is \ncritical. Meanwhile, different from the laboratory tests on \noptical platform, vibration issue should be considered in the \nreal application. \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 26, No. 1; February 2019\n155\n \n \n3  EXPERIMENTAL SETUP OF TDLAS \nSYSTEM \n3.1 OPTICAL LASERS \nIn the TDLAS system , the laser is not only a light source, \nbut also a guarantee of spectral subdivision. This requires the  \nspectral width of the laser to be much smaller than the width \nof the absorption peak, as shown in Figure 4. Rapid tuning \n(higher than 1kHz) can be adopted to obtain the information of \nthe entire absorption peak. When it comes to the selection of \nlight source, the following issues are considered in this study. \n \nFigure 4. Schematic diagram of absorption line selection. \n(1) Transmission band. Basi c gas absorption bands are \ngenerally located in the mid-infrared (MIR) region. High \ndetection sensitivity can be obtained using mid-infrared lasers. \nHowever, different gases have different absorption peaks, \nmaking the system complicated, expensive, and difficult to \nintegrate. Near-infrared (NIR) lasers can operate at room \ntemperature and can cover various absorption bands, but the \ngas absorption intensity is weak. Long-path absorption cells \nand wavelength-modulation spectroscopy techniques can be \nused to increase detection sensitivity. Therefore, the near-\ninfrared region (defined by the ASTM Working Group on NIR \nas 780 nm to 2526 nm) is preferred in this research. Last but \nnot least, the transmission loss of the fiber is relatively low  in \nNIR, especially optical telecom bands (O band: 1260-1360 nm; \nE band: 1360-1460 nm; S band:1460-1530 nm; C band: 1530-\n1565 nm; L band: 1565-1625 nm; U band: 1625-1675 nm), as \nshown in Figure 5. With the aforementioned consideration, \nabsorption lines in telecom bands are focused in this study. \n(2) Central wavelengths. In the selection of absorption lines, \ntwo factors are mainly considered: one is the intensity of the \nabsorption line, and the other is to avoid mutual interference \nbetween lines of the gases dissolved in the transformer oil. For \nexample, the E-band represents the water peak region, the \nwavelength in this band won’t be selected. As a result, the \nfollowing central wavelengths: 1653.72 nm for methane, \n1530.37 nm for ethyne, 1620.04 nm for ethene and 1679.06 \nnm for ethane, are selected. \n(3) Linewidth. The linewidth of a laser is a parameter to \nindicate the width (typically the full width at half-maximum, \nF W H M )  o f  i t s  o p t i c a l  s p e c t r um. Lasers with very narrow \nlinewidth, implying high degree of monochromaticity, are \npreferred in this application. \n(4) Optical output. Low optical output is unbeneficial to the \nabsorption process. The mW level lasers are used in this case. \n(5) Laser type. DFB (Distributed Feedback Laser) is chosen \ndue to its advantages of better dynamic-single stability, lower  \nnoise operation and smaller volume. \n3.2  MULTI-PASS GAS CELL \nIn the trace gas detection, the light path design of TDLAS \nsystem has a great influence on the system performance. Beer-\nLambert Law indicates that, for a certain gas, the signal \nattenuation caused by gas absorption and gas concentration are \npositively correlated. By increasing the optical path, the \nintensity of the attenuated signal can be effectively increased . \nTherefore, a long optical path gas cell should be established \nfor the high sensitivity.  \nTraditional multiple-reflection long-range gas chambers \nmainly include Herriott cells and White cells. Compared to the \nWhite cell, the Herriott cell consists of only two spherical \nmirrors, and the optical system is relatively simple. The design \nof the long optical path gas chamber can also be realized \nwithin a short distance and its optical path is easy to adjust.  \nAlthough its aperture angle is smaller than that of the White \ncell, it does not make any diff erence since the light source is  \nlaser type in this system. Therefore, Herriott structure is \npreferred in our case. However, when the ambient temperature \nand gas pressure in the cell vary, the spectral width and \namplitude of the to-be-measured  gas will change, resulting in \nO-band E-band S-band C-band L-band U-band\n1260 13601310 1410 1460 1510 1610 16601560\nCH4\nC2H2\nCH4CH4\nC2H4\nC2H6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n17001200\nWavelength (nm)\nLoss (dB/km)\n \nFigure 5.

Jiang et al.: Multi-Gas Detection in Power Transformer Oil Based on Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectrum\n \n \nthe deviation of the measured gas concentration. In addition, \nthe vibration of the cell is inevitable in the field applicatio n. \nThus, it is necessary to design a specialized Herriott cell wit h \nthe consideration of temperature, pressure and vibration. \nTo control the ambient parameters, pressure and \ntemperature sensors are utilized in the Herriott cell. Since th e \nvacuum degassing is an effec tive technique in the oil-gas \nseparation, the pressure in the cell is expected to be lower  \nthan normal atmosphere. Honeywell 19 Vacuum Gage series \nsensor is mounted on the gas cell, which is compatible  \nwith 316 stainless steel. The special Vacuum Gage series \nsensors are specifically designed for applications that can be \nexposed to vacuum. As well, temperature sensor and heating \nbelt are designed around the cell, to maintain a stable \ntemperature. \nTo reduce the influence of vibration, it is essential to keep \nthe optics relatively fixed. In this way, we make the \nphotodetector (PD), collimator and gas cell as a whole through \nmechanical connection. Last but not least, a flexible pipeline is \nused from the cell to the vacuum pump to keep away from the \nvibration. A customized Herriott gas cell was developed in our \nstudy. Long optical path of 10.13 m was achieved within 0.34 \nm mechanical length, as shown in Figure 6. Detail parameters \nof the gas cell are shown in Table 1. \n \nFigure 6.

The TEC is to \nmaintain the temperature stability of laser and the FPGA is to \nprecisely control the laser output and to record the \nmeasurement data. Single gas cell configuration is more \nfavorable since the wavelengths of the four lasers are close to  \neach other. It means that there a re four incident light and one  \noutput light. Thus, an optical coupler or a fiber switch is \nessential to switch the laser channels in sequence to the \nHerriott cell. The results of two optical components are \ncompared in the same condition, as shown in Figure 7. The \nfiber switch is selected since the optical switch scheme has a \nmuch better signal-to-noise (SNR) performance. \n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n1.450\n1.475\n1.500\n1.525\n1.550\n1.575\n1.600\n Optical coupler\n Optical switch\nTime (ms)\n2f signal (V)\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\n2.25\n2.50\n 2f signal (V)\n \nFigure 7.

Mass flow controller (MFC ) \nwas utilized to obtain different  concentration of hydrocarbon \ngases, such as 50, 100, 200, and 500 μL/L. Nitrogen (N\n2) was \nselected as the balance gas since it is chemically stable and has \nno spectral absorption. The mixed gases were pumped into the \nspecialized Herriott gas cell respectively. \nTypically, the 2f signal of the absorption spectrum (CH\n4 as \na n  e x a m p l e )  i s  s h o w n  i n  F i g u r e  9 .

As to the gas detection, the noise \namplitude is controlled at mV level. Accordingly, the \ndetection sensitivity of meth ane and ethyne reaches 1.2 \n158\nJ.

In \nparticular, the sub-ppm level sensitivity for the detection of \nethyne, which is the indicating gas of high intensity discharges, \nhelps to find incipient faults in power transformers.\n \n4.2 FIELD APPLICATION \nOnline dissolved gas analysis based on the proposed optical \nsensing technique was deployed in China Southern Power \nGrid (CSG), Zhaoqing city. The system was installed in # 1 \nmain transformer, Duanzhou 220kV substation, integrated \nw i t h  T D L A S  b a s e d  h y d r o c a r b o n  g a s e s  s e n s i n g  s y s t e m .  A  \nhigh-reliability cable is used to connect to the communication \nmodule. \nTo ensure the reliability and stability of the system, the \noptical module was placed in a compartment with properly \ncontrolled temperature and humi dity. Mechanical structure of \nthe multi-gas detection system was designed and assembled to \ncontrol the oil & gas path, as illustrated in Figure 14. \nAdditionally, a specific software was compiled and combined \nwith the warning information to build an online monitoring \nand fore-warning system. \nOn-line detections of transformer dissolved gases with our \nTDLAS technique based equipment, as shown in Figure 15, \nhave been conducted. A comparison test between developed \nonline DGA device and existed DGA equipment were carried \nout in the same circulating oil path of the main transformer. \nThe field test results of our TDLAS device were compared \nwith the original DGA equipment of the transformer, as shown \nin Table 2. Four hydrocarbon gases and the total hydrocarbons \n(THC) value were listed. \nThe high consistence of the field tests data and the high \nagreement of the TDLSA results to that of the reference DGA  \nmanifests the practicality of our TDLAS based DGA device in \nmonitoring symbol gases concentration of transformer oil in \nthe field. \n \nFigure 14.

Specific  central wavelengths of the \nhydrocarbon gases are analyzed and determined: methane \n(1653.72 nm), ethyne (1530.37 nm), ethene (1620.04 nm) and \nethane (1679.06 nm). Moreover, an optical integrated and \ncustomized Herriott gas cell, with a light path of 10.13 m \n(0.34 m physical length), was designed and developed to \nminimize the vibration effect from the field application. In \naddition, to share the optical path, a time-sharing tropology for \nm u l t i p l e  g a s e s  w a s  p u t  f o r w a r d  w i t h  t h e  h e l p  o f  o p t i c a l  \nswitching. The calibration tests showed that the detection \nsensitivity of methane, ethene and ethane was 1.2 (μL/L)/mV, \n2.0 (μL/L)/mV, and 2.86 (μL/L)/mV, respectively. Particularly, \nthe sensitivity of the critical f ault gas ethyne reached as hig h \nas 0.4 (μL/L)/mV. Furthermore, on-line detection in a 220 kV \nmain power transformer with a developed equipment based on \nTDLAS technique, has been conducted and it showed that the \nerror criteria of the relevant standards was met. Laboratory \ncalibration and field tests have demonstrated the effectiveness  \nof using TDLAS approach to diagnose health conditions for \npower transformers. \nFurther research will be focused on the expansion of more \nfault components and long-term reliability of the online \noptical monitoring system. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was supported in part by Natural Science \nFoundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20170786), National \nNatural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51807088, \n51677070) and the State Key Laboratory of Alternate \nElectrical Power System with  Renewable Energy Sources \n(Grant No. LAPS17012).
