Traditionally, the\nlinguistic comparative method would infer phylogenies qualita-\ntively by comparing related languages on shared traits (Atkinson\nand Gray,2005). Recent computational methods make it possible\nto model the process of evolution explicitly, disclosing both the\nassumptions and the data used for inference (Bowern, 2018).\nBayesian phylogenetic inference is the most popular of these\nmethods. It promises to reconstruct the relationships between\nlanguages in a family— represented in the phylogenetic tree, its\ntopology and the branch lengths— while capturing the uncertainty\nof each of these parameters.\nBayesian phylogenetic inference has been applied to different\nproblems of cultural evolution. As a method in comparative\nlinguistics, Bayesian phylogenetics generates classi ﬁcations of\nentire families or single branches, for which the sub-structure was\npreviously unclear, e.g. the higher-order structure of Indo-\nEuropean (Bouckaert et al.,2012), or Timor-Alor-Pantar (Kaip-\ning and Klamer, 2022). In addition, phylogenetic inference\nexplicitly reveals the dynamics of language evolution concerning\ntechnical innovation (Gray et al., 2009), cultural processes\n(Tehrani, 2020), cognitive processes (Widmer et al., 2017),\nmigration pathways (Grollemund et al., 2015) and changes in\nsubsistence (Sagart et al.,2019). Many ﬁndings stemming from\nphylogenetic inference have profound implications for linguistic\ntheory and the ﬁeld of cultural evolution as a whole. Phyloge-\nnetics has taught us, for instance, that changes in habitat facili-\ntated the expansion of the Bantu family (Grollemund et al.,2015),\nthat grammar evolves faster than the lexicon in Austronesian\nlanguages (Greenhill et al.,2017) and that the Sino-Tibetan lan-\nguage family originated in Northern China around 7200 B.P.\n(Sagart et al., 2019). Conversely, the more wide-ranging the\nimplications of a method, the more critical it becomes that its\nassumptions are well-founded.\nBayesian phylogenetic inference has its roots in evolutionary\nbiology and its model assumptionsﬁt biological evolution but less\nso linguistics. The most obvious example is how (DNA)\nsequences are assumed to change according to continuous-time\nMarkov chains (CTMC). In a CTMC, characters evolve con-\ntinuously, independently changing from one state to another\naccording to random mutation rates. Initially, these models from\nbioinformatics were applied by analogy to infer language trees\nfrom cognates (Gray and Atkinson,2003), that is, words with a\ncommon etymological origin. The transfer also happened with\nother models grounded in biology, such as the coalescent tree\nprior (Chang et al.,2015; Chousou-Polydouri et al.,2016; Rama,\n2018), which is motivated by descent from a common ancestor in\na particular population model.\nMore recently, however, models have been tested or newly\ndeveloped explicitly targeting language evolution. The Dollo-like\nevolution model requires that characters can only be gained once\n(Bouckaert and Robbeets,2017), intuitively matching the evolu-\ntion of cognates. The model of concerted evolution allows for\nparallel changes in several sites, capturing systematic sound\nchanges (Hruschka et al., 2015). Ordinal models (Bouckaert,\n2019) can be used to model the evolution of ordinal characters,\ne.g. the complexity of tonal systems ranging from“no tones” to\n“highly complex tone system”. This is less the case for the overall\nshape of linguistic phylogenies, where systematic linguistics-based\nmodel recommendations are still lacking. There are very few\nrecent tests of existing tree priors (Rama,2018; Ritchie and Ho,\n2019), and various questions have been posed, but not quanti-\ntatively and systematically investigated: Are there other\n(computationally tractable) tree priors that could be derived from\ndemic expansion models, instead of assuming speciation at a\nconstant rate, which would ﬁt better with expanding language\nfamilies (Neureiter et al.,2021)? Are binary trees a good model\nfor language phylogenies (Maurits et al., 2019)? What clock\nmodel would be appropriate for language evolution, given known\neffects of schismogenesis (Atkinson et al.,2008; Bateson 1935)?\nMost importantly, nearly all phylogenetic models applied to\nlanguages assume that evolution is entirely tree-like. If shared\nproperties are found in two languages, they are assumed to have\neither derived from a common ancestor or arisen independently\nin the two branches. This assumption is problematic. In fact, a\nrecent debate has been whether the tree model of language evo-\nlution has merit at all (François, 2015). While the strict tree\nmodel is an oversimpliﬁcation of language history, the phyloge-\nnetic framework of inheritance from a common ancestor is still\nuseful (Jacques and List, 2019). This paper aims to address a\nrecurring criticism of phylogenetic models, the fact hat they do\nnot account for contact. When languages interact, this often leads\nto horizontal transfer or borrowing where languages exchange\nlinguistic material. The most readily recognisable borrowings are\nlexical items (“loanwords”), but borrowing may also involve other\nstructural features from sounds to discourse strategies (Grossman\net al., 2020; Muysken, 2011; Thomason and Kaufman, 1989).\nHorizontal transfer is incompatible with the assumption of a tree\nof independently evolving branches.\nIn the past, most language phylogenies bypassed this issue by\nmarking forms that were known to be borrowed as not related to\ntheir origin form (Bouckaert et al.,2012; Kolipakam et al.,2018).\nCombining linguistic expertise with computational methods of\nborrowing detection ensures that the immediate conclusions\ndrawn from phylogenies are likely to hold. In addition, simulation\nstudies suggest that even a decent amount of borrowings has no\nsigniﬁcant inﬂuence on inferred phylogenies (Greenhill et al.,\n2009). However, these simulations assume a continuous rate of\nsingle borrowings, while it remains open whether concentrated\nborrowing events have a more signiﬁcant impact on the recon-\nstruction, in particular regarding estimated tree heights. More\nimportantly, omitting horizontal transfer in phylogenetic models\nis deeply unsatisfying. Contact plays a substantial role in language\nhistories and their interpretation and is thus a valuable outcome\nof a computational inference in and of itself.\nVarious attempts have been made at making horizontal\ntransfer more transparent and explicit, but none has successfully\nadded borrowing inference to large-scale language phylogenies.\nOutside the domain of phylogenetic inference, statistics such as\nthe Q residuals (Gray et al.,2010), δ scores (Holland et al.,2002),\nand TIGER values (Syrjänen et al.,2021) quantify the amount of\nnon-tree-like signal in language data. In addition, methods like\nNeighborNets (Bryant and Moulton,2002) and splitsTree (Huson\nand Bryant, 2006) visualise to what extent and between what\nlanguages the data conﬂicts with a strict tree assumption.\nThe character-based visualisation method Minimal Lateral\nNetworks (Dagan and Martin,2007) shows which nodes in a tree\nshare material beyond what a backbone tree would imply. In\nlinguistics, the method is suitable for visualising language contact\n(Nelson-Sathi et al.,2011), but with the disadvantage of needing a\npre-existing underlying tree.\nIn terms of phylogenetic methodology, Willems et al. (2016)\npresented a distance-based, non-Bayesian inference method of\nlinguistic phylogenetic networks. Even earlier, Nakhleh et al.\n(2005) introduced “perfect phylogenetic networks”, a character-\nbased method to infer language phylogenies based on a maximum\nparsimony score that is modi ﬁed to include borrowings. In\naddition, Dellert (2019) developed a causal inference method to\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7\n2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|           (2022) 9:205 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7\nadd edges of lexical ﬂow to a pre-existing set of phylogenetic\ntrees. None of these methods, however, is compatible with state-\nof-the-art probabilistic frameworks for phylogenetic inference.\nRecently though, some methods have been suggested in that\ndomain. Kelly and Nicholls (2017) developed a Bayesian phylo-\ngenetic method that allows borrowing in a stochastic Dollo\nmodel. Due to the complexity of the numerical computations,\nhowever, their model is only practically applicable to small trees.\nFurthermore, the horizontal transfer edges are not considered\nindividually, but only in sum of all their possibilities (“integrated\nout”), such that the inferred borrowing events cannot be\ninspected or interpreted.\nThe problem of horizontal transfer is not unique to cultural\nevolution. In biology, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurs in\nbacteria, which recombine by transferring part of the DNA from\none microbe to another. Similar to linguistic borrowing, this\nviolates the assumptions of tree-based phylogenetics. In phylo-\ngenetic models with HGT, a tree still describes the history of the\nsites, but each site can follow a different tree. This idea is similar\nto that of gene-trees within a species-tree in the multispecies\ncoalescent (MSC) model (Heled and Drummond,2009), which\nsolves the problem of genetic polymorphism within species.\nHowever, the MSC does not allow a common ancestor of two\ngenes to be more recent than the most recent common ancestor\nof the corresponding species. Species networks relax this\nassumption by allowing HGT at reticulation events (Wen et al.,\n2016; Zhang et al., 2018). Unfortunately, species networks are\nextremely computationally expensive, making inference infeasible\nfor most language families.\nThe ClonalOrigin model (Didelot et al.,2010) explicitly models\nhorizontal transfer of consecutive DNA segments via conversion\nedges, which connect two branches of the underlying tree or“clonal\nframe”. Due to potentially unsampled intermediate lineages, the\ntransferred DNA segment reaches the receiver lineage with a time\ndelay after branching from the donor lineage. Again, the different\npaths that the DNA segments can take at each conversion edge\ndeﬁne different trees for different segments of DNA. The Clona-\nlOrigin model can jointly infer the clonal frame and the conversion\nedges. An implementation of the model is available in the BEAST 2\npackage Bacter (Vaughan et al.,2017). However, the assumption\nthat consecutive segments are transmitted at each conversion edge\nmakes the model unsuitable for cultural evolution. Lexical features\n— or potentially other cultural traits— do not follow a natural order\nthat would make this assumption plausible.\nThis paper presentscontacTrees, a Bayesian phylogenetic\nmodel to infer the phylogenetic history of a language family and\nhorizontal transfer between its branches.contacTrees builds\non the ClonalOrigin model, with crucial changes to make the\nmodel suitable for linguistic data and with novel MCMC opera-\ntors to improve sampling efﬁciency.\nMethods and data\nThe contacTrees model. Phylogenetic models represent the\nancestry of a language family by a rooted binary time treeT . The\ntree’s leaves represent languages in our data set, and the internal\nnodes represent ancestral languages. Each node has a corre-\nsponding height. For leaves, the height gives the sampling date;\nfor internal nodes, it describes the age of all its descendants’most\nrecent common ancestor. In the contacTrees model, the\nlanguage tree\nT is complemented by a set of horizontal contact\nedges C, representing events in history where one language bor-\nrowed words (or any linguistic traits) from another language.\nThese contact edges relax the assumption that the history of all\nwords needs to follow one shared language tree. A contact edge\nallows words to come from a different ancestor language than the\none proposed by the language tree. Each word by itself still has\nonly one ancestor and still follows a tree (Fig.1), but this word\ntree does not always match the language tree.\nA contact edgec ¼ð l1; l2; tÞ2 C models a contact event at timet\nfrom a donorl1 to a receiverl2. For each contact edgec,al i s to f\nbinary parametersZc deﬁn e sw h i c hw o r d sa r eb o r r o w e da l o n gt h a t\nedge. LetW be the set of all words, with corresponding borrowing\nindicators Zc,w ∈ {0, 1} for every wordw 2 W. Zc,w =1i n d i c a t e s\nthat w is borrowed froml1 into l2 at edgec,w h i l eZc,w =0i n d i c a t e s\nit is not borrowed and— barring other contact edges— it is inherited\nfrom l2’s parent instead. Together, the language treeT , the edgesC\nand the borrowing indicatorsZ.,w deﬁne a word treeτw for wordw,\nwhich deviates from the language treeT whenever Zc,w is 1 (see\nSupplementary Material, Section S1.2, for a detailed explanation of\nhow word trees are computed).\nEach word w 2 W has associated data Xw. We denote the\nwhole data set of all words together byX ¼f Xwjw 2 Wg. The\ncontacTrees likelihood can be computed as a product of\nstandard tree likelihoods over all words inW:\nP X j T ; C; Z; θX\n/C0/C1\n¼\nY\nw2W\nP Xw j τw; θX\n/C0/C1\n; ð1Þ\nwhere θX are all parameters of the tree likelihood, including the\nsubstitution model parameters and branch rates (see Supplemen-\ntary Material, Section S5.2).\nThe contacTrees model de ﬁnes a network prior, a\ncombination of a tree prior P T j θT\n/C0/C1\nand a contact prior\nP C j T ; ΓðÞ :\nP T ; C j θT ; Γ\n/C0/C1\n¼ P C j T ; ΓðÞ P T j θT\n/C0/C1\nð2Þ\nThe tree prior is an appropriate, arbitrary prior on T with\nparameters θT . There is a rich literature on tree priors for\nphylogenetic analysis (Drummond et al., 2005; Stadler et al.,\n2013), and discussions on which ones are appropriate for\nlanguage trees (Rama, 2018). The contact prior is deﬁned by a\nPoisson process along the branches of the treeT:\nP C j T; ΓðÞ ¼ ΓjCje/C0Γ=LjCj ð3Þ\nwhere L is the tree length andΓ is the expected number of edges.\nA derivation of this prior and an alternative contact prior are\npresented in the Supplementary Material, Section S1.1.\nFig. 1 Illustration of a word treeτw (black) within the a language treeT\n(grey). As indicated byZc,w = 1, the word is borrowed at the contact edgec,\ncausing the word tree to deviate from the language tree. For example, the\nMiddle English wordlake was borrowed from Norman Frenchlac, leading to\nmatching form— meaning traits (indicated by blue/red colouring) in English\nand French.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7 ARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|           (2022) 9:205 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7 3\nAt each contact edge c 2 C, an arbitrary subset of words is\nborrowed. The binary indicator variables Zc,w ∈ {0, 1} show\nwhether word w was borrowed atc or not. We model the prior\ndistribution of these word borrowings with a ﬁxed borrowing\nprobability PðZc;w ¼ 1 Þ¼ β, resulting in a product of Bernoulli\ndistributions:\nP Z j C; β\n/C0/C1\n¼\nY\nc2C\nY\nw2W\nβZc;w ð1 /C0 βÞ1/C0Zc;w ¼ β Zkk 0 ð1 /C0 βÞ 1/C0Zkk 0\nð4Þ\nWhile we use the term word to describe a unit of borrowing, it\ncould in reality represent any trait or sequence of traits, as\ndiscussed in the sections“Data” and S3.\nThe full posterior of thecontacTrees model combines the\nlikelihood and priors deﬁned above:\nP T ; C; Z; β; Γ; θX; θT j X\n/C0/C1\n/ P X j T ; C; Z; θX\n/C0/C1\n/C1P Z j C; β\n/C0/C1\n/C1P C j T ; ΓðÞ\nð5Þ\n/C1P T j θT\n/C0/C1\n/C1P β; Γ; θX ; θT\n/C0/C1\n: ð6Þ\nFigure 2 denotes this posterior distribution as a generative process\n(a) and graphically as a Bayesian network using plate notation\n(b).\nInference. We use Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to\ngenerate samples from the posterior distribution. While the\nposterior fully describes the desired behaviour of the model,\nadequate MCMC operators are crucial for ef ﬁcient inference,\nespecially for network approaches where the parameter space is\nexceptionally high-dimensional. We make use of standard\nMCMC operators provided in BEAST 2, adapt implementations\nof existing operators (mainly from the BEAST 2 package Bacter\n(Vaughan et al., 2017)) and implement additional operators\nspeciﬁct ocontacTrees. The added MCMC operators fall into\nthree categories: (1) tree operators, (2) contact edge operators,\nand (3) borrowing operators. In category (1), we created adap-\ntations of standard tree operators (e.g. subtree exchange, subtree\nslide (Drummond et al.,2002; Wilson and Balding,1998), since\nany operator that changes the language tree needs to consider the\neffects that this change might have on existing contact edges. If a\nbranch of the language tree moves, contact edges that are attached\nto this branch might become invalid and need to be adjusted\naccordingly. Contact edge operators leave the language tree\nunchanged, but they can add or remove contact edges, change\ntheir height or change their donor or receiver. A borrowing\noperator leaves the language tree and contact edges unchanged\nbut proposes a new subset of words borrowed at a contact edge.\nHere, we introduce a new type of Gibbs operator that vastly\nimproves the sampling performance over a naive random walk\nMetropolis implementation. For details on the MCMC operators,\nsee Supplementary Material, Section S2.\nSimulation study. We test the implementation of the model and\noperators in a simulation study, following a procedure described\nby Cook et al. (2006). In the simulation study, we demonstrate\nthat the MCMC correctly samples from the posterior distribution\nand we show the effect of borrowing on tree-based phylogenetic\nmodels. The study works in three steps:\n1. Trees, contact edges and parameters are simulated accord-\ning to a pre-deﬁned prior distribution.\n2. Data is simulated according to the previously simulated\nparameters.\n3. Trees, contact edges and parameters are sampled from the\nposterior distribution for the simulated data.\nWe repeat Step 3 with and without contacTrees and\ncompare the performance. This way, we can assess the effect of\nborrowing on a phylogenetic reconstruction in an idealised\nsetting, with ground truth and a clear statistical expectation for\nthe posterior distribution.\nIn each of the 100 simulation runs, we simulate a tree with 25\nlanguages according to a Yule process (Yule,1925). The expected\nnumber of contact edges is 6.0. At every edge, each word can be\nborrowed with probabilityβ = 0.25. Based on the tree, edges and\nother parameters, we simulate 100 words (representing the units\nof borrowing), with 20 sites per word. The sites of each word\nevolve according to a binary CTMC model along their word tree.\nThe evolutionary rate can vary between branches according to a\nlog-normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.3. Priors\non the height of three internal nodes calibrate the clock rate. For\neach of the 100 simulated data sets, we attempt to reconstruct the\nsimulated parameters with thecontacTrees model.\nIn a second setting, we reconstruct the same simulated data\nwith the expected contact edgesΓ set to 0, yielding a conventional\nphylogenetic model that assumes a purely vertical transfer of\ntraits. Then we evaluate whether the 95% credible intervals\ninferred in the reconstruction cover the simulated parameters.\nWhen the model assumptions hold, and the simulation and\nmodel are well-calibrated, the coverage should fall between 91%\nand 99% for 95% of the parameters.\nCase study. Finally, we present a case study on 39 Indo-European\nlanguages from the Celtic, Germanic and Romance branches (we\nwill use the abbreviation CGR for these three clades). These\nlanguages are well documented and widely studied, which allows\nfor a detailed discussion of the plausibility of our results.\nThe Indo-European languages have been subject to many\nphylogenetic studies before (Bouckaert et al.,2012; Chang et al.,\n2015; Gray and Atkinson,2003), most of which were based on the\nIELex database (Dunn,2012). For this study, we took the version\nof IELex published with Chang et al. ( 2015). We collected\nadditional data on Medieval Latin, and we corrected clear coding\nerrors (for details, see Supplementary Material, Section S5.1). The\nFig. 2 ThecontacTrees model.

We exclude the\nloanwords in one of the three runs described below.\nWe use a birth–death skyline model as a tree prior (Stadler\net al., 2013). Together with the contact prior (Eq. ( 3)) and\nborrowing prior (Eq. (4)), this deﬁnes the prior distribution over\nnetworks and word trees within the network. We use an\nuncorrelated relaxed clock model (Drummond et al., 2006),\nwhich we calibrate through the ancient languages in our data set\nand through clade age priors on internal nodes (adapted from\nBouckaert et al. ( 2012); see Supplementary Material, Section\nS5.3). As a substitution model, we use the binary covarion model\n(Tufﬂey and Steel,1998) which demonstrated better performance\nthan alternatives in previous studies (Bouckaert et al.,\n2018, 2012). For the contact prior, we de ﬁne the expected\nnumber of contact edges to be Γ = 0.25 and the borrowing\nprobability β = 0.1. The expected number of contact edges does\nnot reﬂect our true expectations but represents a regularising\nprior to avoid over ﬁtting by adding too many edges. For\ncomparison with conventional phylogenetic methods, we run\nthe analysis in three settings:\n● CT: The contacTrees model with Γ = 0.25, as\ndescribed above.\n● noCT: A conventional phylogenetic set-up (without con-\ntact) by settingΓ = 0.\n● noCT-ﬁltered: A conventional phylogenetic set-up, with\nknown loanwords removed from the data.\nThe ﬁrst two scenarios are identical, apart from the different\ncontact prior and, for efﬁciency, omission of MCMC operators that\nonly affect contact edges, which makes them immediately\ncomparable. However, the noCT scenario is not representative of\nother phylogenetic studies, which often remove loanwords from the\ndata (Gray et al.,2009; Kolipakam et al.,2018) .H e n c ew ea d dt h e\nnoCT-ﬁltered scenario where we replace known loans by constant\n0-strings (i.e. absence of all forms in that meaning class). We detail\nthe MCMC set-up and runtime in the Supplementary Material,\nSection S5.4 and discuss general scalability in Section S4.3.\nThe contacTreesmodel is able to jointly infer the phylogeny\nand the contact edges. We show the corresponding reconstructions\nin the Supplementary Material, Section S5.5. For the discussion of\nour results, we focus on the ability ofcontacTrees to infer\ncontact events. Since it is difﬁcult to visualise and interpret both the\nuncertainty about the tree topology and the contact edges, we report\nthe results of an analysis where weﬁxed the tree topology. Precisely,\nwe infer contact events and node heights conditioned on aﬁxed\ntopology based on the summary tree by Chang et al. (2015), a\nBayesian phylogenetic analysis of the same languages.\nData.T h econtacTreesmodel deﬁnes a general framework that\nallows the phylogenetic tree of a linguistic trait to deviate from the\nlanguage tree. However, the model does not make speci ﬁc\nassumptions about traits and how they change over time. Most\nphylogenetic studies are based on lists of basic vocabulary for\nuniversal, culture-independent concepts such as “MOTHER”,\n“EAT”,o r“SUN”. These word lists, sometimes known as Swadesh\nlists (Swadesh,1955), code traits by meaning class (asform-meaning\ntraits): when two different languages share a cognate— af o r mw i t ha\ncommon etymology— for a meaning, the trait is coded as present\n(“1”), otherwise as absent (“0”). For example, in Table1,G e r m a n\nand Old English share the cognate“*ﬂaisk-” for the meaning class\nM E A T .M u l t i p l ef o r m sm a yb es y n o n y m sa n dr e f e rt ot h es a m e\nmeaning, e.g.*madi- and*keta- in Swedish (Table1), but usually,\nword lists only include the most common form.\nIn this case study, we applycontacTrees to a subset of the\nIELex data (Dunn, 2012) that encodes the presence/absence of\n1419 cognates in 206 meaning classes across 39 languages. The\ncoding of the data has several implications on reconstruction with\ncontacTrees, which we brieﬂy address below.\nSince form-meaning traits are coded according to meaning\nclasses, the model also needs to explain semantic shifts or changes\nin meaning. Cognates move in and out of meaning classes more\neasily than being gained or lost altogether. Hence, semantic shifts\ncan result in homoplasy, parallel innovation in two or more\nlanguages. The Russian xod and Ancient Greek hodós, for\nexample, both derive from the Proto-Indo-European word\n*sodó-, which meant ‘sitting’. In both languages, the meaning\nchanged to ‘walking, journey’independently.\nNext, IELex uses meaning classes as the unit of borrowing. This\nimplies that a loanword replaces all previously used forms for a\ngiven meaning, which is plausible if the data contains only the most\ncommon form. However, it results in the undesirable effect that\nsynonyms are always borrowed or replaced together.\nSynonymy in ancestral states can result in different patterns\ndepending on the synonym selected by the researcher. If different\nsynonyms are selected for closely related languages, this implies\nvery volatile and parallel changes along the language tree.\nContinental Germanic, for example, has three synonymous words\nfor the concept SMALL. In the IELex data, two of them are selected\nfor Old High German exclusively (small, luzzil). At the same time,\nall other Continental Germanic languages— including German, the\nclosest relative of Old High German— are assigned only the third\nsynonym (klein). This phenomenon is comparable to incomplete\nlineage sorting in genomics.contacTreescould mistake parallel\ninnovations or retentions as evidence for borrowing. However,\nparallel semantic change can also be a contact effect, when an\ninnovation through semantic shift is reinforced through contact.\nLanguages may innovate or preserve form-meaning pairs so as to\nmirror the form-meaning pairs of their neighbours. Such processes\nare fundamentally based on copying and imitating (calquing) rather\nthan on transfer of concrete material (Johanson,1992). This can be\nseen in the parallel shift from‘straight, good’to ‘opposite of left’in\nFrench (droite)a n dE n g l i s h(right). In the case of semantic\nborrowings only the meaning is borrowed and placed on an existing\nword. German Maus, for example, acquired the meaning‘small\nmobile manual device that controls functions on a computer\ndisplay’from its English cognate. Such semantic contact effects are\nreﬂected in the inferred contact edges.\nThere are other data coding methods relevant for phylogenetic\nstudies involving language contact, which we discuss in Section S3.\nResults\nSimulation study. The purpose of the simulation study is two-\nfold: to demonstrate that the inference works correctly under the\ncontacTrees model and to reveal potential errors when using\nconventional phylogenetic models on data that contains unde-\ntected traces of borrowing.\nTable 1 Three cognate classes of the meaning class MEAT in\nfour sample languages.\nMEAT-1 MEAT-2 MEAT-3 ...\n*madi- *keta- * ﬂaisk-\nEnglish 1 0 0\nGerman 0 0 1\nOld English 0 0 1\nSwedish 1 1 0\n...\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7 ARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|           (2022) 9:205 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7 5\nFigure 3 shows the simulated parameters ( x-axes) and the\nreconstructed mean values and 95% credible intervals (y-axes). In\na well-calibrated model, the credible intervals should reﬂect the\ntrue uncertainty about the parameters and contain the true value\nin 91–99 out of the 100 simulation runs.\nWhen using contacTrees for the reconstruction, 94 runs\ncontain the simulated values for the root height, and 93 contain\nthose for the clock rate, which is within the expected range (Fig.\n4). Furthermore, the root height and clock rate estimates are\nunbiased. Figure S4 in the Supplementary Material shows the\nconsistency of contacTrees-speciﬁc parameters: the number\nof contact edges, the number of borrowed words, the expected\ncontact edges (Γ) and the borrowing probability (β). Without\ncontacTrees, only 84 runs contain the simulated values for\nroot height, and 89 contain those for the clock rate, which is\noutside the expected range. The errors are biased towards lower\nroot heights and higher clock rates (Fig.4).\nFinally, we also compared the potential for errors in the tree\ntopology. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the RNNI distance\n(Collienne and Gavryushkin,2021) to the simulated tree. In both\nscenarios, some errors are possible, but withoutcontacTrees\nthe expected distance is 2.35, while with contacTrees it\nreduces to 1.64. Of course, the exact results of this comparison\ndepend on the simulation settings. The errors are ampliﬁed when\nincreasing the expected values forΓ and β. However, we aimed for\na plausible setting, and we would not expect severe topological\nerrors as a consequence of borrowing as also discussed in Bowern\n(2018) and Greenhill et al. (2009).\nCase study . In our analysis of the Celtic, Germanic and\nRomance languages, we compare a conventional phylogenetic\nreconstruction to a reconstruction with contacTrees .W e\nare mainly interested in three questions: (1) Does the use of\ncontacTrees affect the reconstructed language tree and\nmodel parameters? (2) Does the data support the use of\ncontacTrees ?( 3 )D o e scontacTrees recover known or\nplausible contact events and loanwords?\nWhen comparing the resulting language trees, we see that their\ntopologies mostly agree (see Supplementary Material, Section\nS5.5), but the CT tree is signiﬁcantly younger. The posterior\ndistribution of the tree height (Fig.5b) and the clock rate (Fig.5c)\nare clearly lower according to the CT model, which is not\nsurprising. In a conventional phylogenetic model, borrowings\nhave to be explained by parallel innovations of words, which can\neither be reﬂected in more changes per time unit, and thus a\nhigher clock rate, or in longer time to explain the changes, thus a\nhigher tree. Which of the two is re\nﬂected in the posterior\ndistribution depends on the calibrations. Speciﬁcally, it depends\non whether borrowings similarly affect the parts of the tree below\nand above calibration points.The parameters of the model suggest\nthat without CT, the covarion needs to give room for more\nvariable substitution rates, withα ≈ 0.044 for the CT model and a\nmuch lowerα ≈ 0.006 for the noCT model. Furthermore, a higher\nswitch rate washes out the difference between hot and cold states\nin the CT model.\nWe computed a Bayes factor (BF) to conﬁrm that modelling\ncontact improves the model ﬁt and better explains the dataX.\nThe BF is the ratio between the marginal likelihood of two\nmodels or hypotheses. Speci ﬁcally, we want to compare the\nmarginal likelihood of a model without contact (jCj¼ 0) and\none with contact (jCj > 0). Since both hypotheses are part of\nthe same parameter space explored by the MCMC in CT, we\nFig. 3 Simulated values (x-axes) and reconstructed credible intervals (y-axes) of the root height and clock rate.Reconstructions are based on a\nconventional phylogenetic model without contact (noCT) (left) or on thecontacTrees model (CT) (right).

(7) from samples of the prior\nand the posterior distribution in the CT model. We obtain an\ninﬁnite Bayes factor when using the raw counts as a\nmaximum-likelihood estimate of the probabilities since all\nposterior samples contained at least one contact edge.

While there is no exact ground truth\nfor loanwords, we can use the words marked as loans in the data\nset to evaluate the model ’s ability to predict borrowings.\nUnfortunately, this reference is likely incomplete, as we will\ndiscuss later. For a given threshold /C22kloan 2½ 0; 1/C138, we mark a\nloanword as predicted in a language if in at least/C22kloan of the\nposterior samples, any of its ancestor branches borrowed it.\nVarying this threshold, we can achieve different trade-offs\nbetween the true-positive rate (TPR) and the false-positive rate\n(FPR). Figure6 shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\ncurve for the obtained TPR and FPR values. For example,\nmarking every word as borrowed if it appears in a third of the\nposterior samples would correctly recover 67.9% of the known\nloanwords in the English data. At the same time, only 27.2% of\nthe non-loanwords (including words that are actually loans, but\nnot marked as such) would be marked as loans (blue label in Fig.\n6). In the Supplementary Material, Section S5.6, we included a list\nof the most signi ﬁcant false positives (posterior probability\nof >80% to be a loanword, but not marked as such in the data set)\nand false negatives (posterior probability of <20% to be a\nloanword, but marked as one in the data set). The inferred\ncontact events correspond to multiple borrowings between two\nlanguages. There is no comparable reference to evaluate them, but\nwe will discuss each contact event and its historical plausibility in\nthe next section and the Supplementary Material.\nThe contacTrees reconstruction of the Celtic, Germanic\nand Romance languages shows 32 contact edges. Figure5a gives\nan overview of all the edges in the tree. Each edge is visualised\nwith its corresponding loanwords in the Supplementary Material\n2. Among the 32 total edges, only two connect different top-level\nclades (Gallo-Romance > English, Romance > Brittonic). Within\nclades there are 14 contact edges in the Germanic, 15 in the\nRomance and 1 in the Celtic branch. The contact edge in the\nCeltic branch shows the inﬂuence of Scots Gaelic on Welsh. The\nGermanic contact edges fall into three categories. Two edges\nrepresent the inﬂuence of Norse speakers on the English language\nand one shows an English inﬂuence on the Low Franconian\nlanguages. Eleven edges connect proximate languages within\ncontinental Germanic. In the Romance clade, nine edges indicate\na broad inﬂuence of Latin and Sardinian on other Romance\nlanguages. Most of the remaining contact edges fall between\nclosely related and geographically proximate languages (e.g.\nLadin > Romansh, Provencal > Catalan). Exceptions are the edges\nWalloon > Friulian, French > Sardinian and Ladin > Sardinian_N.\nWe discuss the historical plausibility of these edges and explain\nwhat the reconstructions are based on in the section “Recon-\nstructed contact events”.\nDiscussion\nIn Section“Methods and data” we introducedcontacTrees,a\nnew model to incorporate language contact and borrowing in\nlinguistic phylogenies. We provide an implementation of the\nmodel in BEAST 2 (Bouckaert et al.,2019)( https://github.com/\nNicoNeureiter/contacTrees). Based on the simulation study, we\nargue that the model can faithfully reconstruct simulated bor-\nrowing events and resolve biases arising from borrowing in the\nphylogenetic reconstruction. In the case study, we demonstrated\nthat (1) contact edges improve the statisticalﬁt of the data and (2)\nthe reconstructed contact edges and borrowings include known\ncontact events and loanwords within the Indo-European lan-\nguages. We discuss theseﬁndings, offer additional reﬂections on\nthe suitability of the data set, and give an outlook on future\nresearch in the remainder of this section.\nPhylogenetic reconstructions with contacTrees. In the\nphylogenetic reconstruction of the Celtic, Germanic, and\nRomance (CGR) languages, we see that the inclusion of contact in\nthe model signiﬁcantly impacts the reconstruction. The recon-\nstructed tree is younger, has a lower clock rate (see Fig.5) and the\nFig. 6 The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparing known and predicted loanwords.The curve shows all possible trade-offs between\nthe true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) under varying posterior probability thresholds. The labelled points are the FPR and TPRfor a\nposterior probability threshold of 0.33.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7\n8 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|           (2022) 9:205 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7\ninferred frequency of the ‘present’ state is much lower. This\nmeans that the effective transition rate from 0 to 1 is very low\nand, hence, the character evolution is closer to a Dollo process.\nThis conﬁrms the intuition that borrowing is one type of violation\nof the Dollo assumption (i.e. a source of multiple innovations).\nThe lower clock rate is expected as well, since borrowed words\nhave to be explained by additional changes in a strict tree model.\nThe simulation study shows that undetected borrowings can\naffect the tree height when using a conventional phylogenetic\nmodel. However, in the simulation, the bias was towardsyounger\ntrees, while in the IE case study, conventional models returnolder\ntrees. In the Supplementary Material, Section S4.2, we explain\nthat the direction of bias depends on the relative position of\ncontact edges to calibration points on the tree. In that sense, the\nreconstruction of the CGR phylogeny without contacTrees\noverestimated the root height due to undetected loanwords. Using\ncontacTrees, we can reduce this bias. A similar effect was\nreported in Kelly (2016), where a stochastic Dollo model with\nlateral transfer was applied on the CGR languages, and the\nauthors observed a similar reduction in the tree height. Previous\nphylogenetic estimates of the age of the CGR clades range from\nabout 4200 (Chang et al.,2015) to about 5700 (Bouckaert et al.,\n2012). In contrast to our analyses, these estimates beneﬁt from\nthe larger context of the whole Indo-European language family to\ninform the height of the CGR root. While the two estimates\ncorrespond to very different hypotheses on the expansion of the\nIndo-European languages, both of them are more compatible\nwith the estimate of 5384.0 years before present obtained in the\nCT analysis, as opposed to the 7206.2 years before present\nobtained in the noCT analysis (Fig. 5). The age of the Indo-\nEuropean languages is highly debated. It would be interesting to\napply contacTrees in a case study on all Indo-European\nlanguages to see how our results for the CGR languages translate\nto the whole language family.\nUnsurprisingly, the clock rate is signiﬁcantly lower in the CT\nreconstruction compared to noCT and noCT- ﬁltered. In a\nstrict tree model, loanwords need to be explained by multiple\nparallel innovations and poten tially a loss of the previously\nused word, driving up the clock rate. In the noCT- ﬁltered\nanalysis, removing known borrowings reduces this effect but\nlikely misses some loanwords or parallel semantic shifts, as\ndiscussed below. A lower rate of change and more consistent\nabsence –presence patterns across the word trees lead to a\nhigher likelihood. This higher likelihood comes at the cost of\nadditional model parameters, the contact edges and borrowing\nindicator variables, bearing the danger of overﬁtting. However,\nthe Bayes factor (1056.24) is still signi ﬁcantly higher when\ncontact is permitted, indicating overwhelming support for the\nCT hypothesis. The BF considers the marginal likelihood,\nwhich integrates over all possible parameter values, conﬁrming\nthat overﬁtting is not an issue.\nReconstructed contact events. The CT reconstruction proposes 32\ncontact edges, all of which are listed and visualised in the Supple-\nmentary Material, Section S5.7. Some edges clearly represent\nimportant historical examples of language contact: Latin inﬂuences\non the Brittonic languages after the invasion of the Roman Empire,\nNorse inﬂuences on English due to Viking settlers in Great Britain\nor Norman inﬂ\nuences on English after the invasion of William the\nConqueror. These major contact events across clades are rare. Most\nreconstructed contact edges represent contact between closely\nrelated languages: Inﬂuences of Swedish on Norwegian, Catalan on\nSpanish, German on Danish and many more. The cross-clade\ncontact events are well supported by known loanwords, while\ncontact between closely related languages is more nuanced.\nThe two examples shown in Fig.7 are the only contact events\nbetween two of the three top-level clades. In both cases Romance\nlanguages entered the British isles. We use these well-studied\ncontact events as a reference for discussing the details\ncontacTrees is able to infer under comparable conditions.\nThe fact that weﬁnd major contact events in the British isles is no\ncoincidence. The British isles are a known area of close language\ncontact involving Celtic, Germanic and Romance languages\n(Dedio et al., 2019). The remaining 30 edges represent contact\nbetween more closely related languages. There are 14 contact\nedges in the Germanic, 15 in the Romance, and 1 in the Celtic\nbranch. We willﬁrst focus on the two cross-clade edges and then\ndiscuss several examples of contact between closely related\nlanguages.\nIn the 11th century CE, William the Conqueror, then Duke of\nNormandy, invaded England and was crowned king. Norman\nFrench was introduced as the language of the elites, causing many\nFrench words to be introduced into English Black (2017). Some of\nthese loanwords also found their way into the core vocabulary: in\nthe IElex data set 11 English words were marked as loans from\nNorman French. The contact edge in Fig. 7a represents the\nborrowings that resulted from the Norman Conquest. Medieval\nNorman French not being included in IElex, the edge identiﬁes its\nclosest relative, an ancestor of French, as the donor language.\nHowever, regarding the timing of the contact event, there is\nuncertainty. The bulk of the probability mass is accurately placed\naround 600–1000 years ago, but there is also minor support\n(about 9%) for a more recent date. We attribute this to words\nwhose borrowed form was lost or not included in Provencal or\nWalloon (e.g.push, turn and round), making a more recent edge\nappear plausible to the model.\nThe seven reconstructed loanwords with the highest support at\nthis edge (Fig. 7a) are mostly in line with previous knowledge.\nThe words lake, animal, count, round, vomit and fruit are all\nknown borrowings from the Gallo-Romance cultural sphere. The\nonly false positive is right (RIGHTSIDE), a case of parallel\ninnovation. In spite ofright belonging to the same cognate class\nas the identiﬁed source word, contacTrees reconstructs a\nborrowing event because two ancient varieties (Old English, the\nclosest relative, and Old High German) feature items from other\ncognate classes. As a consequence,contacTrees assumes that\nthe ancestor ofright was replaced in the prehistory of English and\ninfers its reintroduction by lateral transfer.\nThe Roman Empire expanded over a vast area, including most\nof Europe. From 43 CE on, the Romans conquered parts of Great\nBritain, where they ruled until around 410 CE. Over this period, a\nRomano-British culture developed, inﬂuencing the culture and\nlanguage of the local Celtic people, introducing many Latin\nloanwords to the Brittonic languages. In the IELex data, 10\nBreton, 10 Cornish and 8 Welsh words are marked as borrowings\nfrom Latin. Our reconstruction shows a contact edge from\nRomance languages to Proto-Brittonic around 350 CE (Fig.7b).\nThere is uncertainty regarding the exact placement of the donor\nlanguage, spread between all ancestors of the current Romance\nlanguages at that time. The ancestor of Sardinian is the most\nlikely donor (posterior support of 0.26), while Latin does not\nreceive signiﬁcant support. We attribute this to some shared\nBrittonic and Romance cognates missing from Latin. For\nexample, Welsh_ST and Sardinian_N share the cognates\nmam/mamma for MOTHER and ffrwyth/frutta for FRUIT.

Some are\nmarked loanwords, like the Proto-Brittonic gwɨrð (GREEN)\nwhich was borrowed from Vulgar Latinvirdis. Others are likely\ninherited, but still tell a story that contact effects and parallel\ninnovations can explain. The Proto-Indo-European word\n*h3éh1os (BONE) was retained in Romance and Brittonic (e.g.\nFrench os and Breton as-corn), but was replaced in the much\nmore isolated Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages (e.g. by\ncnáim in Old Irish), including Irish and Scots Gaelic. Persistent\ncontact with Romance may have reinforced the use of the cognate\nin the one branch while the more isolated Goidelic languages\nwere more readily replacing it.\nGiven the well-documented persistent interactions between\nGermanic and Celtic populations since the Middle Ages (Black,\n2017; Jackson, 1953), we expect contacTrees to identify a\ncross-clade edge, which is not the case. We can but speculate\nabout possible reasons. Germanic-Celtic loans are absent from the\nIELex and apparently there is not sufﬁcient support from cases of\nshared retention and parallel innovation either. This leads us to\nsuspect that not every kind of contact leaves the same traces in\nform-meaning data sets.\nWe now turn to the edges within each clade, which we visualise\nin the Supplementary Material, Section S5.7. Two of the Germanic\nedges represent the known historical inﬂuence of Norse speakers on\nthe English language, including multiple known loanwords. The\nolder of the two edges very accuratelyﬁts the Viking settlements in\nnorthern and eastern England around 1000 years before present,\nwhich were the source of most known Norse loanwords in English.\nThe younger edge (Danish > English) seems to be an artefact due to\nNorse loanwords that are not coded in Old English. Eleven edges\nbroadly outline a contact area within the continental Germanic\nlanguages. In these cases, almost all support comes from shared\ninheritance, parallel semantic shift with and without contact and\ncascading loans, e.g. the Romance successor of Latin rotundus\n‘round’spread to most Germanic languages. One edge indicates an\nEnglish inﬂuence on Low Franconian and Frisian. Here, too, the\nrelevant support comes from shared inheritance, (hold), parallel\nshift (right) and multiple loans (river). The contact event in the\nCeltic branch shows the inﬂu e n c eo fG o i d e l i co nW e l s h .W h i l e\nIntra-Celtic contact is well known to have happened at least since\nthe early Middle Ages (Bauer,2015) and contact between Goidelic\nand Welsh ﬁts historical facts, the intra-Celtic edge has support\nprimarily from shared inheritance (EAR) in a common socio-\neconomic and cultural context, conservative coding and multiple\nloans (PERSON).\nIn the Romance clade, we ﬁnd edges that match known or\nlikely language contact. They connect Latin to other Romance\nlanguages due to its continued use in the Catholic church, or very\nclosely related languages (e.g. Ladin > Romansh) and geographi-\ncally proximate ones (e.g. Provencal > Catalan). However,ﬁve of\nthe Romance contact edges have Sardinian as a donor language.\nMost of the loanwords reconstructed at this edge represent shared\ninheritance. We suspect that Sardinian — known to be a very\nconservative language— serves as a proxy for archaic word forms.\nThis shows how the model accommodates for the speciﬁc data\ncoding procedures (e.g. avoiding synonyms, selecting archaic\nforms) as well as processes not explicitly modelled, such as\nparallel semantic shifts.\nTo summarise, the contacTrees model detects parallel\ndevelopments in two branches of the tree. Parallel innovations are\nespecially informative, but the model could also infer contact\nbased on surprisingly many shared retentions (as suggested in the\ncase of Romance > Brittonic). Parallel innovations can either\noccur as contact effects or independent parallel innovations.\nIndependent parallel innovations are not infrequent in form-\nmeaning traits. Especially when a language contains multiple\nforms for a meaning (synonyms), the most common form for this\nmeaning can change easily or coding decisions can vary. This can\nexplain cases where the same form is dominant in two distinct\nlanguages by coincidence. But independent parallel innovations\ncan occur more systematically due to semantic or derivational\ndrift, where the meaning of a word changes into a different, but\nsemantically related meaning. It is not uncommon that a word in\ntwo related languages undergoes the same semantic changes in\nthis way, for example in common metaphors (SEE > KNOW,\netc.). Contact can lead to parallel innovations in multiple ways.\nApart from typical loanwords we might detect more subtle\ncontact effects like semantic loans and latent contact effects.\nFurthermore, when a word is widely borrowed, it might be\nintroduced independently in two languages, due to a borrowing\nfrom a third language.\nWhile independent parallel innovations can be falsely classiﬁed\nas borrowings, we would not expect many such coincidental\nchanges to occur in the same languages at the same time.\nEvidence for a contact edge is based on multiple parallel\ninnovations, which are more plausibly explained by actual\ncontact effects.\nReconstructed contact effects. We have compared the recon-\nstructed borrowings to the annotated loanwords in IELex and\nshown the resulting true positive and false negative rates in ROC\ncurves in Fig. 6. The curves are all clearly above the diagonal,\nwhich indicates that contacTrees can detect known loan-\nwords better than chance.\nHowever, loanwords are only one possible form of borrowing.\nThe type of borrowings that can be detected bycontacTrees\ndepends on the traits used. Since form-meaning traits are coded\nby meaning classes, the reconstructed borrowings can re ﬂect\nborrowed meanings. This can take the form of a semantic loan or\nmore subtle effects. E.g. the usage of a shared cognate could be\nreinforced through contact, turning it into the dominant form for\na meaning (which is what is eventually represented in the data).\nThese semantic contact effects are valid and expected results, but\nthey are dif ﬁcult to detect and consequently not listed as\nloanwords in IELex (or loanword databases like WOLD) and,\nhence, are hard to verify.\nDue to the limited information on each word (only absence/\npresence) provided by form-meaning traits, the model needs to\ninfer contact from a broader pattern across multiple words. For\nexample, a single English word that differs from its Germanic\nrelatives, but shares cognates in Gallo-Romance, could be ascribed\nto coincidental parallel innovation rather than contact. However,\nthe convergent evidence from multiple Gallo-Romance cognates in\nthe English vocabulary can still lead to a convincing proposal of a\ncontact event. As a positive side effect, these statistical reconstruc-\ntions make it possible to detect latent contact effects. When we\nobserve a surprising similarity between two branches, it seems\nsensible to consider contact effects as an explanation, even without\nconcrete evidence for a speciﬁc loanword. For example, the use of a\ncertain form for a meaning could be gradually reinforced under\ncontact with a language that uses a cognate for the same meaning.\nThis is the case in the Goidelic-Welsh edge. In typology, this\ndistributional view on contact effects is more common Bickel\n(2015), Dedio et al. (2019), Ranacher et al. (2021). For example, the\nBalkan languages share many structural features, likely as a result of\ncontact. However, the evidence for contact does not rely on the\nexact reconstruction of a speciﬁc borrowed feature, but rather on\nthe statistical similarity across a range of features. The contact\nevents inferred bycontacTreesa r eb a s e do nt h es a m ep r i n c i p l e ,\nbut add a diachronic model to explain these statistical patterns.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7 ARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|           (2022) 9:205 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01211-7 11\nLinguistic phylogenetic analyses are not always based on form\nmeaning traits. The reconstructed contact effects may be different\nwhen using different linguistic traits. In the Supplementary\nMaterial, Section S3 we describe the possible contact effects for\netymon traits, phonemic transcription traits or typological traits.\nAny of these data types would yield different types of borrowings\nand requires different efforts in data collection and suitable\nmodels of evolution. Form-meaning traits are usually more\nreadily available and established for phylogenetic reconstructions.\nFuture work. The contacTrees model extends existing phy-\nlogenetic models to allow horizontal transfer between languages\nin a very general way. The implementation is compatible with\nmany phylogenetic models available as BEAST 2 packages. This\nmakes a range of future applications possible. The case study\nshows how contacTrees can be used to reconstruct dated\nphylogenies. The relevance of this is more striking when con-\nsidering less studied language families, where the knowledge of\npast interactions and resulting loanwords is limited. Furthermore,\nthe use ofcontacTrees for tree building becomes more rele-\nvant for longer word lists, since words outside the core vocabulary\nare thought to be more prone to borrowing (Pagel et al.,2007).\nAnother outcome of the case study are the reconstructed\ncontact events and loanwords, which are of interest themselves.\nAs discussed, the type of borrowings that will be reconstructed\nand the reliability of the reconstruction depends on the type of\ndata used in the analysis. While form-meaning traits provide the\npotential to infer semantic loans and latent contact effects,\netymon traits or phonemic transcriptions might be more reliable\nat detecting loanwords. We hope for future studies to evaluate the\nquality of the reconstructed contact events and borrowings for\netymon traits, phonemic transcriptions and typological data.\nThe inferred contact edges complement the language tree and\ntogether they provide a more complete picture of the history of\nthe languages, which can be a beneﬁt to downstream applications.\nFor example, ancestral state reconstruction has been used to infer\nstates of linguistic traits in ancestral languages, like grammatical\nfeatures (Carling and Cathcart, 2021) or the size of the\nphonological inventory (Moran et al.,2021). Assuming that these\ntraits can be borrowed in the same way as words, a comparative\nphylogenetic study should allow for contact. The contact events\ninferred from lexical data could be informative for the\ncomparative study of other features, too. The applications even\nextend beyond linguistics: contact between languages can be\nindicative of contact between cultures in general. A broad range\nof studies on cultural evolution (e.g. on political complexity\n(Currie et al.,2010) or marital residence patterns (Fortunato and\nJordan, 2010)) already uses linguistic phylogenies and could\nbeneﬁt from linguistic contact edges to incorporate potential\ncontact effects.\nFinally, further development could go into different priors for\nthe contacTrees model. In particular, assumptions about\nwhich languages are expected to be in contact, could be cast into a\ncontact prior. Since language contact must involve contact\nbetween speakers, we would expect more contact between\ngeographically proximate languages. Using phylogeography to\nestimate historical locations, it would be possible to de ﬁne a\ngeographically informed contact prior, i.e. a prior where the rate\nof contact decreases with geographic distance. Stolz et al. (2021)\nfollowed a similar idea and recently introduced a structured\ncoalescent model for viral reassortment networks. In a similar\nway closely related languages are more likely to be in contact.\nThis would motivate a contact prior that decreases with\nphylogenetic distance. In the results of our case study, we can\nalready observe a tendency of related and proximate languages to\nbe in contact. However, this tendency is arising purely from the\ndata. Multiple contact edges with Afrikaans as a donor language\ndemonstrate that the data cannot always exclude contact that is\ngeographically implausible. Here, a geographically informed\ncontact prior would improve the reconstruction. A different\nextension of the model could allow the borrowing probability (β)\nto vary between features. This will be crucial when mixing\ndifferent types of data— e.g. lexical and typological features— in a\nsingle analysis. But even within the lexicon, there are multiple\nhypotheses about varying borrowability (Pagel et al., 2007). A\nmodel which allows β to vary between features would be a\nsuitable tool to test such hypotheses. The modular implementa-\ntion, the compatibility with existing BEAST 2 packages and the\nopen source availability makecontacTrees readily extendable\nin these directions.\nData availability\nThe data used for the case study is available athttps://github.com/\nNicoNeureiter/contacTrees-IndoEuropean along with instruc-\ntions for how to generate BEAST XMLﬁles and how to run the\nanalysis (archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6563028).\nThe implementation of contacTrees is available at https://\ngithub.com/NicoNeureiter/contacTrees including instructions for\ninstallation and usage (archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/\nzenodo.6563025).\nReceived: 14 January 2022; Accepted: 23 May 2022;\nReferences\nAtkinson QD, Gray RD (2005) Curious parallels and curious connections— phy-\nlogenetic thinking in biology and historical linguistics.
