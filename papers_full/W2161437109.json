While different views of organization are\nexpected and valid, no widely adopted approach exists to harmonize different brain labeling protocols and\nterminologies. Our approach uses the natural organizing framework provided by anatomical structure to correlate\nterminologies commonly used in neuroimaging.\nDescription: The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) Ontology provides a semantic framework for representing\nthe anatomical entities and relationships that constitute the phenotypic organization of the human body. In this\npaper we describe recent enhancements to the neuroanatomical content of the FMA that models cytoarchitectural\nand morphological regions of the cerebral cortex, as well as white matter structure and connectivity. This modeling\neffort is driven by the need to correlate and reconcile the terms used in neuroanatomical labeling protocols. By\nproviding an ontological framework that harmonizes multiple views of neuroanatomical organization, the FMA\nprovides developers with reusable and computable knowledge for a range of biomedical applications.\nConclusions: A requirement for facilitating the integration of basic and clinical neuroscience data from diverse\nsources is a well-structured ontology that can incorporate, organize, and associate neuroanatomical data. We\napplied the ontological framework of the FMA to align the vocabularies used by several human brain atlases, and\nto encode emerging knowledge about structural connectivity in the brain. We highlighted several use cases of\nthese extensions, including ontology reuse, neuroimaging data annotation, and organizing 3D brain models.\nKeywords: Data integration, Neuroanatomy, Neuroscience, Ontology, Brain atlas, Neuroinformatics, Information\nretrieval, mri\nBackground\nLarge-scale human brain imaging initiatives are generat-\ning Big Data to characterize normal and neuropsychi-\natric brain structure and function. The Alzheimer ’s\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, [1]), Human\nConnectome Project (HCP , [2]), NKI-Rockland Sample\n[3], and others provide researchers with unprecedented\naccess to massive amounts of shared neuroimaging data.\nWhile tools and methods are available to support the\nvisualization [4-8], data management [9-13] and analysis\n[14-17] of shared or privately collected neuroimaging\ndata, these tools use different approaches to define, seg-\nment, and label neuroanatomical structures.\nOne important component of research in this domain\ninvolves the development of digital brain atlases, which\nprovide both a template brain and neuroanatomical la-\nbels in a standard coordinate system. Imaging data from\nindividual participants are aligned to the template and\nbrain region labels are propagated over to provide con-\ntext to observed features in the data (e.g., location of ac-\ntivation foci). Atlases (i.e., the brain template and\nanatomical label pair) can be based on manual or auto-\nmatically labeled brain regions that are derived using\nvolume-based or surface-based methods. Each brain\natlas develops, adopts, or refines an anatomical labeling\nprotocol [18-24]. As a result, the labeling protocols used\nto define the boundaries of neuroanatomical regions can\n* Correspondence: nolan.nichols@gmail.com\n1University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nJOURNAL OF\nBIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS\n© 2014 Nichols et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Thus, data annotated with labels from different at-\nlases are difficult to compare based on labels alone.\nPrevious efforts to reconcile terminologies in neuroim-\naging, referred to as the brain atlas concordance problem,\nhave taken both quantitative and qualitative approaches.\nTaking a quantitative, bipartite graph approach, Bohland\net al. demonstrated that different brain atlas labeling\nschemes lack a high degree of spatial concordance when\ncomparing labels that seemingly refer to the same anato-\nmical structure [25]. Qualitative approaches, such as our\nown, organize anatomical labels through synonymy, rela-\ntions, and class hierarchies that provide practical utility\n(e.g., information retrieval and data integration) without\nresolving fine-grained spatial discrepancies. These ap-\nproaches are complementary and both will be necessary in\nidentifying a satisfactory solution to the brain atlas con-\ncordance problem.\nTo improve our symbolic model of the brain atlas con-\ncordance problem the labeling protocols from each brain\natlas need to be made explicit. However, the labeling\nprotocols that define anatomical structure boundaries in\nbrain atlases are generally published in natural language\n(i.e., as a manuscript) and lack the term definitions and\nrelationships provided by a machine-readable ontology\nframework. Neuroimaging data and information encoded\nby these terms cannot be accurately interpreted, com-\npared, correlated and applied across different studies. A\nsimilar standardization issue faces the development of\nwhite matter connectivity atlases [26,27], in which our\nunderstanding of human brain connectivity is rapidly\nevolving. As new white matter analysis methods and la-\nbeling protocols are developed, a proliferation of terms\nto label newly identified structures in white matter at-\nlases will likely occur.\nA robust semantic framework is needed to explicitly\nrepresent the anatomical labels from different atlases\nusing relationships that describe anatomical structure.\nOur goal is to provide such a framework for human\nneuroimaging that will facilitate the integration and\nharmonization of data registered to standard coordinate\nsystems with labels for structures in human brain\natlases.\nApproaches to labeling brain structures\nWe selected brain atlases that are widely used in the hu-\nman brain mapping community and harmonized the\nterms used in each atlas’ labeling scheme with the ana-\ntomical structures modeled in the Foundational Model\nof Anatomy (FMA) Ontology. In this section, we provide\na summary of brain labeling protocols that describe the\nanatomical knowledge and spatial relationships encoded\nin the Talairach Daemon, Desikan-Killiany (i.e., FreeSur-\nfer), and Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) atlases,\nas well as NeuroLex. We conclude with a proposal for\nharmonizing all atlas and NeuroLex terms with classes\nin the FMA ontology.\nTalairach daemon labels\nThe Talairach Daemon (TD) is an information system\nthat provides a mapping between 3D coordinates (i.e.,\nTalairach coordinates) and specific brain structure labels\n[28]. It is a digital representation of the original Talair-\nach atlas [19] that is hierarchically organized into five\nlevels:\n1. Hemisphere\n2. Lobe\n3. Gyrus\n4. Tissue type\n5. Cell type\nFor example, the label“Right Cerebrum.Temporal Lobe.\nInferior Temporal Gyrus.Gray Matter.Brodmann area 20”\nrepresents a number of 3D coordinates in the Brodmann\narea 20 cell-type level, the gray matter tissue-type level\nand so on. While this approach has been broadly applied\nin human brain mapping, there are limitations when nor-\nmalizing patient MRI scans due to natural morphological\ndifferences between individuals.\nDesikan-Killiany atlas\nThe Desikan-Killiany (DK, [29]) atlas is a gyral, surface-\nbased parcellation scheme for labeling anatomical MRI\nscans. The anatomical labeling protocol was manually\napplied to 40 MRI scans to build a template brain with\nlabels for 34 cortical regions of interest (ROI) per hemi-\nsphere. This atlas is packaged with the FreeSurfer MRI\ndata analysis package [30] that provides researchers with\naccess to a variety of image processing tools that in-\ncludes labeling anatomical ROIs with a predefined set of\nterms.\nAutomated anatomical labeling\nThe Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) brain\natlas provides labels for 90 anatomical regions of\ninterest (45 per hemisphere) from a single participant\nusing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [20]. Ana-\ntomical structures (45 per hemisphere) were identified\nin a high-resolution MRI by manually tracing struc-\ntures in each slice of a 3D volume. The AAL Toolbox\nfor the Statistical Parametric Mapping Matlab package\n[17,31] provides researcher s with a method for label-\ning brain regions in their data using the AAL proto-\ncol and corresponding vocabulary.\nNichols et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 2 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\nNIFSTD and NeuroLex\nThe Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) stand-\nard ontologies (NIFSTD) are developed to provide a\nconsistent source of terminology for neuroscience con-\ncepts [32]. NIFSTD is not a brain labeling protocol nor\nis it tied to a particular spatial arrangement of brain re-\ngions, but is a collection of brain region labels and\ninter-relationships. Neurolex also represents a general\nmammalian hierarchy of brain parts, with each struc-\nture assigned a taxon rank at which it is generally con-\nsidered to hold, whereas other ontologies, like the\nFMA, are more species specific. NIFSTD is a formal\nontology constructed through the import of commu-\nnity ontologies with specific extensions for neuro-\nscience, covering the major domains of neuroscience\n[32,33]. For community contributions, NIF maintains\nthe Neurolex lexicon, where each entity within the\nontology is exposed as a wiki page (http://neurolex.org),\nbuilt using the Semantic Media Wiki Platform. Entities\nmigrate from Neurolex into the more formal NIFSTD\nontologies [33].\nAn important feature of the project is to clearly and ex-\nplicitly define all of the terms that are used to describe\ndata (e.g., anatomical terms, techniques, organism names).\nThe NIF gross anatomy module was largely based on the\nNeuroNames hierarchy [34-36], re-coded in the Web\nOntology Language (OWL), but has been extensively\nmodified through contributions to Neurolex. Neurolex\nserves as a community platform where those with minimal\nknowledge of building ontologies can still contribute their\nexpertise. Through programs such as the Neuron Registry\nproject of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinat-\ning Facility (http://incf.org), Neurolex is growing into a\nsignificant knowledge base for neuroscience. However,\nNeuroLex does not currently provide the framework ne-\ncessary to correlate the terms from different brain labeling\nschemes.\nOur approach: the Foundational Model of\nAnatomy ontology\nThe Foundational Model of Anatomy Ontology (FMA) [37]\nis an open source reference ontology for the domain of ana-\ntomy that takes into account, at all biologically salient levels\nof organization, the entities and their spatio-structural rela-\ntions which constitute and form the structural phenotype of\nvertebrates with a special emphasis on the human organism.\nIt is based on a unifying theorythat explicitly defines ana-\ntomy and its content from the structural point of view. In\nparticular, it provides a framework that can incorporate and\naccommodate all entities underthe purview of the anatomy\ndomain.\nThe FMA is implemented as a computable informa-\ntion artifact and is primarily intended for developers of\nterminologies and application ontologies [38] in clinical\nmedicine and biomedical research that require anatom-\nical knowledge. Ontologists primarily value its merits be-\ncause it is both broader and more fine-grained than\nextant anatomy texts or terminologies. For example, the\nFMA models both abstract, high-level concepts and leaf-\nlevel, fine grained concepts such as“Material anatomical\nentity” and “Brodmann area 1 of left postcentral gyrus”,\nrespectively. This approach is not entirely consistent\nwith the tradition-based representation of anatomy that\nclinical practitioners and biomedical researchers are\ntaught in their training. Therefore, the benefits the FMA\noffers to end users are best realized through derived ap-\nplication ontologies [38,39] and biomedical software that\nutilize anatomical knowledge.\nThe principled framework provided by the FMA is\nflexible enough to capture the intended semantics of ter-\nminologies developed for more specific purposes. For\nexample, application ontologies derived from the FMA\n(e.g., RadLex [40,41]) can be used to reconcile prevalent\nviews of anatomy (e.g., radiologists or anatomy teachers)\nwith an ontological representation of biological struc-\nture. Thus, knowledge extracted from the FMA can be\nabstracted to a level that is familiar to individuals in a\ngiven domain. The FMA can also incorporate annota-\ntions on anatomical entities that provide a mapping to\nexternal knowledge sources (e.g., ontologies or brain\natlas terms), as well as a means to correlate between\nmapped terms. A central goal of this paper is to demon-\nstrate how the FMA can be used to harmonize the grow-\ning number of neuroscience terminologies and provide a\nframework and use cases for developing useful biomed-\nical applications.\nConstruction and content\nAuthoring environment\nThe FMA information artifact is implemented in\nFrames using Protégé, an authoring and editing envir-\nonment created by members of the Stanford Biomedical\nInformatics Group [42]. Currently, the master copy of\nthe FMA is stored in a relational MySQL database;\nhowever, many major biomedical ontologies (e.g., those\nin the OBO Foundry [43]) are now developed using\nOWL. OWL is now the standard language for describ-\ning ontologies on the Web, and there are ongoing\nefforts to translate the FMA into OWL. Previous at-\ntempts succeeded in creating a version of the FMA in\nOWL Full [44], and more recently a subset of the FMA\nwas converted into OWL 2 [45]. The migration of the\nentire FMA into OWL 2 would greatly facilitate inte-\ngration and interoperability with external ontologies\nand Semantic Web-related technologies. A strategy for\nthis conversion is in early development, thus outside\nthe scope of this paper; however, even without this\nNichols et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 3 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\nmigration, the current Frames version allows us to rec-\noncile existing neuroanatomy terminologies.\nEnhancing neuroanatomy content in the FMA\nThe neuroanatomical content of the FMA was enhanced\nwith detailed modeling for cerebral hemisphere brain la-\nbeling schemes, cerebral sulci, white matter structures,\nand neural connectivity relationships. These enhance-\nments were designed to support use cases in human\nbrain imaging by incorporating four major terminolo-\ngies, described above, that are widely used for annotating\nneuro-related data (i.e., Talairach, Desikan-Killiany, AAL,\nNeuroLex). Our goal was to augment the FMA with the\nspatio-structural properties needed to represent different\nbrain labeling schemes, while maintaining a single co-\nherent framework. By accommodating different views\nwithin the same framework, we can use the enhanced\nFMA properties to correlate disparate brain labeling\nschemes. In the next section we describe the extension\nin more detail. Note that in this paper we represent\nFMA classes inCourier Newfont and relationships in\nbold italic.\nCerebral hemisphere labeling\nFor a given anatomical labeling protocol, the terms used\nto label or annotate brain structures may refer to neuro-\nanatomical entities at different levels of granularity or\nusing disparate features (e.g., morphological vs. cyto-\narchitectural) to define the boundaries of specific struc-\ntures and their corresponding labels. This means that\nthere may not be a direct or one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the terms from different atlases or terminologies.\nHowever, by mapping these terms to the FMA, the onto-\nlogical structure of the FMA explicitly defines what en-\ntities are represented by the terms and how they correlate\nwith one another according to the properties and spatio-\nstructural relationships established for them in the FMA.\nIn this section we provide a technical overview of how the\nFMA was enhanced to accommodate and correlate differ-\nent brain labeling protocols.\nTo provide a mapping between different terminologies\nwe used Protégé to introduce property slots (e.g., source\nnames and unique identifiers) that link FMA classes to cor-\nresponding annotation terms (Figure 1). The labels used in\neach labeling scheme were manually correlated with a cor-\nresponding FMA term. A list of potential mappings was\nsemi-automatically generated using direct string matching,\nsynonymy mapping, lexical mapping, or by interpreting the\nsymbols and abbreviations used in a given labeling protocol\n(e.g. “R” for “Right”, “ctx” for “cortex”, etc.).\nMapping NeuroLex\nUsing the term matching approach described above, the\nterms from NeuroLex were mapped to a subset of clas-\nses from the FMA that model neuroanatomical know-\nledge. For example, Right frontal lobeis a direct\nstring match between FMA and NeuroLex, Inferior\nhorn of the lateral ventriclein NeuroLex is\nsynonymous with Temporal horn of lateral ventricle in\nthe FMA, and Lateral occipital cortexin Neu-\nroLex is a lexical match to Cortex of lateral occipital\ngyrus in the FMA. The mappings were then manually in-\ncorporated into the FMA by adding specific NeuroLex\nidentifiers to the newly defined NeuroLex_ID property.\nFigure 1Protégé screen capture showing the slots for the different terminologies.In the example, the FMA class Gray matter of right\nsuperior frontal gyrus maps to Talairach and DK (Freesurfer).\nNichols et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 4 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\nMapping Talairach\nTalairach Daemon annotations explicitly represent five\nlevels of partonomy where the level of granularity for\neach neuroanatomical entity is denoted by a period. For\nexample, the Talairach label Right Cerebrum .\nFrontal Lobe .Superior Frontal Gyrus .Gray\nMatter.Brodmann area 6 indicates a set of coordi-\nnates located on Right Brodmann area 6, on the\nRight superior frontal gyrus of the Right\nfrontal lobein the Right cerebral hemisphere.\nThe actual neuroanatomical entity being represented here is\n“Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal gyrus”,w h i c he x -\nists in the FMA and is therefore directly mapped to the cor-\nresponding Talairach term.\nWhere appropriate and necessary in the ontology, we\nadded new classes, properties and relations to complete\nthe mappings between FMA classes and the different an-\nnotation terms [46,47]. This is particularly true for ac-\ncommodating and reconciling different labeling schemes\nfor the cerebral cortex. For example, the Talairach\nterm Right Cerebrum .Frontal Lobe .Superior\nFrontal Gyrus.Gray Matter.Brodmann area 6\nrefers to an area in the gray matter of the right su-\nperior frontal gyrus that overlaps with Brodmann area\n6 .W h e r e a st h eg y r u si ss u b d i v i d e di n t or e g i o n sb a s e d\non topographical surface landmarks, Brodmann areas\nare regions defined on the basis of the underlying\ncytoarchitecture or cellular and laminar organization.\nAlthough both types of regional partitions are in the\nFMA, neither Brodmann area 6 nor the gray matter of\nthe right superior frontal gyrus had been partitioned to\naccount for the overlap. We therefore reconciled both\nmorphological and cytoarchitectural schemes into the\nFMA ontology with the following modeling pattern.\nFirst, we created a class for theGray matter of the\nsuperior frontal gyrus, which overlaps with (i.e.,\nhas_regional_part) Brodmann areas 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11\n(Figure 2). Second, we created a class forBrodmann area\n6 and model overlaps with the gray matter of the precentral,\nthe superior frontal, the middle frontal, the inferior frontal\nand the medial frontal usinghas_regional_partrelations\n(Figure 3).\nGoing back to our Talairach example above, we\nmapped it to the new FMA class called Brodmann\narea 6 of right superior frontal gyruswhich\nis_a Segment of Brodmann area 6and a regional_-\npart_of both Right Brodmann area 6 and Gray\nmatter of right superior frontal gyrus\n(Figure 4). And following the transitivepart_of relation\nof Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal\ngyrus up the FMA part hierarchy reveals that all the\ngranularity levels implicitly encoded in the Talairach\nlabel are explicitly represented in the part hierarchy of\nthe FMA (Figure 5). The latter is the kind of information\nthat the ontology can provide to facilitate automated\nreasoning by any system.\nMapping Desikan-Killiany and AAL\nThe labels used in FreeSurfer with the Desikan-Killiany\n(DK) atlas contain abbreviations and acronyms such as\n“Ctx”, “lh” and “wm” which mean “Cortex”, “Left hemi-\nsphere” and “White matter”, respectively. For example\nthe term “ctx-lh-postcentral” maps to Gray matter of\nleft postcentral gyrus. Many of the terms used\nin DK (e.g. ctx-rh-inferiortemporal) and AAL (e.g. Tem-\nporal_Inferior_Right) are customized and specific only to\ntheir respective projects. Therefore, some semantic inter-\npretation is required to parse the meaning and interoper-\nate with other atlas terminologies. In the FMA we provide\na semantic framework that explicitly declares the intended\nmeanings of the terms used.\nWe identified anatomical entities (i.e., classes) in the\nFMA that most closely correspond to a given brain atlas\nlabel. We then elaborated on the properties associated\nwith each FMA class to provide additional relationships\nthat capture information necessary to correlate with the\nlabels from other brain atlases and NeuroLex (e.g., iden-\ntifiers, preferred names, etc.). From the above examples,\nctx-rh-superiorfrontal from DK is mapped to the FMA\nclass Gray matter of right superior frontal\ngyrus and Frontal_superior_right from AAL to FMA\nclass Right superior frontal gyrus.\nNote that the structural entities represented by the dif-\nferent terms are at various levels of granularity, with\nTalairach, FreeSurfer and AAL at the levels ofBrodmann\na r e a ,g r a ym a t t e ro fc o r t e x,a n dgyrus, respect-\nively. Furthermore a laterality attribute is specified for all\nthree representations as opposed to NeuroLex, which does\nFigure 2A listing of regional parts (i.e., Brodmann Areas) for the gray matter of the superior frontal gyrus.\nNichols et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 5 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\nnot require left/right attributes. However the FMA has\nthe framework to correlate all the entities based on their\nontological definitions and relationships as shown in\nFigure 6. In this example, the Talairach term is mapped to\nthe FMA classBrodmann area 6 of right superior\nfrontal gyrus,a part_of Gray matter of right\nsuperior frontal gyrus, the FMA class referenced\nby DK, which in turn is apart_of the AAL mapped entity\nRight superior frontal gyrus . The non-\nlateralized NeuroLex classes are then mapped viais_a re-\nlation to the lateralized entities represented in the other\nterminologies (e.g.,Right superior frontal gyrus\n(AAL) is_a Superior frontal gyrus(NeuroLex)).\nWhite matter and connectivity relationships\nThere are a growing number of human neuroimaging\ntechniques from the emerging field of connectomics\n[2,48,49] that can describe white matter connectivity at an\nincreasing level of detail. Parallel ontological representa-\ntions are required to capture and accommodate the newly\nderived or updated knowledge models these methods pro-\nvide. This is necessary to establish precise and reliable\nstructural-functional correspondence between disparate\nrepresentations of white matter structures. Using new and\nclassic neuroanatomical knowledge we have enhanced the\nFMA representation of white matter tracts and connectiv-\nity relationships between gray and white matter structures.\nPartonomy of white matter structures\nWe pursued a comprehensive spatio-structural representa-\ntion of white matter tracts, particularly relating to parton-\nomy and connectivity relationships. A good example\naddressed by this approach relates to the common practice\nof using the same term to represent both the entire tract\nand its segments, as in the case of theCorticospinal\ntract. In cases where only a very specific segment of the\ntract is to be identified, the indiscriminate use of a non-\nexclusive term for its annotation can lead to errors and\ninconsistencies, especially when machine-processing is\ninvolved. This can be avoided by properly declaring the\nparts of a structure with unique terms assigned to each\npart and only using the structure specific term for annota-\ntion. Figure 7 illustrates this approach using theCorti-\ncospinal tract(i.e., the complete structure) and all of\nits named segments/parts.\nFigure 3A listing of regional parts (i.e., cortical gyri) that intersect Brodmann Area 6.\nFigure 4Part relationships of Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal gyrus.\nNichols et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 6 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\nGranularity of connectivity relationships\nConnectivity between neuroanatomical entities entails\nrelationships at different levels of granularity. Numerous\nterms have been used inconsistently to establish con-\nnectivity relationships between neurons, between nerve\nfibers or tracts and between gray matter structures.\nIn this paper we proposed and gave definitions to\nspecific connectivity types for different granular entities\n(Table 1).\nAt the neuronal level, a neuron cansynapse_with an-\nother neuron or a muscle fiber or a gland cell. Connect-\nivity is at the subcellular level between the pre-synaptic\nFigure 5Correlation of Talairach label to part relationships of Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal gyrus in the FMA.\nFigure 6An example of how terms from brain atlases and vocabularies (right, yellow) can be correlated by mapping to the\ncorresponding class in the FMA hierarchy.\nNichols et al.

White\nmatter structures at the nerve or tract-level (i.e., collec-\ntion of axons)projects_to and projects_from any region\nof the neuraxis (i.e., a term referring to both brain and\nspinal cord). For example, the Dorsal segment of\nsuperior longitudinal fasciculus(i.e., SLF I)\nprojects_from Brodmann area 6 of superior\nfrontal gyrusand projects_to Brodmann area 5 of\nsuperior parietal lobule. Finally, we created tern-\nary relationship types that model neural connectivity\nbetween any two regions of the neuroaxis connected by\nwhite matter. Gray matter structuresreceives_input_from\nand sends_output_to other gray matter structures, as\nshown in Figure 8 for Putamen.\nThe connectivity relationships we propose capture the es-\nsential levels needed to express how information is commu-\nnicated throughout the brain. However, several other efforts\nare working on the issue of neural connectivity relations.\nFor example, the OBO Relation Ontology [50] proposes re-\nlations such ashas_fasciculating_neuron_projectionand\naxon_synapses_in. As additional relationships are defined,\nthe FMA will provide a framework to accommodate these\nterms for further refinement of connectivity representation.\nCerebral sulci\nAmong immaterial anatomical entities, particular atten-\ntion was directed to anatomical spaces such as the cere-\nbral sulci. Sulci are defined in different contexts,\ndepending on the operational needs of the users. In\nsome labeling protocols, sulci are treated as 1-D lines\nthat serve as boundaries of gyri, whereas in surface-\nbased parcellation models they are spaces or grooves\nthat surround the gyri. The PALS-B12 atlas from Caret\n[51], a significant labeling scheme of widespread utility,\ninvolves the use of sulci to identify and contour“buried”\nFigure 7Regional partition of the corticospinal tract from the\nbrain to the spinal cord.\nTable 1 White matter connectivity terms and definitions\nInnervate A connectivity relation where a neurite of one neuron synapses with a neurite or a region of the soma of another neuron or\na region of a muscle cell or a gland cell.\nSynapse_with A connectivity relation where there is apposition between the presynaptic membrane of a neurite of one neuron and the\npostsynaptic membrane of one or more neurites of another neuron or a region of a muscle cell or a gland cell and some\nform of neurotransmission is evident between them.\nProjects_to A connectivity relation where individual axons comprising a fiber tract originating from one or more brain regions\nsynapse_with neurites or somas of a collection of neurons located in one or more other brain regions.

Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 8 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\ncortex among gyri. Here the term“sulcus” denotes a 3D\nvolume, the segments of gyri located in the furrows. We\ndisambiguated the representation of sulcus by treating it\nas an anatomical space and for the area of the gyrus in\nthe sulcus, we regarded it as an anatomical structure\nthat is part of the gyrus and classified it as sulcal seg-\nment of a gyrus underSegment of gyrus of brain.\nAs shown in Figure 9, the middle frontal gyrus consists\nof several regional parts or segments, one of which is\nSulcal segment of middle frontal gyrusand\nthe rest are parts of the gyrus that are externally visible.\nWith this approach, the entire middle frontal sulcus can\nbe modeled as belonging to two gyri– both the Sulcal\nsegment of middle frontal gyrus and Sulcal segment of\ninferior frontal gyrus.\nUtility and discussion\nExtensions to the neuroanatomical axis of the FMA were\nmotivated by use cases in ontology development, knowledge\nretrieval, and data integration. In this section we describe\nseveral use cases for our work and discuss how reusable and\ncomputable anatomical knowledge captured in the ontology\ncan be utilized to solve real-world problems.\nNeuroanatomical knowledge reuse\nThe FMA is a reference ontology that can be imported into\nother ontologies as a way to reuse curated knowledge about\nanatomy [37]. RadLex [40] is an ontology composed of\nstandard terms for the domain of radiology, including im-\naging observations, characteristics, and techniques, as well\nas diseases, radiology reporting terminology, and anatomy.\nFor anatomy, RadLex incorporates a subset of the FMA\nthat is relevant to the radiological scale of analysis [41].\nRadLex also contains knowledge beyond anatomy that\nenables additional radiology oriented use cases such as hu-\nman brain imaging. For example, a digital brain label can\nindicate the anatomical structure that a set of image coor-\ndinates pertains to in a brain template, whereas RadLex\ncan be used to describe key aspects of a neurological im-\naging examination including modality, technique, visual\nfeatures, anatomy, findings, and pathology. By incorporat-\ning neuroanatomical content from the FMA, RadLex en-\nables rich dataset annotations and provides a means to\ncorrelate and integrate the findings with other external\ndata and studies as discussed in the following section.\nOntological knowledge retrieval\nTo leverage the knowledge we encoded into the FMA\nthe ontology can be accessed using a query engine. For\nthis purpose we used the Query Integrator (QI) as an\nFigure 8Connectivity relationships for the Putamen.\nFigure 9Regional parts of the middle frontal gyrus.Sulcal\nsegment of middle frontal gyrus is the part located in the sulci.\nNichols et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 9 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\nunderlying technology [52] to query the neuroanatom-\nical content of the FMA as represented in OWL-Full.\nThe QI is a Web-based query management and execution\nsystem that enables queries over any Web-accessible data\nor knowledge source (e.g. ontology). The QI supports\nmultiple query languages, including SPARQL [53] for RDF\n[54] data sources. QI queries may be stored for reuse, exe-\ncuted via RESTful Web services, and chained together to\nform query pipelines. This latter capability allows the re-\nsults of ontology queries to be joined with data queries to\nanswer more interesting questions than are possible based\non the data alone.\nDataset annotation and“intelligent” query\nAs reported in Turner et al. [47], the FMA was used to\nannotate a large dataset of task-based functional MRI\n(fMRI) signal activations in subjects with schizophrenia\nand healthy subjects. The activation locations were an-\nnotated with neuroanatomical labels from the Talairach\nDaemon [28,55]. These labels combined cytoarchitec-\ntural labels from one method for labeling brain regions,\nwith morphological terms based on sulci and gyri. The\nFMA was extended to include intersections between\nlabel pairs when regions overlap. For example, within\nareas covered by the label Inferior temporal\ngyrus exist areas covered by the label Brodmann\narea 20. Therefore,part_of the Inferior temporal\ngyrus is part_of Brodmann area 20, andpart_of the\nInferior temporal gyrus is not in Brodmann\narea 20. Conversely, Brodmann area 20 has parts\nthat are in theInferior temporal gyrusand parts\nof Brodmann area 20which are in other gyri. This ex-\ntension of the ontology in conjunction with a reasoning\nengine allowed novel questions to be asked about the\ndata.\n3D anatomical model management\nIn biomedical education and research, 3D surface models\nare useful and commonplace. For example, a researcher\nusing the brain atlases described above may generate\nneuroanatomical surface models from a patient’sM R I ,\nwhere each model is a different brain region. While these\nmodels can be organized using naming conventions or dir-\nectory structures, it may be more meaningful to annotate\nmodels using terms from the FMA. Similar to our work\non annotating tabular datasets, the knowledge in the FMA\ncan be queried and used to reason about which 3D models\nto select and display in a 3D scene. We have developed a\nprototype scene generation system that implements this\nidea and will allow users to create Web-based 3D scenes\nFigure 10Screenshot of the 3D model asset manager component of the scene generator displaying a list of asset sets on the right\nand the selected asset set on the left (AAL - Brain).Scenes are generated from the selected asset set based on queries to the FMA.\nNichols et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics2014, 5:1 Page 10 of 13\nhttp://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/1\nusing the results of queries over the FMA or data sets an-\nnotated with FMA identifiers (Figure 10).\nThe system provides access to several biomedical 3D\nmodel sets, including models generated from the brain\natlases described above (e.g., AAL and DK) and allows\nusers to upload their own models. Scenes can be con-\nstructed by hand or using queries, and queries can be\nshared between users and customized using parameters.\nSince all scenes are rendered using WebGL, they can\neasily be embedded within any website or Web-based\npublication. For example, users of this system can access\nknowledge in the FMA to generate a scene showing all\nportions of the brain with blood supply from the middle\ncerebral artery or all structures connected by a given\nwhite matter tract. Similarly, scenes can be generated to\ndisplay different model sets of the same structures such\nas 3D models of the left hemisphere in the DK\n(Figure 11) and AAL anatomical labeling schemes\n(Figure 12).\nThis tool currently provides users with the ability to\nmanage 3D model sets, query annotated models, and\nvisualize query results as 3D scenes. As this tool matures\nit will also incorporate support for building scenes from\nconnectivity relationships, visualizing the correlation be-\ntween model sets, and displaying volumetric anatomical\nimages. In addition, our tool provides model management\nfeatures that facilitate sharing and reuse of model sets.\nThese tools are also useful in validating and exploring the\nFMA and other terminologies, as well as model sets based\non these. Misalignments, missing structures, and issues\nwith coordinate sets readily become apparent in query-\ndriven scenes and, in many cases, can be remedied from\nwithin the tool and re-exported for use elsewhere. Simi-\nlarly, visualizations can be composed that relate the struc-\ntures defined in different terminologies to one another. As\nmentioned, this system is currently under development;\nwe anticipate publishing and releasing it to the commu-\nnity in the near future. Links to any publications associ-\nated with this tool will be available on the supplementary\nmaterials page (http://purl.org/sig/docs/neurofma-jbs).\nConclusions\nWe demonstrated that the framework provided by the\nFMA ontology can be extended to accommodate and cor-\nrelate the terms used in three human brain labeling\nschemes and NeuroLex. We then used the enhanced FMA\nto highlight use-cases for neuroanatomical knowledge re-\nuse and retrieval. The FMA was found to sufficiently cap-\nture and clarify the relationships between different\nFigure 11A view of the DK left hemisphere parcellation with\nthe left precuneus selected.A link to this scene can be found\nat: http://purl.org/sig/docs/neurofma-jbs.\nFigure 12A view of the AAL left hemisphere labeling with the\nleft superior temporal gyrus selected.A link to this scene can be\nfound at: http://purl.org/sig/docs/neurofma-jbs.\nNichols et al.

An ontology-based standard for anatomical data\nannotation\n2. Queries that can use the ontology to infer\nanatomical relationships in data\n3. Data visualization systems that incorporate\nanatomical knowledge\n4. A “meta-atlas” that harmonizes different brain\nlabeling protocols\n5. A unifying anatomical framework for integrating a\nvariety of biomedical data\nWhile this effort advances state-of-the-art knowledge\nrepresentations of human neuroanatomy, further work is\nneeded to address the brain atlas concordance problem.\nSymbolic representations of anatomical labeling schemes\nalone are not sufficient to model the spatial information\nin brain atlases. Computational frameworks, such as\nproposed by Bohland, et al. [25], provide quantitative\nmeasures of spatial concordance but do not address the\nissue of lexical mappings. A hybrid framework that inte-\ngrates quantitative information with ontologies would\noffer a more comprehensive solution to reconciling\nneuroanatomical labeling schemes. Additionally, the\npurely structural approach taken by the FMA only ac-\ncommodates anatomical descriptors, and the need for\nfunctional divisions of the brain calls for future develop-\nment of a“functional brain labeling ontology”.\nAvailability and requirements\nLatest Release:\nFoundational Model Explorer (Online):\nhttp://sig.biostr.washington.edu/projects/fm/FME\nFrames:\nhttp://sig.biostr.washington.edu/projects/fma/release/\nindex.html\nOWL-Full:\nhttp://sig.biostr.washington.edu/share/downloads/fma/\nFMA_Release/alt/v3.2.1/owl_file/fma_3.2.1_owl_file.zip\nLicensing:\nCreative Commons Attribution 3.0: http://creative-\ncommons.org/licenses/by/3.0\nAbbreviations\nAAL: Automated anatomical labeling; FMA: Foundational model of anatomy;\nfMRI: Functional magnetic resonance imaging; MRI: Magnetic resonance\nimaging; NIF: Neuroscience information framework; NIFSTD: Neuroscience\ninformation framework standard ontology; OBO: Open biomedical\nontologies; QI: Query integrator; RO: Relations ontology; ROI: Region of\ninterest; TD: Talairach daemon.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors report no competing interests with the work described in\nthis manuscript.\nAuthors’ contributions\nBNN provided expertise on brain atlases, extracted connectivity information\nfrom the literature, and coordinated use case efforts.
