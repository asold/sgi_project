    "abstract": "Wikipedia, despite its volunteer-driven nature, stands as a trustworthy repository of information, thanks to its transparent and verifiable processes. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) often use Wikipedia as a source without acknowledging it, creating a disconnect between users and Wikipedia’s rich framework. This poses a triple threat to information literacy, Wikipedia’s vitality, and the potential for dynamic, updated information. This article explores the interplay between representation, accessibility, and LLMs on Wikipedia, highlighting the importance of preserving Wikipedia as a space for access, representation, and ultimately advocacy in an increasingly LLM-dominated information landscape. This article contends that, despite being over two decades old, Wikipedia remains vital not only for knowledge accumulation but also as a sanctuary for the future of knowledge representation, championing representation and accessibility in the age of closed-system LLMs.",
