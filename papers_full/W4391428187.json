INTRODUCTION \nGrapes constitute a significant crop to produce wine, with \nan estimated global production of approximately 77.4 \nmillion metric tonnes [1]. The leading grape -producing \nnations comprise China, Italy, the United States of \nAmerica, France, and Spain [2]. Grape s are the third most \nvaluable horticultural crop grown widely in the \nMediterranean region [3]. Despite their global popularity, \ngrapes are prone to diseases caused by fungi and bacteria, \nwhich can result in up to the maximum economic loss of \n80% [4]. Out o f the different diseases, Grape Black Rot, \nGrape Black Measles, and Isariopsis Leaf Spot are the most \ncommon diseases that significantly affect grape leaves \ncurrently [5,6].  \nGrape Black Measles is caused by fungi namely \nPhaeomoniella  spp. The typical symptoms of this disease \nare rounded, irregular spots that spread across the veins of \nthe leaves. A few leaves affected by this disease can result \nin a severe fungal infection throughout the entire plant, \nemphasizing its severity [7]. Isa riopsis leaf spot, or Grape \nLeaf Blight, is caused by Pseudocerospora Vitis and \ndevelops on leaves. This disease exhibits light brown \nsymptoms initially and dark brown symptoms later, \ndepending on the season [8]. Grape Black Rot is caused by \nGuignardia Bid wellii and grows rapidly during humid and \nearly spring conditions. The disease initially appears as \nblack spots throughout the veins of the leaves and alters the \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

DNA-\nbased serological methods offer improved pathogen \nidentification but are time -consuming and requi re \nspecialized expertise [11]. As the morphological \ncharacteristics of diseased spots can vary considerably, \nthere is a need for more efficient and accurate disease \ndetection methods [12]. Computer vision techniques, \ncoupled with high -resolution sensors, s martphone \nintegration, and deep learning algorithms, have emerged as \na promising approach for disease diagnosis [13,14]. The \nability of Deep learning to extract and analyze complex \npatterns from images makes it well -suited for automated \ndisease detection. This research proposes a deep learning -\nbased method for accurately diagnosing and classifying \ngrape leaf diseases.  \n \nII. RELATED WORKS \n \n         In recent years, various methods have been proposed \nfor detecting diseases in grape leaves. These methods can be \nclassified into two categories: Traditional Machine Learning \nmethods and Deep Learning. \nNitesh et al. presented an approach for grape leaf \ndisease detection using Gray -Level Occurrence Matrix -\nbased features and Support Vector Machine (SVM). This \nmethod transformed the input images into HSV color space \nfor precise feature extraction [15]. Sajj ad et al. proposed \nanother method for grape leaf disease detection using Gray -\nLevel Co -occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run \nLength Matrix (GLRLM), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) \nbased features [16]. A few methods were proposed based on \nsegmenting the d iseased portions of the leaves and then \nprocessing them further for classification. S.M. Jaisakthi et \nal. presented a Grabcut segmentation approach for grape leaf \ndisease detection [17]. GLCM-based features were extracted \nfrom the segmented region for furt her classification. Seyed \net al. employed k-means clustering to segment the region of \ninterest for grape leaf disease detection [18]. Then, feature \nextraction is performed in different color spaces namely \nRGB, HSV, and LAB. SVM was used for classifying the  \ntype of disease. Alishba et al. applied a local contrast haze \nreduction technique to enhance the input grape leaf images \nfor effective disease detection [19]. Color, geometric, and \nLocal Binary Pattern based features were considered for \nclassification using SVM. Another method was proposed by \nShanthakumari et al. for grape leaf disease detection using \nhistogram gradient features and Improvised K -Nearest \nNeighbor (KNN) [20]. Zamani et al. used Principal \nComponent Analysis (PCA) to extract significant features \nfor plant leaf disease detection and these extracted features \nare classified using Random Forest [44].  \nResearchers have increasingly adopted deep learning \n(DL) methods over machine learning (ML) methods based \non manual feature extraction  for grape leaf disease \nclassification, as the latter is limited by small dataset sizes \nand requires more data for accurate classification.  Despite \nthe limited dataset size challenge in DL, data augmentation \ntechniques are available to address this issue. Unlike ML, DL \nautomatically extracts features, eliminating the need for \ndomain expertise in feature selection.  \nMost of the recent works for grape leaf disease \ndetection focus on implementing deep learning techniques, \nincluding pre -trained architectures and transfer learning. \nSome works use deep learning networks for feature \nextraction and traditional machine learning for classification. \nKhaing et al. proposed the use of the VGG16 architecture as \nthe base model for feature extraction in their grape leaf \ndisease classification model [21]. The VGG16 model has a \ndeep network structure, consisting of 16 convolutional layers \nand 3 fully connected layers, which can capture and extract \ncomplex features from the input images. Subsequently, SVM \nwas applied to classify the extracted features into specific \ndisease classes. Similarly, Bhavya et al. also adopted the \nVGG16 architec ture to extract features from grape leaf \nimages [22]. The extracted features were then trained with a \nRandom Forest classifier that can handle multi -class \nclassification tasks with high accuracy.  \nZhaohua et al. presented an ensemble model for grape \nleaf disease using VGG16, MobileNet, and AlexNet [23]. \nPeng et al. proposed another hybrid method for grape leaf \ndisease detection with ResNet50 and ResNet101 as feature \nextractors and SVM for classifica tion [24]. Many other \nstudies have also utilized pre -trained deep learning -based \narchitectures to classify grape leaf diseases. Miaomiao et al. \nproposed a united model using GoogLeNet and ResNet \narchitectures for grape leaf disease detection [25]. The \nUnited Model was employed to classify grape leaves as \nhealthy or diseased, specifically identifying common \ndiseases such as black rot, esca, and isariopsis leaf spot. \nAshokkumar et al. proposed an approach for grape leaf \ndisease detection using Faster Region -based Convolutional \nNeural Network [26]. This approach combined attention -\nbased multilayer convolutional feature creation, object \nidentification, & categorization. Fraiwan et al. presented a \ncomprehensive study for grape leaf disease detection with 11 \ndifferent networks comprising Googlenet, Inception, \nMobileNet, ResNet architectures, etc [27]. The study \nreported DarkNet architecture yielding the maximum \naccuracy when compared to other networks. Atul Kumar et \nal. presented a transfer learning -based approach for grape \nleaf disease detection based on EfficientNet architecture \n[29]. Khaing et al. presented an approach for grape leaf \ndisease detection using the VGG16 network [30].  \nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GAN) were applied \nto generate synthetic images to combat the data imbalance \nissues. Bin et al. presented a GAN -based approach to \ngenerate images of four different grape leaf diseases for \ntraining identification models [28]. Zhe Tang et al. presented \na lightweight approach for grape leaf disease detection using \na channel-wise attention mechanism [31].

Sandy et al. presented a \ntransfer learning approach with Alexnet based on Regions \nwith Convolutional Neural Networks [32]. Sri et al. analyzed \nthe impact of the transfer learning approach with VGG16 and \nVGG19 networks for grape leaf disease detection [33]. \nAnother work was proposed based for grape leaf disease \ndetection based on the VGG network [34]. Xiaoyue et al. \npresented a deep learning -based approach for grape lea f \ndisease detection using the Inception -v1 module, Inception-\nResNet-v2 module, and SE -blocks [35]. Guo et.al \nimplemented data augmentation using both rigid \ntransformation and deep convolutional generative \nadversarial networks for feature extraction .  Modified \nResNet and GoogleNet are employed for classification [45]. \nIn the recent years, Customized CNN are employed for \nplant's environmental concerns by incorporating attention \nnetworks and cross-layer extraction structures [40-43,46]. \nAlthough deep learning models have shown promising \nresults in detecting grape leaf diseases , this research has \nhighlighted some limitations that need to be addressed in the \ncontext of grape leaf disease detection which are tabulated in \nTable 1 . These limitations include class imbalance, \ninadequate class-wise adaptability, and insufficient attention \nto critical leaf features. The proposed work will address these \nresearch gaps, and the following subsection will discuss the \nsteps taken to address these limitations. \n \nA. RESEARCH GAPS AND MOTIVATION \n \nThe following are the research gaps that were observed \nin the existing works related to grape leaf disease detection.  \nPrevious studies have mainly focused on either local or \nglobal feature extraction, which can lead to suboptimal \nperformance in detecting grape leaf diseases. To overcome \nthis issue, it is recommended to use feature fusion \ntechniques. \nThe model architectures proposed in existing research \nare often large and complex, making it difficult to deploy \nthem on low -resource devices. The linear arrangement of \nconvolutional layers in these models can result in intricate \ncomputations and a higher number of trainable parameters, \nlimiting their practical usefulness in real-world applications. \nCNNs are commonly utilized in previous studies due to \ntheir high accuracy in detecting and classifying various plant \ndiseases. However, CNNs may not be suitable for capturing \nglobal contextual information and handling long -range \ndependencies. This limitati on can be particularly \nproblematic in cases where the disease symptoms are subtle \nand require a more comprehensive understanding of the \ncontext. \n \nB. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS \n \nThe following are the research contributions towards the \nproposed work. \nThe proposed network aims to improve the \nclassification of grape leaf diseases by combining features \nfrom two different tracks to extract both global and local \nfeatures. The first track uses a CNN to extract local features \nfrom the input image, while the second track utilizes a \nShuffle Transformer to extract global features. \nThe proposed network incorporates Inception -ResNet \nfor better feature extraction, resulting in reduced \ncomputation. This is achieved by performing feature fusion \nof different feature scale convolutions in parallel with input \nfeatures. \nThe proposed network applies both CBAM and \nCoordinate Attention to capture both spatial and positional \ninformation in the image. Specifically, the CBAM module \ncan capture interdependencies between different feature \nchannels, while the Coordinate Attention can capture \npositional relationships between different features. \nThe Shuffle Transformer track used in the proposed \nnetwork is effective in capturing long-range dependencies in \nimages. By incorporating channel shuffling techniques and \nutilizing both global and local information, it can capture \ncomplex features that may be important for identifying \nsubtle symptoms of grape leaf diseases. \n \nIII. PROPOSED SYSTEM \nThis section presents an overview of the different \nmodules employed in the proposed network. \n \nA. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW \n \nThis section presents an overview of the different \nmodules employed in the proposed network. \n \nThe proposed network ‘GrapeLeafNet’ has two distinct \nfeature extraction tracks for precise classification of grape \nleaf disease detection. The first track consists of a linear  \nCNN integrated with modules like Inception -ResNet block \nand Convolutional Block Attention Mo dule (CBAM). This \ntrack uses Inception -ResNet blocks to achieve an optimal \nbalance between performance and computational efficiency \nby employing filters of various sizes, such as 1x1, and 3x3, \nin parallel within the same layers. CBAM integrates the \nChannel Attention and Spatial Attention mechanisms, \nenabling the network to selectively focus on informative \nchannels and spatial regions of the input feature maps, which \nin turn improves the network's feature representation \ncapability. The second track involves the use of a Shuffle \ntransformer to effectively extract the long -range \ndependencies. The features from the two different tracks \nwere concatenated and subjected to the Coordinate Attention \nmodule to further enhance the feature representation for \nprecise cla ssification. The architecture of the proposed \nnetwork is presented in Figure 1. \n \nB. INCEPTION-RESNET BLOCK \n \nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) generally \nrequire larger convolutional layers to improve feature \nextraction and classification performance. However, \nincreasing the number of layers in the network can lead to \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Conversely, a model designed for \nthe low computational cost may not achieve satisfactory \nclassification accuracy. To address these challenges, the \nInception-ResNet block has been incorporated into the \nbaseline CNN module [36]. The  Inception-ResNet block \nemploys a series of parallel convolutional layers with \ndifferent kernel sizes to extract features at multiple scales \nfrom the input tensor. The outputs of these parallel layers are \nconcatenated along the channel dimension, generatin g a \nhigh-dimensional feature map. Next, a bottleneck layer \nconsisting of 1x1 convolutions reduces the feature map's \ndimensionality. Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the \nInception-ResNet block. \n \nC.

These weights are \nthen employed to highlight the essential channels and \nsuppress the less significant ones by rescaling the channel \nfeatures. \nThe spatial attention module of the CBAM module \nfollows a similar approach to the channel attention module, \nbut it rescales the spatial features rather than the channel \nfeatures. The spatial attention module applies average \npooling and max pooling to the feature maps of each channel \nto determine the spatial attention weights. These weights are \nthen used to rescale the spatial features by emphasizing the \nsignificant spatial locations and reducing the unimportant \nones. By integ rating the channel and spatial a ttention \nmodules, the CBAM module can selectively focus on \nimportant features, resulting in improved performance in \ntasks such as image classification. Figure 3 illustrates the \narchitecture of the CBAM.\n \n \nFigure 4. Architecture of the Shuffle-Transformer block \n \nD. SHUFFLE TRANSFORMER \n \nThe Shuffle Transformer is a convolutional neural \nnetwork (CNN) that employs three modules to learn global \nand local relationships between feature maps in an image \n[38]. The first module is the window -based multi-head self-\nattention module (WMSA), which converts the feature maps \ninto a 2D grid and uses self -attention over the rows and \ncolumns to capture long -range dependencies between \ndifferent parts of the image. The second module is the \nneighbor window connection module (NWC), which \nconnects the feature m aps of neighboring pixels within a \nsmall window to capture local relationships and improve \nperformance while reducing computational complexity. \nFinally, the shuffle window -based multi-head self-attention \nmodule (shuffle-WMSA) is used to shuffle the channels after \napplying self-attention to capture diverse information from \nthe feature maps and improve the network's ability to detect \ncomplex features.  \nThe combination of these three modules allows the \nShuffle Transformer to achieve state-of-the-art performance \nin image classification. By using a combination of global and \nlocal information and leveraging channel shuffling \ntechniques, the Shuffle Transform er is capable of capturing \ncomplex features in images efficiently and accurately. Figure \n4 illustrates the architecture of the Shuffle-Transformer. \n \nE. COORDINATE ATTENTION MECHANISM BLOCK \n \nThe Coordinate Attention Block is a convolutional \nneural network module that attends to features selectively, \nbased on their spatial locations in an image [39]. This is \nachieved by separately applying global pooling along the x \nand y axes to capture the me an and variance of the feature \nmaps along each axis. Specifically, the module computes the \nmean of the feature maps at each position along the x -axis \nand y-axis through global average pooling. These two mean \nvalues are then concatenated and fed into a feed forward \nnetwork to calculate attention weights for each spatial \nlocation. The attention weights are then utilized to rescale the \noriginal feature maps, highlighting the significant locations \nand de-emphasizing the less important ones. The Coordinate \nAttention Block selectively focuses on critical spatial \nlocations in an image, leading to improved performance of \nCNNs in various computer vision tasks, such as object \ndetection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. \nAdditionally, the module requires fewer parameters than \nother attention mechanisms, resulting in computational \nefficiency and ease of implementation in CNN architectures. \nThe following architecture is represented in Figure 5. \n \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

The grape leaf dataset \nis separated into two subsets, healthy and diseased, and \nfurther categorized into three distinct diseases: Black Rot, \nBlack Measles, and Isariopsis leaf spot. Table 1 presents the \nsample images for each class. \n \nB. DATA AUGMENTATION \n \nData augmentation is a technique used to increase \ndataset diversity for leaf disease detection. It creates new \ndata points by applying transformations such as rotations, \nflips, scaling, and changes in brightness and contrast. This \ntechnique can help to balance an imbalanced dataset and \nimprove classifier accuracy. It can also improve the \ngeneralization of the classifier by exposing it to a wider range \nof variations in the appearance of diseased leaves. Overall, \ndata augmentation is useful for improving the accuracy and \nrobustness of the classifier in limited or imbalanced datasets. \nIt can help distinguish between healthy and disea sed leaves \nin real -world scenarios. Data augmentation is done in this \nwork using various techniques to create new data points from \nexisting ones. These techniques include: (1) rotating the \nimage randomly between 0 to 40 degrees, (2) shearing the \nimage randomly between 0 to 0.2, (3) shifting the width of \nthe image randomly between 0 to 0.2, (4) flipping the image \nrandomly horizontally and vertically, (5) adjusting the \nbrightness randomly between 0.5 to 1.5, and (6) applying a \nrandom gaussian blur with sigma values between 0 to 0.8. \nThe dataset was divided into three distinct sets, with the \ntraining set containing 60% of the data, the validation set \ncontaining 20%, and the remaining 20% comprising the test \nset. After the split, augmentation was carried out on both the \ntraining and validation sets. \n \nC. ENVIRONMENTAL SETUP \n \nThe proposed network was developed utilizing \nPyTorch, which is an open-source deep-learning framework. \nThe model employed the Adam optimization technique, with \na learning rate of 0.0001 and weight decay of 0.0001, to \nminimize the loss. The training process was carried out on an \nAzure virtual machine that was equipped with an NVIDIA \nTesla P40 GPU, specifically designed for deep learning \ntasks. \n \nD. EVALUATION METRICS \n \nThe following metrics are evaluated in this context: \nAccuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Specificity, and Area \nUnder Curve (AUC). These parameters are used to determine \nthe quality of a model. Accuracy is a statistical metric that \nmeasures how accurately a predicted value matches its actual \nvalue. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the total \nnumber of positive predictions made by the model. \nSpecificity measures the model's ability to correctly identify \ntrue negative values, and it is calculated as the ratio of true \nnegatives to the total number of negatives. Recall is the ratio \nof true positives to the total number of positive samples in \nthe dataset. The F1 score is a combination of precision and \nrecall and measures the model's ability to identify positive \nsamples. The evaluation metrics are determined using the \nTrue Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), \nand False Negative (FN) values, which are expressed in (1 -\n5) below. Overall, these metrics help in evaluating the \nperformance o f a model and identifying areas for \nimprovement. The area under Receiver Operating \nCharacteristic Curve (ROC) is used to describe the \nprobabilistic variation between recall and False Positive. \n \nAccuracy = \n𝑇𝑝+𝑇𝑛\n𝑇𝑝+𝑇𝑛+𝐹𝑝+𝐹𝑛\n                                                     (1) \n \nPrecision = \n𝑇𝑝\n𝑇𝑝+𝐹𝑝\n                                                                (2) \n \nRecall = \n𝑇𝑝\n𝑇𝑝+𝐹𝑛\n                                                                    (3)  \n \nF1 Score = \n2∗𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛∗𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙\n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙                                                (4) \n \nSpecificity = \n𝑇𝑛\n𝑇𝑛+𝐹𝑝\n                                                             (5) \n \nE. ABLATION STUDIES \n \nAblation studies are used in CNN to analyze the \nimportance of different components by removing or \ndisabling them. This helps to understand their individual \ncontributions to the model's overall performance and identify \nareas for improvement. The proposed model comprises of a \n7-layer CNN as the base model, integrated with several other \nblocks including Inception -ResNet, Convolutional Block \nAttention Module (CBAM), Shuffle Transformer block, and \ncoordinate attention block. Sequential analysis was \nperformed to understand the impact of integrating these \nblocks into the bas eline CNN. Ablation studies were \nconducted on each model to assess the effect of each block \non the network's performance. An experiment was then \nconducted to measure the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 \nscore, and area under the ROC curve for each model \nsequentially, and the results were presented in Table 2. \n \n1) Analysis of the 7-layer linear CNN \n \nThe performance of the baseline 7-layer CNN network \nwas evaluated in this experiment. The linear layered CNN \nstructure, without additional modules, was trained for 120 \nepochs. The proposed network architecture consists of \nconvolutional blocks followed by b atch normalization and \nRectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. Three out \nof the seven convolutional blocks are accompanied by max \npooling and dropout layers to enhance the model's \ngeneralization ability. Fig. 6 illustrates the performance and \nROC curve of the baseline 7 -layer CNN is presented. The \nevaluation of the trained baseline model on a separate dataset \nyielded an accuracy of 92.05%. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

By utilizing parallel convolution \nwith different kernel sizes, Inception -ResNet blocks lower \nthe network's computational expense and enhance feature \nextraction by combining the input image with multiple \nparallel convoluted images. The trained model achieves a \ntest set accuracy of 98.50%, with additional metric results \nprovided in Table 2. Figure 7 displays the model's \nperformance and ROC curve. \n \n3) Effectiveness of the CBAM Block \n \nIn this study, the impact of incorporating a CBAM \nblock into the network used in the previous experiment is \nanalyzed. CBAM enhances spatial and channel features, \nleading to improved accuracy and generalization for \nsignificant feature extraction. After training the model with \nCBAM, it achieved an enhanced accuracy of 98.75% on a \nnew testing dataset, which is 0.25% higher than the previous \nablation study.

By utilizing \nglobal and local information and incorporating channel \nshuffling techniques, the Shuffle Transformer can effectively \nand accurately capture c omplex features in images. The \nnetwork was trained for 120 epochs and achieved a test set \naccuracy of 97.44%.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS \n \nTable 3 presents the performance evaluation between the \nexisting works and the proposed model.

The \nproposed model integrates various compo nents, such as \nInception-ResNet, Convolutional Block Attention Module \n(CBAM), Shuffle Transformer, and Coordinate Attention \nmechanism. Transfer learning -based approaches were quite \nsuccessful in disease detection and these methods have an \naccuracy in the r ange of 95 to 98%. Although transfer \nlearning can be an effective method to achieve high accuracy \nrates, it is crucial to acknowledge that pre -trained \narchitectures may not always be suitable for every task. In \ncontrast to prior studies that did not incorp orate attention or \ncontext mechanisms, the proposed customized CNN model \nwas more successful in identifying grape leaf diseases. The \nproposed system leverages the connections among features \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

CONCLUSION \n \nGrapes offer numerous nutritional benefits, including \nhigh levels of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. \nHowever, diverse climatic conditions during grape \ncultivation make them susceptible to different diseases. \nCurrent disease detection methods rely on manual visual \nrecognition of symptoms, leading to delayed treatment and \npotential crop loss. Advanced computer vision techniques \ncan address this challenge by providing automatic and \naccurate disease classification. This research proposes a \nnovel network for grap e leaf disease detection with two \nfeature extraction tracks for precise classification. The first \ntrack utilizes Inception-ResNet blocks and CBAM to achieve \noptimal balance and enhance feature representation. CBAM \nintegrates Channel and Spatial Attention mechanisms to \nfocus on informative channels and spatial regions. The \nsecond track employs a Shuffle transformer to effectively \nextract long -range dependencies . The features from both \ntracks are combined and subjected to the Coordinate \nattention module to fu rther refine feature representation for \nprecise classification. The proposed model, trained on the \nGrape leaf disease dataset from Plant Village, achieves an \naccuracy of 99.56%. The proposed network is limited to \ndetect disease patterns  acquired from constrained leaf \nportions under experimental setup. Though it performs well \nfor these constrained setup, as an extension, further research \nis required to detect diseases from large scale landscape \nimages acquired through drones for real -time deployment. \nOther p otential future research directions include refining \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.
