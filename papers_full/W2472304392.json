A typical AC \nCT consists of a toroidal ferromagnetic core, on which a \ncopper wire of N  turns is wound [ 1]. The CT has  the \nbushing, rod type design. The primary winding consists of \na firmly built -in aluminium or copper band, the end of \nwhich is finished either with a flag- shaped end terminal or \nwith a terminating rod.  The secondary winding consists of \nturns N. A typical AC CT arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. \nThe conductor carrying the measured time- varying current \ni1 acts as the primary of the current transformer. The toroid \ncan be clamped around the current-carrying conductor. The \nwinding wound on the toroid acts as the secondary of the \ncurrent transformer i2. The burden resistance Rb is selected \ndepending on the sensitivity that is required. For better \nperformance, current transformer cores are desired to have \nhigh permeability, high resistivity, low hysteresis and eddy \ncurrent losses  [2]. The cores are made of a high grade \nferromagnetic alloys or magnetically oriented transformer \nsheets. On the outer side of encapsulated core are wound \nthe secondary windings for output currents  of 5 A or 1 A. \nAll active parts of transformer are encasted into epoxi resin  \n(Fig. 2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Basic circuit of the current transformer \n \nThe current transformers are designed for normal \noperation, it means, the B-H curve dependence of iron core \nis linear. Under  normal operation the difference between \nprimary current i1 and secondary current i2 is given by their \nratio and the magnetizing current can be neglected.  The \naccuracy of CT in this case is very high, approximately \n0.5%.  \nDifferent situation is during short circuit conditions in \npower network, when the primary current of CT is several \ntimes higher then under normal operation. It causes the \nnon-linear behavior of the current transformer. As it is \nknown, the DC offset in the fault current foll owing into \nprotective core of current transformer can cause steel to \nsaturate and produce a distorted secondary current [3 –6]. \nTo know exactly a real primary current during fault \noperation is very important for the correct action of \nprotection relays and also for the analysis focused on \nfaults’ identification and localization.  \n \nFig. 2. A real current transformer \n \nIn this paper a real CT is investigated under transient \ncondition. It is bar primary bushing type CT TTR61.11 \n(Fig. 1, 2) with one measuring and one protective winding. \nThe nameplate of CT is following: rated primary current I 1 \n= 600 A, secondary current I 2 = 5 A, the ratio is 120. The \nparameters of CT equivalent circuit for protective winding \nare measured and used in its mathematical model. T he B-H \ncurve is included into mathematical model of transformer \nand it is expressed by function of magnetizing inductance \nversus magnetizing current. The simulated current results \nof sudden short circuit in the network are compared with \nmeasured ones. \n \nNonlinear mathematical model of CT  \n \nThe nonlinear mathematical model of CT can be \ndescribed in accordance with general equivalent circuit of \ntransformer,  but  the  secondary \n winding is combined with  \nA \nl \ni1 \ni2 \nRb \nN \n30 \n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nburden as it can be seen in Fig.  1 and Fig.  3. It consists of  \nlumped parameters of primary winding (resistance of \nprimary winding R1, leakage inductance of primary \nwinding L1), secondary winding (resistance R 2, leakage \ninductance L2) connected with burden equivalent resistance \nRb. In real conditions, Rb is resistance of analogue or digital \ntester. The lumped parameters of secondary winding are \nreferred to the primary side of transformer. The \nmagnetizing branch is repr esented by a non -linear \nmagnetizing inductance L µ, which is a function of \nmagnetizing current I µ. The eddy current loss is neglected \nso no resistance has been included in the circuit for this \npower loss. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3. An equivalent circuit of current transformer \n \nThe mathematical model of current transformer \nconsists of following equations \n )()()( 21 tititi µ+= . (1) \nThe induced voltage vi is given by the equation \n dt\ntdNtvi\n)()( Φ= , (2) \nwhere Φ – magnetic flux ; N – the turn ratio of the \ntransformer \n dt\ntdiLRtidt\ntdN )()()( 2\n2 +=Φ , (3) \n bRRR += 2  (4) \n bLLL += 2 , (5) \nwhere Lb could be inductance of burden.  \nVery important task is to establish the relationship \nbetween magnetising current and magnetizing inductance, \nwhat is non -linear behaviour. It can be obtained from \nmeasurement or from analytical calculation. In this paper \nthis non-linear dependence is taken from measurement and \nincluded into mathematical and simulation model of the \ncurrent transformer. Generally, magnetizi ng inductance \ncan be expressed \n \ndH\ndB\nl\nANL\n2\n=µ , (6) \nwhere A is the area of ferromagnetic core o f transformer, \nl is the length of the magnetic path  (see Fig. 1), dB/dH is \nthe differential permeability or the slope of the B -H \ncharacteristic. \nThe equation (2) can be rewritten \n ivdt\ndiL =µ\nµ , (7) \nwhere Lμ= f(Iμ). \nThe combination of equations ( 1), (3) and (7) can be \nobtained: \n \n\n\n +−+= µ\nµµ\nµ\ndt\ntdiLtRiRiiLLdt\ntdi )()()(\n1)( 1\n1 . (8) \nIf the secondary current is known from the \nmeasurement, a real primary current can be calculated \nfrom equation (1). This mathematical model is simulated \nunder Matlab/Simulink program. A real CT  is simulated \nwith parameters obtained from measurements.  \n \nMeasurement of CT equivalent circuit parameters  \n \nThis measurement is similar as for classical \ntransformers. The arrangement of measurement is shown \nin Fig. 4.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4. The parameters measurement equipment \n \nThe resistances of primary and secondary parts have \nbeen measured by Ohm’s method. The primary resistance \nR\n1 = 17.86 µΩ and secondary resistance is R2 = 0.305 Ω.  \nAlso the transformer ratio has been measured and it is \n120. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5. Dependence of magnetizing inductance versus \nmagnetizing current \n \nVery important parameter is magnetizing inductance. \nAs it has been mentioned above, it is not constant value, \nbut it depends on magnetizing current. This parameter has \nbeen measured  from no -load measurement and the \ndependence of L\nμ= f(Iμ) is shown in the Fig. 5. \nL1 \nLμ= f(Iμ) v1 \nR1 \niμ \ni1 L2 R2 \nRb i2 \nvi \nLµ \n[H] \nIµ [A] \n31 \n \nThis dependence L μ= f( Iμ) is used in the nonlinear \nmathematical model of CT. \nThe leakage inductances of primary and secondary \nwindings have been measured from short -circuit \nmeasurement as a total inductance L = 0.008 H. \n  \nSimulation results \n \nThe simulation model  has been created under \nSimulink program for transients (see Fig. 6 ). The transients \nwere supposed as a sudden short circuit in network for line \ndistance approximately 10 km , what has been chosen on \nthe base of a real sudden short circuit in the network. In the \nmodel, the nonlinear dependence of magnetizing \ninductance versus magnetizing current has been taken into \naccount.  \n \n \nFig. 6. Transient simulation model under Simulink \n \nAs it has been mentioned above, the transient operation \nis simulated for sudden short circuit in the line distance \n10 km in network of 22 kV . The short circuit secondary  \ncurrent isc has been calculated from following equation: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nω−= τ−\nteIi\nt\nscsc cos2 , (9) \nwhere Isc – steady state short circuit secondary  current ten \ntimes higher than its rated current ; τ – time constant given \nby parameters of network. Network’s resistance R n = 0.43 \nΩ.km-1 and inductance Ln = 1.2 mH.km-1 were used in this  \nsimulations. The operation of protection relays was \nneglected in presented simulation.  \nThe simulated secondary current is in the Fig. 7 . From \ntime 0 to 0.08 s there is normal rated operation, the \nsecondary rms current is 5  A. At the time 0.08  s, the \nsudden short circuit is occurred. \nThe magnetizing current waveform is shown in the \nFig. 8. As it is clear form this Fig. 8, the magnetizing \ncurrent is not sinusoidal during transient and there can be \nseen dependence of nonlinear part of B -H curve expressed \nby means of magnetizing inductance. \nIn the Fig. 10 there is comparison of primary currents \nfor linear and nonlinear case. The linear case means, that \nthe primary current is calculated only by means of \ntransformer ratio. The error is approximately 0.4 %.  \nIn the Fig.11 is shown the logarithmical dependence \nof errors for linear and nonlinear cases versus current ratio \nIsc / IN. As it can be seen the errors are low up to ratio 100, \nwhat is under 2%. For higher short circuit currents, the \nnonlinear transformer model is more di fferent and it is \nrecommended to use it for more accuracy simulation. \n \n \nFig. 7. Transient simulated waveform of secondary current \n \n \nFig. 8. Transient simulated waveform of magnetizing current \n \nIn the Fig.  9, there can be seen simulated pr imary \ncurrent.  \n \nFig. 9. Transient simulated waveform of primary current \n \n \nFig. 10. Comparison of linear and nonlinear mathematical model \nfor transient primary current \n \n32 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 11. Percentage error between linear and nonlinear cases for \ndifferent current ratio \n \nExperimental results  \n \n The obtained simulated waveforms have been verified \nby measurement.  \n \nFig. 12. Transient measured waveform of primary current \n \nThey were compared with current waveform recorded \nby protection re lay of 22 kV power line (Fig . 12 ) during \nthe fault caused by snow calamity . As it can  be seen from \nFig. 9 and Fig. 12 , the shape of both waveforms is very \nsimilar and difference is very small. These results confirm \nthat created mathematical model represents very closely \nthe behavior of real current transformer. Therefore it could \nbe used in bigger model of 22 kV power network, which \nwas created to analyze new methods for faults’ \nidentification and localization.  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn this paper a real current transformer was analyzed by \nsimulation and verified by measurement. The mathematical \nnonlinear model was defined, created and described. The \nsimulations have been carried out for steady state and also \nfor transients during sudden short circuit operation. The \nresults were compared with l inear model. Created current \ntransformer model will be used in bigger simulation mo del \nof medium voltage network. The simulation results are \ncompared also with measured ones  and they are in good \ncoincidence. It will help by the development of new \nmethod for fault identification and localization. \n \nAcknowledgment \n \nThis work was supported by the Slovak Research and \nDevelopment Agency under the contract No. APVV -0560-\n07.
