    "abstract": "Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a continuing massive excitement for machine-to-machine communications to encourage individual devices to use the internet for data sharing. This work introduces the design and performance of continuous transformer monitoring and failure diagnostic and documents main distribution transformers indicators such as load current, transformer oil level, gas formation, and temperature. By using this project one must continuously take a look at it and it will reduce progress and maximize the stability, accuracy, and performance of this project. The sensors are used to track recurrent errors or voltage intake variations. The observed information is transmitted to the microcontroller and it tests parameter limitations that send it to the IoT web server using the IoT module. This data sharing means that the appropriate data are presented to the customer and before any significant errors occur according to the collected data the user will make useful choices.",
