It is intended to provide a reference for anyone involved in the procurement\nprocess. This includes not only users and purchasers but also manufacturers and\nsuppliers. Each of the main steps in the procurement process is described in its own\nchapter, with detailed guidance on how user expectations and requirements can best\nbe identi ﬁed and met. Each chapter has been written by experts in the ﬁeld and then\nreviewed in detail by the editorial panel. In addition, the editorial panel has tried to\nensure a clear and consistent use of terminology.\nCIGRE has long had an interest in the transformer and reactor procurement\nprocess. The ﬁrst working group speci ﬁcally addressing this subject was 12.15 on\ntransformer speci ﬁcations, (CIGRE Brochure 156 2000). This working group was\nfollowed by 12.22 on transformer design reviews, (CIGRE Brochure 204 2002).\nCIGRE returned to the subject of transformer procurement some years later with\nthe creation of working group A2.36. This working group had the role of reviewing\nthe whole of the transformer procurement process. They provided an overview of the\nwhole process, which was used to develop the table of contents of this Green Book.\nThey addressed three stages of the procurement process in detail in their ﬁnal reports.\nCIGRE brochure 528 (2013) was a comprehensive update of the earlier CIGRE\nbrochure 156 (2000). Likewise, CIGRE brochure 529 (2013) was a comprehensive\nupdate of the earlier CIGRE brochure 204 (2002). CIGRE brochure 530 (2013) is a\nguide for conducting “transformer factory capability assessments ”, that is, for\ntransformer supplier quali ﬁcation and development. It was a new departure for\nCIGRE, and of special interest to users purchasing transformers or reactors from\nunfamiliar suppliers.\nCIGRE working group A2.42 was established to continue the work of A2.36 on\ntransformer transportation (CIGRE Brochure 673 2016). CIGRE working group\nA2.58 was then established to continue the work of A2.36 and A2.42 on transformer\nvii\nand reactor installation, pre-commissioning, and trial operation. Their ﬁnal report\nwas in preparaion at the time this Green Book was published.\nTransformer Procurement in the Future\nCIGRE’s work has increasingly been focused on two related challenges – ensuring\nuniversal access to reliable electricity and ensuring the sustainability of the electric-\nity supply. These two challenges cannot be addressed separately, as universal access\nto reliable electricity is critically dependent on better integration of distributed\nrenewable energy resources. Aspects of these challenges of special relevance for\ntransformers and reactors include (Hatziargyriou and de Siqueira 2020):\n Improved transformers for solar integration\n Improved transformers for wind integration\n Higher AC and DC transmission voltages, to allow integration of renewable\nenergy resources in remote areas\n Increased use of phase-shifting transformers, to control power ﬂows\n Site assembly of large power transformers, also to allow integration of renewable\nenergy resources in remote areas\n Development of alternative technologies to the conventional oil-immersed trans-\nformer or reactor\n Better control of audible sound levels\n Better control of losses\n Improved transformer and reactor life management\n Improved designs to cope with variations in system voltage\n Improved designs to cope with variations in system frequency\nSome of the transformer and reactor technologies developed to meet these\nchallenges are suf ﬁciently mature to be included in this Green Book. The following\nmaterial is of special relevance:\n Improved transformers for solar and wind integration\nIdentiﬁcation of functional requirements, including the possible impact of har-\nmonics, is addressed in ▶Chap. 3. Speciﬁcation, including the possible impact of\nthe installation environment, is addressed in ▶Chaps. 4 and ▶5.\nSpecial aspects of testing for transformers for wind integration are addressed in\n▶Chaps. 12 and ▶14.\n Higher AC and DC transmission voltages, to allow integration of renewable\nenergy resources in remote areas\nIdentiﬁcation of functional requirements is addressed in ▶Chap. 3. Engineering and\ndesign for these requirements, using advanced methods, is addressed in ▶Chap. 10.\nDielectric testing is of special relevance and is addressed in ▶Chap. 14 .\nPre-commissioning is also of special relevance and is addressed in▶Chap. 18.\nviii Foreword\n Increased use of phase-shifting transformers, to control power ﬂows,\nIs not directly addressed in this Green Book but is the subject of IEC/IEEE\nstandard 60076-57-1202 (2017).\n Site assembly of large power transformers, also to allow integration of renewable\nenergy resources in remote areas,\nIs not directly addressed in this Green Book but is the subject of CIGRE working\ngroup A2.59, who published their ﬁnal report as brochure 857 in 2021.\n Development of alternative technologies to the conventional oil-immersed trans-\nformer or reactor\nIdentiﬁcation of functional requirements, including the appropriate design con-\ncept, is addressed in ▶Chap. 3 . Alternative design concepts are integrated into\nthe remaining chapters of the Green Book as far as possible.\n Better control of audible sound levels\nSpeciﬁcation of audible sound levels is addressed in ▶Chap. 6 .\n Better control of losses\nSpeciﬁcation of losses and ef ﬁciency is addressed in ▶Chap. 7 .\n Improved transformer and reactor life management\nTransformer and reactor life management will be the subject of a future Green\nBook. However, life management begins with procurement, which is the subject\nof the present Green Book. The speci ﬁcation is of special relevance, owing to its\nimpact on maintenance requirements, and is addressed in ▶Chaps. 4 and ▶5.\n Improved designs to cope with variations in system voltage and frequency\nIdentiﬁcation of functional requirements, including the possible impact of varia-\ntions in system voltage or frequency, is addressed in ▶Chap. 3 .

Khayakazi Dioka, Prof Paul Jarman, John Lapworth, Asgeir Mjelve,\nSanthiago Montenegro, Prof Alvaro Portillo, Adesh Singh, Craig Swindermann,\nAnthony Walsh, Ross Willoughby, and Bert Wouters.\nThe editors also gratefully acknolwedge the contributions of all members of\nCIGRE working groups A2.36, A2.42, and A2.58. The authors are especially\ngrateful for the contribution of the late AC “Sam” Hall, to whose memory this\nGreen Book is dedicated.\nThis Green Book is dedicated by CIGRE Study Committee A2 to the memory of\nArthur Conway “Sam” Hall, who did so much in his long career to improve\ntransformer procurement practices.\nSam Hall was born in 1932 at Westerhope, near to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the\nindustrial northeast of England. He began work as an apprentice with CA Parsons, a\nlocal transformer manufacturer, in 1948 at the age of 16. After completing his\napprenticeship, he studied high-voltage engineering at Heriot-Watt University in\nEdinburgh, returning to CA Parsons in the design department. He was an early\npioneer of computer-aided design for transformers. He left CA Parsons in 1965 to\njoin the Central Electricity Generating Board at the peak of the development of the\n400 kV transmission network in Great Britain. Here, he made important contribu-\ntions to improving transformer speci ﬁcations, design review, and factory acceptance\ntesting. He also made important improvements in transformer life management, and\nwas an early pioneer of the use of frequency response analysis for transformer\ndiagnosis. On the breaking up of the Central Electricity Generating Board, he joined\nNational Grid. In 1995, at the age of 63, he retired from National Grid and founded\nhis own consultancy business. He continued to work as a consultant until shortly\nbefore his death in 2015, making important contributions to the development of\nHVDC in India and the reliability of wind turbine transformers in Great Britain.\nSam Hall gave generously of his time and expertise to CIGRE, attending most if\nnot all the colloquiums and sessions. Of his many contributions to CIGRE, perhaps\nthe most important was in convening working group 12.15 on transformer speci ﬁ-\ncations. This represented the ﬁrst attempt by CIGRE to bring transformer users and\nmanufacturers together to improve the quality of transformers by improving the\nprocurement process. Sam Hall was able to bring his experience in both transformer\ndesign and construction and in transformer life management together to make this\nxi\nworking group a success. He later made a very important contribution to working\ngroup A2.36, which looked at the transformer procurement process more widely. It is\nfor these contributions to CIGRE, and the industry more widely, that this Green\nBook is dedicated to his memory.\nOutside work, Sam Hall was a well-known sailor and a well-known supporter of\nthe Royal National Institute for the Blind. He was survived by his wife Dorothy, his\nchildren Michael and Kerry, and his ﬁve grandchildren. At his funeral, his son\nMichael said, “We shall not cry for his life that has ended, but smile for his life\nlived.”\nProf. Paul Jarman\nxii Acknowledgments\nContents\n1 Overview of Transformer and Reactor Procurement ........... 1\nTom Breckenridge and Simon Ryder\n2 Tender Process for Transformers .......................... 1 3\nKhayakazi Dioka and Bert Wouters\n3 Identi ﬁcation of Functional Requirements for Transformers\nand Shunt Reactors ..................................... 3 3\nTom Breckenridge and Mike Lamb\n4 Speci ﬁcations for Transformers and Reactors – Design and\nConstruction .......................................... 6 7\nTara-Lee MacArthur and Adesh Singh\n5 Speci ﬁcations – Components and Fittings ................... 9 9\nTara-Lee MacArthur and Adesh Singh\n6 Speci ﬁcation of Sound Levels for Transformers and Reactors .... 1 3 7\nGilson M.
