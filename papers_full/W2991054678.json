INTRODUCTION \nTransformers are exposed to various electrical and mechanical f ailures during their lifespan. Some \nof these were caused by mishandling during maintenance and tran sportation, earthquake, and even external \nfaults. Extended outages, costly repairs and potentially seriou s fault mostly occurred to transformer active \nparts which are the core and windings. It is found that, core d amage is more likely as a result of shocks cause \nby transportation, while winding damage is caused by short circ uit (SC) forces [2,3]. To assess the condition \nand mechanical reliability of transformers, frequency response analysis (FRA) is proven to be a powerful and \neffective method [4-8]. It is highly sensitive to electrical or  mechanical changes in transformers. For \nexample, [9] has presented the effect of shunt impedance, high voltage bushing and length of measurement \nlead in the response. In [10], the reference observed the respo nse sensitivity towards the capacitance and \nmutual inductance between the windings. Reference [11] studied the response sen sitivity towards \ntemperature and moisture content of the transformer insulation.  It showed there is a considerable change in \nthe response indicating that it is highly sensitive even on non-mechanical factor. Reference [12] had reviewed \nliterature related to the aspect that must be considered when i mplementing SFRA method, which is \nconnection of non-tested terminals when diagnosing winding fail ures. Reference [13] has found that the \nwinding response of an autotrans former can be affected by the t ertiary winding due to coupling effect \nbetween windings. More studies are necessary to further understand this sensitivity of FRA measurement.  \n\n                ISSN: 2088-8694 \n Int J Pow Elec & Dri Syst Vol. 11, No. 1, Mar 2020 :  409 – 416 \n410\nThis paper is proposing to investigate the effect of fault whic h occurred in other winding on the \nresponse of the measured winding. The measurements in this stud y were conducted on three-phase \ntransformers at a local research utility company. FRA end-to-en d open circuit test is used, and the fault is \nshort circuit turns that was created by shorting the terminals on the tap changers. \n \n \n2. SHORT CIRCUIT FAULT IN TRANSFORMER WINDING \nAccording to [14], faulty winding usually occurs in distributio n transformers. This is because the \ncurrent flow in the primary winding undergoes electromagnetic i nduction voltage which is stepped down. \nThe current is then stepped up in the secondary winding. During this process, the secondary windings have to \nwithstand electrical, thermal and mechanical stresses [15].  Several types of faulty windings such as the SC \nf a u l t  c o m m o n l y  o c c u r r e d  d u e  t o  t h e s e  s t r e s s e s .  T h e  o c c u r e n c e  o f S C  i s  q u i t e  r a r e ,  b u t  t h e  p r o b a b i l i t y  i s  \nincreased during the transformer lifetime which is typically up  to 50 years [16]. In spite of this, according to \n[3], about 40% of the transformer faults are initiated by huge impact of SC every year.  \nOne of the sources contribute to SC fault is insulation breakdo wn. Insulation breakdown usually \noccurs due to high current and voltage which is above the rated  values. The breakdown of the insulation \nresults in flashover between two turns and causes inter-turn SC  fault. Besides that, thermal losses in copper \nwill produce hotspots in the winding. This over time causes tear of the insulation and decrease of the physical \nstrength up to the point of breaking of the winding. Ultimately, causing SC fault in the winding. According to \n[17], SC faults are divided into three basic categories. These are winding-to-ground fault, winding-to-\nwinding fault, and turn-to-turn fault on the same winding. Turn-to-turn or inter-turn short SC fault is the most \ncommonly to occur. Figure 1 illustrates the occurrence of inter-turn SC fault due to insulation breakdown. \nIn general, SC in the winding causes reduction of the winding e lectrical length. In case of winding \ncoupled with magnetic core, the main sign of internal short-cir cuit fault is a significant increase of first \nantiresonance in frequency response corresponding to open secon dary winding [18]. The frequency range is \ntypically several Hz up to few kHz, which is the low frequency (LF) region. The key point to understand the \nLF variation affected by shorted turns can be obtained in the d escription of Faraday’s law in the shorted \nturns. The law states that the “electromagnetic force (emf) induced in a turn is equal to the rate of variation of \nthe electromagnetic flux inside it” [19]. The paper also presen ts finite-element method (FEM) showing the \nchanges of magnetizing characteristics of core, which causes th e LF deviation. This important property can \nb e  u s e d  a s  o n e  o f  t h e  m a i n  i n d i c a t i o n s  o f  w i n d i n g  S C  f a u l t .  H o wever, it must be remembered that the \ndeviation of the LF responses is not a sign the presence of the  SC in the winding under measurement only, \nbecause the increases occur in the frequency responses of all windings on the same core [20].  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

Mea surement is conducted per phase \nwith the secondary winding is left open circuit. The study is conducted by measuring and comparing the FRA \nresponse before and after the presence of SC fault in the windi ng. In this study, the FRA measurement is \nconducted on the HV winding of phase A, B and C one after anoth er. While the fault is applied at the LV \nwinding of phase a, b and c consecutively. This is to observe w hether fault at winding of other phases can \nactually affect the response of measured phase. \nFigure 2(a) shows a short and thin cable was used to connect be tween two terminals (shown in \ncircle) of a Dyn11, 360VA transformer. This causes 1/3 of the t otal LV winding to be shorted or removed \nfrom the main winding. Figure 2(b) shows the schematic diagram of the short circuit fault. On the other hand, \nthe fault in second transformer is created by connecting a cabl e to the exposed transformer taps in each \nphase. This is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3(a) shows the physica lly simulated short circuit fault on tap 3-4 of \nphase B and Figure 3(b) shows the schematic diagram of the simulated fault.  \n \n \n \n(a)  \n(b) \n  \nFigure 2.

THE ANALYSIS OF SHORT CIRCUIT EFFECT TO OTHER WINDING PHASES \nFigure 4 and Figure 5 show the frequency responses of two diffe rent transformers before the fault is \nsimulated on the transformer windings.  \nFrom Figure 4, the low frequency region of FRA response for pha se B, which is middle phase \nwinding shows a slight variation from the other two phases. As discussed in [13], this is due to the magnetic \npath of middle phase which is slightly different from the side phases (side limbs). Meanwhile, the variation \nof FRA responses at medium frequency region is affected by the three-phase coupling between the windings. \nFigure 5 shows the measured responses of end to end open circui t test on the 500kVA transformer. \nClearly it shows there are slight variations between phases A, B and C. Such variation is due to the condition \nof the transformer which is not new. The transformer itself was  manufactured in 1984 and was taken out of \nservice due to a fault near bushing. The windings have several dents, but these were minimal. The turn ratio \nand winding resistance test for both transformers indicate that the windings are still in good conditions. \n \n4.1.  Response phase A \nFigure 6 shows the responses where FRA measurement is conducted at phase A of HV winding. The \nshort circuit fault is simulated on phase a, b and c of LV wind ing consecutively. From Figure 6, response \n‘Normal A’ represents the response before the short circuit fau lt is applied on the winding. The other \nresponses represent the response after fault have applied on the winding respectively. \n\n                ISSN: 2088-8694 \n Int J Pow Elec & Dri Syst Vol. 11, No. 1, Mar 2020 :  409 – 416 \n412\n  \nFigure 4. FRA response on normal winding condition \nof 360VA transformer \nFigure 5. FRA response on normal winding \ncondition of 500kVA transformer \n  \n  \n \nFigure 6. Frequency responses of phase A from 360VA transformer \n \n \nFigure 6 shows the comparison of response normal A and when SC fault has occurred on its LV \nwinding. It is the result of the FRA measurement that was condu cted at the same phase as the faulty winding. \nThe response significantly shifted to right, towards higher frequencies. This can be explained using (1), \n \n𝛷 ∝  𝑁𝐼 (1) \n \nEquation (1) shows that the amount of flux, 𝛷 is directly proportional to the product of the number \nof turns, N and the current flow in the winding, I. In general, the internal SC leads to reduction of the \nelectrical length of the winding, meaning reduction of N [20]. When the number of turns reduces, the flux \nformed in the coil also reduced. As a result, during SC fault, the magnetizing inductance of the right-side \nlimb is drastically reduced and caused the magnitude in low fre quency region to increase. The large amount \nof shift is affected by the magnetizing inductance in the limb of the core caused by the SC fault in the \nsecondary winding of the same phase. It causes a substantial effect in the response of phase A.  \nFigure 6 also shows the responses when SC fault is on phase b ( LV winding). The response of LF \nregion is seen to be slightly shifted towards higher frequencie s. The shifting is much less when compared to \nthe previous case. This is because the faulty is not located at  the same phase as the measured winding. \nFinally, for response when fault occurred in phase c, the initi al antiresonance of the response is marginally \nshifted towards higher-frequencies. The degree of shifting is s maller when compared to the previous cases. \nThis is because the fault occurred at winding phase c that is located furthest away from the measured winding \n(Phase A). Basically, the response of winding phase A when faul t y  i n  p h a s e  b  s h i f t e d  m o r e  c o m p a r e d  t o  \nwhen fault in phase c. This can be explained with the help of Figure 7, (2) and (3). \n \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n  \nFigure 7.

The flux flow in the core and pass through each limb. The length of \nflux path flowing from phase A (source) and pass through the ce ntral limb, lB (phase B) is measured from \npoint E, A, B to F. Meanwhile, the length of flux path for the left-side limb, lC (phase C) is measured from \npoint E, A, C, D, B to F. The lB is shorter compared to the lC, thus the reluctance of the central limb R B is \nlower than RC as in (2). ꭕ in (2) is either phase A, B or C. As the reluctan ce of the central limb, R B is lower, \nthe flux that pass through central limb, ΦB is higher than the flux in left-side limb, ΦC. \n \n𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑒𝑚𝑓 ൌ 4.44𝑁𝑓Φm (3) \n \nNow that we have established that Φ B is higher than Φ C, let relate the flux with the back EMF. \nTheoretically, the back EMF of phase B is higher compared to ba ck EMF of phase C. This is because Φ B is \nhigher than Φ C a s  r e f e r r e d  t o  ( 3 ) .  A s  a  r e s u l t ,  t h e  r e s p o n s e  w h e n  t h e  f a u l t  is at phase b is more affected \ncompared to fault at phase c as can be seen in Figure 6.  \nFigure 8 shows the FRA response for Dyn11, 500kVA transformer w here the measurement is \nconducted at Phase A, while the SC fault is simulated on phase a, b and c winding consecutively. Clearly, \nwhen fault is simulated at the same phase, the response signifi cantly shifted towards higher frequency. It is \nalso shown that response due to faulty in phase b shifted more compared to faulty in phase c. This finding is \nsimilar to the previous case on the first transformer. \n \n4.2 Response phase B \nIn this case, the FRA measurement is conducted at winding of th e middle limb, phase B, while fault \nis applied on the LV windings consecutively. The measured responses are given in Figure 9. \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 8. Frequency response of phase A from 500 \nkVA transformer. \nFigure 9. Frequency response of phase B for 360VA \ntransformer \n \n \nFrom Figure 9, the response shows different pattern of effect w hen compared to the previous case. \nI n  t h i s  c a s e ,  t h e  r e s p o n s e  w h e n  S C  f a u l t  o c c u r r e d  i n  t h e  p h a s e  a and c affected almost similarly. This is \nbecause the fault is on phase a and c that are located adjacent  to the measured phase which is phase b. This \ncan be explained by Figure 10 and (2). \nFrom Figure 10, when FRA measurement is performed at HV winding  of phase B, current flows in \nthe winding and flux is produced in the core. The length of the  flux path flowing from phase B (source) and \npass through the right-side limb, lA (phase A) is considered from point E, C, D to F. Meanwhile, the length of \nflux path for the left-side limb, lC (phase C) is measured from point E, A, B to F. The length for both flux path \nis similar, thus the reluctance for both right and left-side li mb, RA and RC are also similar. This can be prove \nusing equation (2). As the reluctance of both limbs are similar, the flux that pass through in both right and left \nside limb are also similar. In addition to that, ΦA is almost similar to ΦC. Therefore, the back EMF of phase A \nis also almost similar to back EMF of phase C as referred to (3 ). For this reason, the FRA response when \nshort circuit fault occurs in phase a and c, the response is almost similarly affected as can be seen in Figure 9. \n\n                ISSN: 2088-8694 \n Int J Pow Elec & Dri Syst Vol. 11, No. 1, Mar 2020 :  409 – 416 \n414\nOn the other hand, when the fault is located at the same phase of the measured winding, the effect of fault on \nthe response is very large. This is similar to the case of FRA measurement on phase A and fault is on phase a. \nAgain, the procedure is repeated on the second transformer to v erify this initial finding. Figure 11 \nshows the FRA responses for Dyn11, 500kVA transformer when measurement is conducted at phase B. \nFrom figure 11, the FRA response for SC fault at phase a and c shows a slight variation. Here, we \nare expecting that responses of phase B with fault at phase a a nd phase c will have similar variations. \nHowever, both responses are not exactly similar. This is probab ly due to the condition of the winding (phase \na and c) itself which are not perfectly identical even though t he same faults are being applied. As mentioned \ne a r l i e r ,  t h i s  i s  a  t r a n s f o r m e r  t h a t  m a n u f a c t u r e d  m o r e  t h a n  3 0  years ago. Therefore, such slight different \nbetween fault at phase a and fault at phase c is acceptable.  \n \n4.3.  Response phase C \nThe last case presents the FRA measurement conducted at the HV winding of the left-side limb or \nphase C, while the faulty winding is on the LV winding of phase a, b and c consecutively as previous cases. \nFigure 12(a) shows the responses experience the same pattern as  i n  t h e  f i r s t  c a s e  w h e r e  t h e  \nmeasurement is conducted on phase A. Basically if the fault loc ated on the same phase as measured winding, \nt h e  e f f e c t  o n  r e s p o n s e  i s  h u g e .  O n  t h e  o t h e r  h a n d ,  i f  t h e  f a u l t is located further away from the measured \nwinding, the effect is smaller or reduced. Similar trend can be  seen on the second transformer as shown in \nFigure 12(b). These results verify the initial finding in [1].  Table 3 shows the summary of the results \nobtained. \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 10. Equivalent magnetic circuit of FRA \nmeasurement conducted at phase B \nFigure 11.

The response will significantly be \nshifted towards higher frequencies. Meanwhile, when the faulty is near or adjacent to the measured phase \nwinding, the response will moderately be affected. In case of F RA measurement is conducted in the middle \nlimb, responses of both right and left side limbs will be affec ted almost similarly. Finally, as the faulty \nwinding is located furthest away from the measured phase windin g, the response will be slightly shifted \ntowards higher frequencies. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank the TNB Research for the provis ion of test facilities and great \nsupport for the experimental tests.
