    "abstract": "This study explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into nursing education, highlighting a paradigm shift towards interactive learning environments. We aimed to analyze the literature to identify how large language models are being implemented in nursing education, as well as key opportunities and limitations that need to be addressed. English records published since 2022 were retrieved from 4 databases including LLMs in nursing education. A total of 19 records were eligible. As LLMs advanced natural language processing capabilities enable interactive learning experiences, nursing educators are presented with unique opportunities to enhance curriculum delivery, foster critical thinking, and simulate complex clinical scenarios. Through a comprehensive analysis of current applications, limitations and future research, this paper navigates the complexities of adopting LLMs (eg ChatGPT) in nursing education. This paper concludes with a call for action to advance the integration of AI in nursing, enhancing educational outcomes while ensuring ethical, effective use.",
