Already, patients across an estimated 30 countries\ncan access some of their records via secure web portals including\nJMIR Med Educ 2024 | vol. 10 | e51183 | p. 1https://mededu.jmir.org/2024/1/e51183\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBlease et alJMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nhealth apps. In some countries, this innovation is advanced [1].\nSince 2021, the federally enacted 21st Century Cures Act in the\nUnited States mandated that providers offer all patients access\nto download their electronic health records without charge [2].\nIn the Nordic countries, ORA has been implemented\nincrementally, starting around 2010 [3]. The Finnish patient\nportal OmaKanta was rolled out with stepwise implementation\nof functionality between 2010 and 2015 [4]. Patients in Sweden\nfirst obtained ORA in one of 21 regions in 2012 [5] with\nnationwide implementation achieved by 2018. Implementation\nin Norway began in 2015, reaching patients in 3 out of 4 regions\nby 2019 [6]. In England, from October 31, 2023, it is mandatory\nfor general practitioners to offer ORA to their adult patients,\nalbeit on a prospective basis [7].\nPatients with access to their records report using them to become\nmore involved in their care, to follow up on doctors’ visits, and\nto obtain an overview of their test results and treatment history\n[3,8,9]. Multiple surveys show that patients using ORA are\npositive about the experience after reading their notes. They\nreport many benefits including understanding their care plans\nbetter [9], improved communication with and greater trust in\ntheir provider [10], and feeling more in control of their health\nand care [6,8], including doing a better job taking their\nmedications [11,12].\nDespite the patient benefits with ORA, challenges with their\nimplementation in clinical practice remain. In this viewpoint\npaper, we identify outstanding concerns with ORA, which\nencompass a range of unintended consequences for clinician\nwork burdens, and for the substantial task of conveying bespoke,\ncompassionate, and understandable information to each unique\npatient who accesses their records. Currently, it has been\nproposed that a range of targeted patient training and medical\neducation strategies may be sufficient to resolve at least some\nof these challenges [13-17]. We believe that such interventions\nare valuable; however, in this viewpoint paper, we explain why\nthe ambitions of such training interventions may be limited.\nAs a solution, we explain why the use of generative artificial\nintelligence (AI) may offer more tangible long-term promise\nthan clinician training alone in helping to resolve problems with\nORA implementation. While generative AI itself is not new,\nrecent technical advances and the increased accessibility of\nlarge language models (LLMs; GPT-4 by OpenAI, LLaMA by\nMeta, and PaLM2 by Google) have made clinical use\nincreasingly feasible. LLMs are an application of generative AI\ntechnology, often defined as machine learning algorithms that\ncan recognize, summarize, and generate content based on\ntraining on large data sets. Unlike search engines, which offer\npages of internet links in response to typed queries, generative\nLLMs such as GPT-4 simulate well-reasoned answers couched\nas conversations. In addition, these models can “remember”\nprevious prompts, helping to build up the perception of dialogic\nexchange. We review the strengths and limitations of generative\nAI and emphasize that for this innovation to play a key role in\nORA, it will be imperative for humans to be involved as\noverseers of computer input.\nCurrent Challenges With Open Notes\nEvolving Functionality of Records\nGuidelines, such as those issued by the British General Medical\nCouncil, state that clinicians should keep clear, accurate,\ncontemporaneous records that include “...any minor concerns,\nand the details of any action you have taken, information you\nhave shared and decisions you have made relating to those\nconcerns” [18]. In the era of ORA, clinicians will also need to\nconsider if what they write will be understandable, accessible,\nand supportive for patients [19]. With the knowledge that\npatients will read what they write, the functionality of the record\nis evolving, and this incurs changes with respect to how clinical\ninformation is documented [20,21]. Clinicians must uphold the\noriginal functionality of the record—documenting the patient’s\nmedical information in clinical detail, but also communicating\nthis information to the patient. With respect to the latter function,\nit is argued that for records to be understandable and acceptable\nto a lay audience, clinicians should ideally remove or explain\nmedical acronyms, omit medical vernacular that may be\nperceived as offensive (such as “patient denies” or “patient\ncomplains of”), and strive to convey information in a manner\nthat it is straightforward, comprehensive, and empathic in tone\n[14]. This is not an easy undertaking for clinicians tasked with\npitching information at a literacy level that accommodates\ndiverse patient populations while maintaining the clinical utility\nof records and adequately serving their medicolegal functions.\nIndeed, whether such dual functionality is even possible has\nbeen questioned [22].\nDocumentation Changes\nTo date, it is unclear whether ORA diminishes the clinical value\nof documentation [19,23]. However, there is evidence that\nclinicians may be undermining the accuracy or completeness\n(or both) of their records, perhaps in attempts to reduce patient\nanxieties, minimize follow-up contact, or reduce the likelihood\nof potential complaints [24,25]. For example, in the largest\nstudy conducted on clinicians’ experiences of open notes, a\n3-center study at 3 diverse health systems in the United States\n(1628 of 6054, 27% clinicians responded), DesRoches et al [26]\nfound that around 1 in 4 physicians admitted that they changed\nhow they wrote differential diagnoses (23%, n=176), though\nthe nature of these changes is not understood. More worryingly,\nmore than 1 in 5 physicians (22%, n=168) believed that their\nnotes were now less valuable for other clinicians [26].\nConceivably, other changes following implementation of ORA\nmight be more positive. In the study by DesRoches et al [26],\n22% (n=166) of physicians reported changes to the use of a\npartnering language, and 18% (n=139) of them reported changes\nto how they used medical jargon or acronyms. However, it\nremains unknown whether such changes improve the\ncomprehensibility of clinical records among patients or whether\namendments come with a trade-off in terms of documentation\nquality.\nWith ORA, there is also the potential for notes to convey bias\nof stigmatizing language. For example, in the United States,\nrecent linguistic analysis studies have shown that negative\npatient descriptors in notes are considerably more common for\nJMIR Med Educ 2024 | vol. 10 | e51183 | p. 2https://mededu.jmir.org/2024/1/e51183\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBlease et alJMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nnon-Hispanic black patients and for patients with diabetes, those\nwith substance use disorders, and those with chronic pain\n[27,28]. It is unclear whether with the knowledge patients may\nnow read what they write, the use of stigmatizing language\namong these patient populations is being effectively omitted\nand “cleaned up” by clinicians.\nWork Burdens\nTime spent on documentation and patient portal messages\nremains a growing cause of clinician dissatisfaction and burnout\n[29]. The impact is exacerbated for clinicians with lower levels\nof digital competencies, and this “technostress” has been found\nto directly correlate with burnout [30]. Even tech-savvy young\nresident physicians have reported the use of the electronic health\nrecord as a leading cause of burnout [31]. In the United States,\nthe study by DesRoches et al [26] on clinicians’ experiences,\n37% (n=292) of physicians reported spending more time writing\nnotes after patient access was enabled.\nFew studies have explored objective measures of the impact of\nORA, however, where these measures have been implemented,\nsome of them signal potential for increased patient contact. For\nexample, Mold et al [32] found that the provision of ORA in\nprimary care settings resulted in a moderate increase in email\ntraffic from patients, with no change in telephone contact and\nvariable changes to face-to-face contact. A recent Canadian\nstudy found that registration with a primary care web-based\nportal was associated with an increase in the number of visits\nto physicians, calls to practice triage nurses, and an increase in\nclerical workload [33]. Another recent study at an academic\nmedical center in the United States reported a doubling in the\nnumber of messages sent by patients within 6 hours after ORA\nwas implemented [34]. It seems reasonable to postulate that at\nleast some of this increased contact may be driven by patients\nwho desire clarifications about diagnoses, results, or other\ninformation that is documented in their records.\nCurrently Proposed Solutions\nTo encourage confidence with ORA and to overcome some of\nthese challenges, targeted educational programs have been\nproposed. Among them are short lists of tips and advice to\nclinicians, and brief web-based training interventions [13,14,24].\nMore recently, some medical schools have taken this further.\nFor example, Harvard Medical School has embedded within its\ncurriculum practical training in how to write notes that patients\nwill read [16], and similar work is underway in England [35].\nThe expressed aim of such training programs is to support\nphysicians in writing notes efficiently and clearly, preserving\nthe necessary clinical details. These programs also encourage\nstudents and clinicians to write sensitively and empathically,\nremoving loaded jargon or acronyms that may be perceived as\noffensive (eg, “follow-up” instead of “F/U,” or “shortness of\nbreath” instead of “SOB”) [14,16]. Notably, however, calls for\ncurricular adaptations are isolated, perhaps reflecting wider\nuncertainty about ORA among the medical community and the\nperception that the innovation has been foisted on them.\nSimilarly, interventions to advise patients about how to engage\nwith ORA appear limited [14,36]. This may be owed to a fear\namong clinicians that encouraging access to web-based records\nmay exacerbate patient anxiety, lead to increased contact time,\nor risk disagreements and requests to change documentation.\nWe observe that current recommendations in the published and\ngray literature offer advice on the benefits and risks of accessing\nORA, how to maintain password or portal security, and how to\ndiscuss errors or disagreements in their notes with clinicians\n[14,36].\nCombined, these clinician and patient support strategies are\nvaluable but have inherent limitations. Training interventions\nmay be variously implemented and take time to become\nestablished in mainstream medical education. Even beyond\nmainstream inclusion of training in medical curricula, it will\nalso be necessary to target the so-called “hidden\ncurriculum”—the set of unspoken and implicit rules and values\nthat trainees may pick up from their mentors and colleagues\nwithin clinical practice [37]. It is unclear whether even those\nstrategies that attempt to convert senior or experienced doctors\nto the cause are sufficient to counter the hidden curriculum or\nto neutralize the formation of documentation habits that may\nnot be in keeping with the ORA mandate whereupon clinical\nnotes may now be read by patients and caregivers.\nOther recommendations that clinicians should remove all\nacronyms and medical jargon may present practical dilemmas\nfor upholding the quality of documentation. Aside from extra\ntime spent typing documentation, the capacity to shift from\nexpert to patient perspectives poses unappreciated difficulties.\nUndoubtedly, many clinicians, as domain experts, might not\nalways fully appreciate when they are using specialist or\ntechnical language, nor do they have the attendant skills to\nconvey what they know to patients in an understandable way—a\ncluster of problems collectively referred to as “the curse of\nexpertise” [38]. Using imprecise language may also have future\nmedical consequences and might result in harm if later clinicians\nmisinterpret what was written [39].\nRelatedly, it seems a significant request that clinicians write\nnotes that are bespoke for every patient’s level of health literacy.\nYet, each person who attends a clinical visit will have specific\nhealth literacy needs. We suspect that the trade-off may lead to\nclinicians writing notes that are more suited to a readership like\nthem—individuals with higher health literacy and more years\nof formal education.\nSimilarly, while often considered a “soft skill,” the adoption of\nempathetic, encouraging, and supportive language might be a\ntaller order than is frequently assumed. For example,\npsychologists report that negative biases can curb expressions\nof empathy [40-44]. Studies show that empathy can be\ninfluenced by patients’race or ethnicity and may be diminished\namong people presenting with disabilities or already stigmatized\nconditions [40-44]. Making matters worse, self-inspection may\nbe a particularly weak tool for clinicians to excavate and monitor\ntheir own prejudices [45]. Furthermore, the demand that\nclinicians tailor their notes in ways that are optimized to every\npatient’s understanding and their emotional needs may lead to\nnot only increased workload but also higher risk of burnout\n[46].\nJMIR Med Educ 2024 | vol. 10 | e51183 | p. 3https://mededu.jmir.org/2024/1/e51183\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBlease et alJMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nSo far, no objective measures have assessed whether targeted\ntraining strategies are effective at improving clinical\ndocumentation in terms of preserving medical detail and utility,\nstrengthening patient understanding and patients’ perceptions\nof clinician support and empathy. We emphasize that while\ncommonly used in training evaluation, self-report surveys will\nnot be sufficient to establish whether educational interventions\nwork in terms of both preserving the detail in clinical notes and\nsupporting patient understanding.\nFinally, perhaps most crucial of all, and as already noted, it is\nunclear whether narrative notes can ever uphold a genuine dual\nfunctionality targeting the needs of both clinician and patient\nreaderships [22]. Conceivably, both needs are incommensurable\nand there will always be a trade-off in detail and understanding\nshould the patient, or the clinician, be given primacy as target\nreader.\nGenerative Language Models Writing\nClinical Notes\nStrengths of Generative AI\nDoctors strongly desire support with documentation including\nnote writing with surveys showing that they forecast a role for\nAI in assisting in these tasks [47,48]. Because of their promise\nwith respect to administrative and documentation tasks in health\ncare contexts, LLMs have been described as “the ultimate\npaperwork shredder” [49]. Owing to the sheer speed and scope\nof information upon which they draw, LLMs hold considerable\npotential in generating up-to-date, comprehensive clinical\ninformation for patients [50]. This makes the approach\nparticularly promising in generating detailed narrative\nexplanations and summaries of visit encounters. This may help\nto reduce work burdens on physicians tasked with writing\nclinical notes.\nAnother striking strength of LLMs is their capacity to write\nresponses in a requested style or by adopting a specific tone or\nconversational emphasis. This makes LLMs particularly\npromising in assisting with writing notes that omit the use of\nmedical jargon or acronyms that are suitable for patients with\ndifferent levels of health literacy, or among speakers of\nlanguages that differ from their provider’s language. This\ncapacity may also help avoid the extra burdens on clinicians\nattempting to document notes that are tailored to the highly\ndiverse range of unique patient readers.\nPreliminary research also suggests that LLMs may help with\nwriting consistently sensitive or empathic notes. In 2023, a\nhighly publicized study suggested that ChatGPT may have better\nbedside manners than actual human doctors [51]. A team\ncompared written responses of doctors and ChatGPT offered\nto patients’ real-world health queries using Reddit’s AskDocs\nforum, where nearly half a million people post their medical\nproblems and verified and credentialed clinicians offer\nsuggestions. On average, ChatGPT responses were 4 times\nlonger than doctors’ replies. A panel of health care\nprofessionals—blinded to who or what did the\nwriting—preferred ChatGPT’s responses nearly 80% of the\ntime. The panel ranked chatbot answers as being of significantly\nhigher quality than web-based posts reportedly from doctors;\nthey also judged these reported web-based doctors’ answers as\nmore unacceptable responses to patients. ChatGPT’s responses\nwere rated as “good” or “very good” nearly 4 times more often\nthan those written by the reported web-based doctors, and\nChatGPT’s responses were rated as almost 10 times more\nempathic than those by the reported web-based doctors. At the\nother end of the scale, these web-based physicians’replies were\nperceived to lack empathy approximately 5 times more often\nthan responses produced by ChatGPT.\nLimitations of Generative AI\nDespite their potential, LLMs have multiple limitations. The\nnature of the data sets the models are trained on is critical, as it\nwill determine the scope and nature of responses possible. Of\nspecial relevance here, none of the easily accessible LLMs have\nyet been trained on medical texts and thus lack the core substrate\nto generate the most appropriate responses. Any bias in the\nsource the models are trained on will also be reflected in answers\nor text provided. Thus, while a study in March 2023 showed\nthat ChatGPT (version 3) Could pass the United States Medical\nLicensing Examination [52], the authors of the study noted that\nto truly assess the potential of such LLMs, there is a need for\n“controlled and real-world learning scenarios with students\nacross the engagement and knowledge spectrum.” Still, the\nresults of that study were acknowledged by the American\nMedical Association, which noted that it intends to begin\nconsidering how tools such as ChatGPT need to be incorporated\ninto the education process [53].\nIndeed, the full extent to which LLMs embed discriminatory\nbiases has not been fully explored. However, it would be\nsurprising if these models did not replicate many of the same\nbiases that already exist in clinical research, and consequently\nmedical education, in part because of the underrecruitment of\nwomen, racial and ethnic minorities, and older people. Such\nskewing is already recognized as a source of disparity with the\npotential to perpetuate errors or misjudgments in clinical\ndecisions [54-58]. Studies suggest that gender and racial biases\nare indeed coded into LLMs [59]. It remains unknown whether\nthe potential for such discriminatory errors might prove worse\nthan today with standard human-mediated care; however, some\npreliminary research suggests that negative stereotyping may\nbe compounded by LLMs [60].\nAnother concern is the lack of consistency in responses proffered\nby LLMs. Inputting the same question to GPT-4, for example,\nrarely elicits the same response. Of course, human responses\nare rarely consistent as well; however, the extent to which\ngenerative AI, relying on LLMs, offers the same level of reliable\noutputs is uncertain. This is a particular concern given that\nLLMs are prone to yield falsehoods—a phenomenon referred\nto as “hallucination.” Moreover, the persuasive conversational\ntone of LLMs such as GPT-4 means that narrative responses\nmay appear compelling but factually incorrect.\nThe extent to which doctors may already be adopting generative\nAI tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is not yet known. In the\nUnited States, under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPAA), which established national\nstandards in the United States to protect patients’ health\nJMIR Med Educ 2024 | vol. 10 | e51183 | p. 4https://mededu.jmir.org/2024/1/e51183\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBlease et alJMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\ninformation from being shared by “covered entities”—that is,\nproviders—to other third parties. Therefore, the use of OpenAI,\nfor example, is precluded under the HIPAA. At the time of\nwriting, in the most common use cases, uploading patient details\nto versions of generative AI would breach patient trust and\nmedical confidentiality due to privacy concerns.\nHowever, the scope for this is quickly changing. Epic—the US\nsoftware giant which has an estimated 78% of the share of\nhospital medical record use in the United States [61]—is\ncurrently piloting the integration of HIPAA-compliant GPT\nservices [62]. In addition, an Azure HIPAA–compliant GPT-4\nservice already exists [63]. Voice-to-text clinical note generation\nproducts now represent a growing space in health care. For\nexample, a new app called Ambient Experience from Nuance\ncan listen to the physician’s conversation and, using ChatGPT\n(version 4), help create the clinical note that is ready for\nphysicians to review [64]. In the United States, such capacities\nare set to become embedded into electronic health systems,\nsignaling revolutionary changes in medical documentation\npractices.\nClinicians and Computers as Coauthors\nCombined, the aforementioned discourse suggests that LLMs\nare far from ready to disintermediate clinicians when it comes\nto writing clinical notes. We argue that the innovation will play\na key role if humans are involved. Thus, this promise could be\nharnessed if clinicians oversee the cocreation of clinical\ndocumentation. In this scenario, LLMs might offer initial draft\ndocumentation, which, crucially, should be supervised, and\nedited by clinicians whose key role in documentation will be\nto keep a check and balance on the current limitations with these\nmodels.\nConsidering the scope of generative AI, we therefore propose\nthat current training interventions might be constructively\nadapted to better prepare clinicians to oversee the writing of\npatient-facing clinical documentation, for example, by editing\nand checking the quality of clinical information constructed by\ngenerative AI and reviewing the sensitivity of the language\nused. Preliminary studies already show that when humans\ncollaborate with LLMs to coproduce replies to patients, this can\nenhance patients’ ratings of levels of empathy compared with\nhuman-only produced responses [65]. Such partnership could\noffer a more robust and safe form of documentation quality\ncontrol—one that could potentially avoid the work burdens\nassociated with documentation burdens and, therefore, the\npotential for burnout from ORA. We emphasize, however, that\ntraining should reinforce the importance of using generative AI\nas an assistant narrative scribe and not as a substitute for writing\nnotes.\nFurthermore, if health systems adopt this approach, we suggest\nthat 2 (or even multiple) versions of clinical documentation may\nbe feasible. Using LLMs, there is scope to not only a complete\nmedical narrative pitched at the level of the domain expert or\nspecialist, but also to document notes couched at the level of\nhealth literacy, language, and empathy of the individual patient\nwho might be reading them. This could help overcome the\ncurrent dilemma of documenting information in a way that is\naccessible for patients, but which does not diminish the clinical\ndetail for health professionals.\nFuture Research Directions\nMany research questions could usefully explore generative AI\nin cowriting clinical notes, especially dual-purpose\ndocumentation for both patients and clinicians. We suggest a\nfew novel directions. First, qualitative studies could usefully\nexplore how successfully generative AI translates clinical\ndocumentation into patient-friendly language. For example,\nstudies could examine the accuracy and fidelity of generative\nAI in translating acronyms or other medical jargon, as well as\nthe understandability of the notes, and the level of empathy\nembedded in patient-facing documentation. Second,\nexperimental studies could probe whether documentation\nembeds biases or a higher likelihood of containing stigmatizing\nlanguage for different patient demographics or health conditions.\nThird, pilot studies could help determine the satisfaction and\nadministrative work burden of dual documentation among\nclinicians.\nConclusions\nGenerative AI is ready for mass use when it comes to writing\nor cowriting clinical notes, and its potential is enormous. We\nemphasize, however, that there remain evidence-based risks\nassociated with existing generative AI, which relate to\ninconsistencies, errors, and hallucinations and the real potential\nto embed harmful biases in documentation. If carefully\nimplemented, in the long term, doctors who write documentation\nusing generative AI may do a better job of adapting to the\nevolving functionality of the electronic records than doctors\nwho do not. This adoption may address the potential risk of\n“dumbing down” clinical documentation while conveying\nunderstandable and empathetic information to patients using\nplain and sensitive language. We also forecast that doctors who\ncowrite their documentation with LLMs will experience fewer\nwork burdens.\nConflicts of Interest\nJT is the Editor-in-Chief of JMIR Mental Health.
