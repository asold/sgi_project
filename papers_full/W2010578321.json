    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, high‐repetition‐rate pulsed power generators using a magnetic pulse compression circuit (MPC) and semiconductor switches have been developed. We have developed a new all‐solid‐state pulsed power generator for use with a high‐repetition‐rate excimer laser and in an ozonizer. The all‐solid‐state generator consists of a semiconductor switch and an MPC with saturable inductors (SI) and a saturable transformer (ST). The semiconductor switch is a high‐speed gate‐turn‐off (GTO) thyristor. The switching speed of the GTO thyristor was improved, decreasing the switching loss. The ST with an Fe‐based nanocrystalline magnetic core has two functions, those of step‐up transformer and magnetic switch. The high‐speed GTO thyristor and the new MPC can be used to realize a high‐performance, simple all‐solid‐state pulsed power generator. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
