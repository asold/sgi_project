    "abstract": "Nowadays, transformers are made of conventional magnetic cores which are constructed of a single grainoriented or amorphous, magnetic steel. Even though, the transformer is the most efficient of electrical machines, with efficiencies typically above 90%, it is possible to improve transformer performance by using composite magnetic cores. Patents related to this simple and effective technique can be traced back to 1929. The specific technique can be applied to wound core distribution transformers. By using wound cores constructed with a combination of conventional and high permeability grain-oriented steel the total owing cost (TOC) of the transformer can be reduced effectively. This paper presents a brief review of patents on wound and composite magnetic cores and introduces a generalized technique for the determination of the optimum design variables of a new composite wound core design. Keywords: Composite magnetic cores, distribution transformers, finite element methods, grain-oriented steel, no load losses, optimization methods, total owing cost, wound cores",
