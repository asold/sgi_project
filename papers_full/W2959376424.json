In\nmany of these countries, over 50% of their population\nare under the age of 14 years (The World Bank,2016)\nwith a high percentage of children at risk of mental\nhealth and behavioural diﬃculties (Collins et al. 2011;\nKieling et al. 2011). Exposures that aﬀect brain develop-\nment and function are endemic in many of these settings\nand are likely to cause the high rates of behavioural dif-\nﬁculties seen (Rodríguez-Barranco et al. 2013).

The impact that these\nconditions can have on the functional abilities of chil-\ndren is often under-recognised, identiﬁed late and can\ngo untreated. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of\nmental health diﬃculties (globally) in adults originate\nearly in life, particularly externalising behaviour pro-\nblems (Merikangas et al. 2009). These children often\nhave diﬃculties with both cognition and self-control,\nwhich can manifest as disruptive behaviour (DB) in\nthe form of aggression, rule-breaking, hyperactivity or\ninattention.\nAlthough the epidemiology clearly demonstrates\nthese high rates of mental health and behavioural pro-\nblems in children, limited services provide support for\nthem (WHO, 2013). The Mental Health Atlas 2014\nshows almost a complete lack of data for the diagnosis\nand treatment for child mental health conditions in\nLMIC (WHO, 2014). Despite this, the WHO Mental\nHealth Action Plan 2013 –2020 highlights the dire\nneed for better mental health support in low-income\nsettings (WHO, 2013). The Mental Health Gap Action\nProgramme (mhGAP); launched by the WHO in 2016\nhas tried to address this with some pragmatic\napproaches to child mental health. This has brought\nan enhanced commitment by some countries to\nimprove the treatment and assessment of mental\nhealth and psychiatric conditions; including those for\nchildren (WHO,2008).\nIn order to implement programmes around child’s\nmental health and development, we need to be able\nto identify children with mental health disorders\nmore appropriately in a variety of diﬀerent cultural\nsettings. Much of the paucity of speciﬁc data on mental\nhealth and behavioural problems in children in LMIC\nsettings relates to the lack of tools, which can identify\nand assess behaviour in these settings. The use of a\nwide variety of often, not well-validated tools, can\nalso lead to a lack of compatibility between studies.\nIn recent years, the global mental health community\nhas tried to promote research on ensuring that tools\nfor assessing mental health and neurodevelopment in\nchildren are validated for the particular cultures and\nsettings they are used in (Collinset al. 2011; Kieling\net al. 2011). There are presently no guides provided\nby this wider mental health community as to which\ntools to use for this purpose.\nMental health issues in children can be classiﬁed as\ninternalising or externalising, depending on the symp-\ntoms that are presented (Achenbach & Edelbrock,\n1978). We can deﬁne externalising behaviour problems\nor disorders where behavioural symptoms cause the\nchild to act negatively on the external environment,\ni.e. symptoms seen by those around patients. This\ngroup of behavioural problems includes but it is not\nlimited to, uncontrolled aggressive conduct disorders,\ndisruptive behaviour, attention de ﬁcit hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD) (Huesmannet al. 1987).\nIn contrast, children may develop internalising\nbehavioural problems that aﬀect the child’s internal\npsychological environment rather than the external\nsurroundings. These problems include anxiety and\ndepressive symptoms. The distinction between the\ntwo categories is not perfect and the two overlap. A\nchild’s internalising behavioural problems can have a\nnegative impact on other people around them and a\nchild’s externalising behaviour problems can have\ninternal psychological implications. The distinction is\nuseful clinically in considering treatments for children.\nResearch studies have also demonstrated the longitu-\ndinal nature of these conditions with children who\nhave conduct disorders more likely to grow up to be\nviolent as adults and children with internalising\nbehavioural problems more likely to develop\ndepression in the future (Fryers & Brugha, 2013).\nClinically, it is vital that children who are being\nassessed for behavioural diﬃculties should be assessed\nfor both externalising and internalising problems.\nFurthermore, mental health assessments should aim\nto explore dimensional psychological constructs that\nare relevant to human behaviour and mental disorders.\nThe Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) recommended\nthe use of multiple methodologies for assessing chil-\ndren and that we also take into account developmental\ntrajectories and environmental in ﬂuences alongside\nour assessment (Inselet al. 2010).\nIn high-income countries, mental health practi-\ntioners will often use tools to provide information on\nthe presence and severity of behaviours. These tools\nare varied and can include questionnaires or checklists\nthat provide information on the internalising and\nexternalising characteristics or behaviours of an indi-\nvidual child. Mental health practitioners may ask par-\nent or teachers to report on behaviours through the use\nof these tools and in some cases, they are observa-\ntional. Often practitioners use them to provide infor-\nmation to enable diagnostic labels to be given to\nsome children. Common examples include The\nAchenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL)\n(Achenbach, 1991, 2009), the Conners’ Rating Scales\n(Conners et al . 1998), the Behaviour Assessment\nSystem for Children (BASC) (Reynolds & Kamphaus,\n2015). Widely used screening tools include the\nStrengths and Di ﬃculties Questionnaire (SDQ)\n(Goodman, 1997), the Survey of Well-Being of Young\nChildren (SWYC) (Sheldrick et al. 2012) or the Ages\nand Stages Socio-emotional screener (Squires et al.\n1997). This behavioural screening tool for 3–16 year\nolds includes 25 items that aims to screen for emotional\nsymptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer\nglobal mental health\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2019.11 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nrelationships and prosocial behaviour (Goodman,\n1997;M .et al. 2008). The SDQ has now been translated\nand validated for over 40 countries. Many of these are,\nalthough not exclusively, from high-income settings\n(Stone et al. 2010). Despite the widespread use of\nthese measures for screening and assessment of behav-\nioural problems, many of these tools reﬂect a psycho-\nlogical literature that is derived largely from Western\nindustrialised societies (Henrich et al . 2010).\nPresently, there is little information on the variety\nand robustness of tools created or adapted to screen\nor support assessment of externalising behaviour pro-\nblems in LMIC.\nPrevious research on externalising behaviour pro-\nblems have associated high prevalence of these mental\nhealth problems with academic under achievement\nand unemployment in a population (Tayloret al. 1996;\nFergusson & Horwood, 1998; Fergusson &\nWoodward, 2002). In the context of LMIC, this is of\nhigh importance as the negative cycle of poverty and\nmental ill health is well established, and children, par-\nticularly those with externalising behaviour problems\nare likely to be a substantial economic and social burden.\nExternalising behaviour problems respond well to early\nintervention, but further epidemiological data is essen-\ntial to inform policy and encourage future actions. To\nstudy the prevalence of these problems in LMIC, cultur-\nally appropriate and accurate tools are necessary.\nExperts recommend that practitioners or researchers\nshould ensure adequate cultural adaptation at linguis-\ntic and conceptual levels to ensure accurate screening\nand assessment (Guillemin et al. 1993). Developing a\nnew tool for a particular setting can require a high\nlevel of expertise and can be resource intensive.\nMany researchers, therefore, resort to adapting existing\nwell-known tools for their studies. This can be prob-\nlematic and may lead to bias within studies.Table 1\nsummarises possible scenarios when some form of\ncross-cultural adaptations may be required within\nresearch studies in LMIC settings.\nThere are few studies or reviews which provide\ngood information on the variety of tools used for asses-\nsing externalising behavioural problems in LMIC set-\ntings and none which provide good information on\nthe procedures undertaken to validate tools used\nwithin these settings. Without this information, it is\ndiﬃcult for researchers to know what is out there,\navailable and of good quality for use. This structured\nsystematic review aims to address this gap and to\nsearch the current literature to identify tools which\nassess or screen for externalising behaviour problems\nin children and young people under the age of 19 in\nLMIC settings. We are particularly focussing on exter-\nnalising behavioural problems as they can be particu-\nlarly problematic for families and communities in\nlow and middle-income settings. Furthermore, we felt\nthat focussing on one speciﬁc area of behavioural diﬃ-\nculties in children would be most helpful for theﬁeld.\nOur secondary objective is to understand how these\ntools have been adapted and validated, if at all, toﬁt\nwith the cultural settings of populations other than\nthose in Western industrialised settings.\nMethodology\nWe report this review according to the PRISMA guide-\nlines for reporting systematic review (Liberati et al.\n2009).\nWe deﬁned externalising behaviour or externalising\nbehaviour problemsas problems or disorders that overall\nreﬂ\nect the child negatively acting on the external envir-\nonment, i.e. symptoms seen by those around patients.\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\nWe included all studies that reported on the use of a\nmeasurement tool to identify children and adolescents\nunder the age of 19 years with externalising behaviour\nproblems. We included studies that used tools that\nwere more general and identi ﬁed children with a\nTable 1.

We discussed any articles where researchers\ndid not clearly deﬁne externalising behaviour, prior\nto making a decision as to whether to keep the article\nin. We included all articles published in either\nEnglish, Spanish or Portuguese between 1990 to\nSeptember 2018. There were no limitations on study\ndesign or publication type imposed to ensure an\nadequate number of studies identiﬁed. To be more spe-\nciﬁc in our search for studies that were identifying chil-\ndren with externalising behaviour problems, we\nexcluded studies that exclusively explored internalis-\ning behavioural such as depression or post-traumatic\nstress disorder. Studies that looked at externalising\nbehaviour using teacher, parent-report or self-\nreporting were included in the review.\nWe kept our search broad, to begin with and\nsearched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and\nthe Cochrane Library and included conference pro-\nceedings. We searched using the following terms;\n‘externalising behaviour’ AND ‘behaviour problem’\nAND ‘child’ AND ‘developing country’ OR ‘low and\nmiddle income country’ OR the name of each LMIC,\nas de ﬁned by World Bank 2016 (online\nSupplementary File 1).\nWe discussed the proposed search strategy with dif-\nferent experts working on this topic prior to starting\nthe search. To identify any unpublished or ongoing\nstudies, we contacted individual researchers working\nin the ﬁeld. We reviewed reference lists from all\nincluded studies and articles were included when\nappropriate. The PRISMA ﬂow diagram is shown in\nFig. 1.\nSelection of studies\nWe imported search results into EPPI-Reviewer soft-\nware to remove duplicates and screen by title and\nabstract. Title and abstract screening was performed\nby two independent reviewers (MG and BNM), with\nconsensus decision in cases of disagreement. We then\nretrieved full texts and re-assessed against inclusion\ncriteria. Two reviewers scrutinised the full text of all\nstudies, which passed title and abstract. Any disagree-\nments about ﬁnal inclusion were resolved by a third\nreviewer (JC). We scrutinised publications for dupli-\ncate data. We list studies excluded after full-text assess-\nment and their reason for exclusion in online\nSupplementary File 2.\nExtracted data\nWe developed a study characteristic form to extract the\nrelevant data from selected studies and gathered gen-\neral information on; author(s), country of setting,\ntheir purpose, participant’s age group, tool used and\nwhether researchers had adapted or validated the\ntool in any way. We included any studies that also\naimed to validate a tool in a new setting. The section\nFig. 1.

The model aims to identify the crit-\nical elements in cultural adaptation and has been pre-\nviously used to assess tools used to screen for autism\n(Maskari et al. 2018). The EVF model has eight compo-\nnents: language, metaphors, person, contents, con-\ncepts, methods, goals and context. To facilitate data\nextraction and standardise the process, questions\nwere developed for each domain with a Yes (+) or\nNo (−) answer (Table 2)\nResults\nNumber of articles found\nThe database search yielded 11 226 citations (Fig. 1). In\ntotal 3206 studies were duplicates and were removed\nleaving 7406 paper titles and abstracts to be scruti-\nnised. A total of 346 abstracts were selected after this\nprocess. In total 338 were full-text articles retrieved\nfor eligibility assessment against the inclusion criteria;\nfull text was not available for eight papers. Overall, 82\narticles were included as part of this review (Table 3).\nCountries of origin\nWe found over 50 LMICs that were measuring externa-\nlising behaviour using a questionnaire-based approach\n(Table 5). This included settings in Africa (Sudan,\nSouth Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Democratic Republic\nCongo, Uganda, Zambia, Sierra Leone and Ethiopia),\nAsia (Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka,\nBangladesh, Nepal, Vietnam, Afghanistan), Middle\nEast (Iran, Turkey, Palestine, Egypt), Central and\nSouth America (Brazil, Jamaica, Panama, Mexico) and\nEurope (Ukraine and Romania). In addition, areas\nthat have been recently subjected to con ﬂict and\nhumanitarian emergencies such as the Gaza strip\n(Thabet et al. 2000) and Kosovo (Shahini et al. 2015)\nwere also using tools in studies. Most published\nresearch on externalising child behaviour in LMICs ori-\nginated from the African region, compared to Asia,\nMiddle East and South and Central America.\nTypes of study\nMost studies included in the review were cross-\nsectional studies providing a one-point snapshot of\nthe prevalence of externalising behaviour. The tools\nused were variable and conclusions about children\nhaving externalsing behaviour symptoms or features\nof ADHD sometimes came only from the use of\nscreenng tools such as the SDQ. This included a\nstudy in Nepal where the SDQ was used to identify\nchildren with behavioural di ﬃculties in order to\nmeasure prevalence rates of ADHD among school chil-\ndren. The studies we found were quite variable with\ndata collected in some cases, only from the child, in\nother studies, only from the parent and in other stud-\nies, only from teachers. This included a study in\nZambia, which examined prevalence of child behav-\nioural problems in HIV-positive adolescents by only\nusing the youth- report version of the SDQ (Menon\net al. 2007). Some studies, such as that in Palestine,\nused both parent and teacher-reported Arabic SDQ\nscores to establish the prevalence of externalising\nbehaviour (Thabet et al. 2000). A minority of studies\nspeciﬁcally aimed to evaluate the psychometric prop-\nerties of the tools that they were using. This included\na study in Kenya that translated and adapted the\nCBCL and then evaluated its validity and reliability\nprior to use (Kariuki et al. 2016) and a study in in\nPakistan which speciﬁcally aimed to translate and val-\nidate the SDQ for children between 4 and 16-years-old\n(Samad et al. 2005\n). Some studies were more speciﬁc-\nally using assessment tools to evaluate the impact of\nan intervention. A study in Turkey looked at the eﬀect\nof zinc sulphate as an ADHD treatment and used the\nDu Paul Parents Rating of ADHD, the Attention\nTable 2.

It is of note, however,\nthat the adaptation and validation of the CBCL was\ndiﬀerent in each setting with some studies describing\nexhaustive adaption and others not mentioning any\nchanges at all. For example, a study in South Africa\nSipsma et al.( 2013), performed translations and back-\ntranslations, expert review and a pilot to validate a\ntool whereas a study in India exploring behaviour dys-\nfunction in children used the CBCL with absolutely no\ndetails about its adaptation and validation for use in\nIndia (Prasadet al. 2014).\nSome studies we found described the development\nof a new tool speciﬁcally for their population. The\nChild Behaviour Assessment Instrument (CBAI) is\none example. It has been developed in Sri Lanka to\nscreen young children at risk of behaviour problems\n(Samarakkody et al. 2010). This instrument was devel-\noped following a literature review and multiple\nreviews by expert panels and was found to be valid\nand reliable for its purpose (Cronbach ’s α = 0.7).\nSimilarly, Betancourtet al.( 2010), developed and vali-\ndated the Oxford Measure of Psychosocial Adjustment\nto be used to investigate the course of internalising and\nexternalising behaviour problems amongst former\nchild soldiers in Sierra Leone. Aﬁnal example is the\nIndependent Behaviour Assessment Scale (IBAS),\nwhich was constructed in Bangladesh through an eco-\nlogical analysis of behaviours expected of children liv-\ning in both rural and urban settings. The tool was then\nvalidated through a prior to ensure validity and reli-\nability (Munir & Mcconuchie,1999).\nAdaptation and validation of tools\nOnly one out of the 84 studies mentioned the use of the\nsix stages recommended by the International Test\nCommission Guidelines for test translation and adap-\ntation (Bartram & Muniz, 2016). Studies which do\ndescribe some type of adaptation procedure are high-\nlighted in Table 4. At least half (46/84) of the studies\nmade reference to adaptations or validation to justify\nthe use of the tool in the setting. In some cases, a\nstudy mentioned the use of a validated tool for that set-\nting but do not explain how it was validated (Emam,\n2012; Matijasevichet al. 2014). Only ten of the 84 stud-\nies included in the review measured reliability in some\nway with most using a statistical measure such as\nCronbach’s α (to measure internal consistency) or\ntest-retest reliability. Internal consistency will demon-\nstrate how related the items are within the tool in its\ntranslated form when used to assess children in that\nsetting (Al-Awad & Sonuga-Barke, 2002; Erdogan\net al\n. 2008; Panter-Brick et al. 2009; Sánchez et al.\n2011; Perera et al. 2012; Pires et al. 2012; Abdul Kadir\net al. 2015; Shahiniet al. 2015). Some studies evaluated\nthe reliability of the tool to produce consistent results\nTable 5 (cont.)\nAssessment Tool Countries used Age of children\nSDQ Malaysia 14 –20\nJamaica 3 –6 years, 6 years\nVietnam 6 –16 years\nChina 2 –3 years\nRomania 5 –11 years\nRussia 6 –17 years\nBangladesh 5 years\nSouth Africa\nZambia 11 –15 years\nAfghanistan 5 –16 years\nNepal 11 –17 years\nPakistan 4 –16 years, 5–12 years\nGaza 3 –16 years\nPalestine 6 –15 years\nSutter-Eyberg Student Behavior Inventory (SESBI)– Teacher report Jamaica 3 –6 years\nSwanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) Brazil 6 –16 years\nglobal mental health\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2019.11 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nby measuring test-retest reliability (Al-Awad &\nSonuga-Barke, 2002; Erdogan et al. 2008; Perera et al.\n2012; Albores-Gallo et al. 2016). In addition, many\nresearchers also explored the external validity and\ncross-cultural invariance that their ﬁndings had by\ncomparing the prevalence of behavioural problems to\nthose reported in similar settings.\nWe examined cultural adaptation of the tools used\nthrough the Ecological Validity Framework (Table 3).\nAll versions of screening questionnaires used declared\nthe use of appropriate language obtained through\ntranslation and back translation process and input\nfrom experts in the ﬁeld. However, we found that\neﬀorts to consider the uniqueness of the culture to\nthe content of the tool or adapts psychological concepts\nto societal constructs were not reported. Many authors\nclaimed that they accounted for contextual features\nwithin the population they were studying comes\nfrom, although very rarely, did they disclose how\nthey did consider this.\nThose authors who developed new tools for use in\ntheir speciﬁc setting did fulﬁl the EVF and those that\ndid, reported on their adjustment in language, meta-\nphors, concepts and contents within their context.\nTwo good examples of this were; the INCLEN\nDiagnostic Tool for Attention De ﬁcit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (INDT-ADHD) (Mukherjee et al. 2014) and\nthe CBAI in Sri Lanka (Samarakkodyet al. 2010). In\nthe former, the team ensured that translators‘[main-\ntained] conceptual, content, semantic, operational and func-\ntional equivalence of the items’and in the latter, the team\nensured that they deﬁned behaviour problems through\na literature search after‘considering the social, economic,\nhistorical and political context’of their setting.\nDiscussion\nIdentifying children with behavioural problems, mak-\ning diagnoses, supporting and managing the symp-\ntoms that these children have is incredibly important\nfor the quality of life of children in LMIC. Without\nvalid cross-cultural assessment and screening tools,\nclinicians may not appropriately diagnose children\nwho need support. Similarly, researchers need to\nhave valid and reliable tools to conduct robust and\nwell-considered studies which provide better evidence\nboth in epidemiological and intervention-based\nresearch for children with externalising behavioural\nproblems in LMIC settings (Malhotra & Patra,2014).\nWe found a large number of studies focusing on\nexternalising behaviour in children and adolescents\nin LMIC. Despite this, researchers from LMIC settings\nstill seem to favour tools for screening and assessment\nof externalising behaviours created in Western indus-\ntrialised settings (Munir & Mcconuchie, 1999). This\nincludes the SDQ screening tool and tools that assess\nthe presence and severity of behaviours such as the\nCBCL and the Conners Rating Scales. Researchers\nmay not yet know about the new tools have been cre-\nated in LMIC settings and these tools may have not\nhad much endorsement from other experts in the\nﬁeld. Furthermore, our review of the literature demon-\nstrates how variable researchers can be in adapting or\nvalidating these tools for use in LMIC settings. We\nknow that in many LMIC cultures, children with exter-\nnalising disorders such as ADHD, are highly stigma-\ntized particularly where obedience and respect for\nelders are often considered paramount (Abubakar\net al. 2015). Identifying and supporting these children\nwithin a medical framework may be particularly help-\nful in some cases.\nOur study demonstrates that there is a clear need for\nresearchers working in LMIC settings to have tools\nwhich are both culturally appropriate and accurate\n(valid) for identifying the right kids with problems\nand furthermore, that are well-endorsed by others in\nthe ﬁeld as utilising good methods to demonstrate\ntheir validity. Although those working in global men-\ntal health recognise the importance of utilising tools\nwith good cross-cultural validity, very few robustly\nvalidated tools are available for use around the\nworld. Furthermore, the global mental health commu-\nnity has not yet endorsed or recommended any speciﬁc\ntools for use globally.\nOur systematic review of the literature has shown\nthat many researchers are using and have by using\nthem, demonstrate their acceptance of some of these\nWestern rating scales as being cross-culturally appro-\npriate. The SDQ and CBCL have been widely used\nand translated into multiple languages. Although,\nresearchers who have used tools such as the SDQ\nand CBCL claim to have ensured cross-cultural valid-\nity within their adapted (often just translated and\nback translated) versions, we would argue that the\nrealities and day-to-day life of children in diﬀerent set-\ntings might be quite diﬀerent. Researchers who are\nusing translated tools across settings may not always\nbe identifying the same things in diﬀerent places. For\nexample, researchers using the same Arabic version\nof a tool in both Palestine and Kuwait may get non-\ncomparable results as the life experiences of children\nliving in those two countries may be quite diﬀerent\nand therefore the way that parents answer the ques-\ntions as understood, may vary. Another example is\nthe use of the Spanish translation of the CBCL for a\nUS-Spanish context, which may be a very diﬀerent\ncontext to that in Central or South America\n(Rubio-Stipec et al. 1990; Ulloa et al. 2006). Although\nmany LMIC are using Western standards to diagnose\nexternalising behaviour using the DSM-V or ICD-10,\nglobal mental health\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2019.11 Published online by Cambridge University Press\noften with the support of externalising behaviour rat-\ning scales or checklists (Liu, 2004), it is clear that\nmore is needed to understand whether these tools\nare identifying children with similar features and con-\nstructs across countries. A number of studies have\ndemonstrated that norms, beliefs, values and expecta-\ntions of child behaviour in other parts of the world dif-\nfer from that in Euro-American cultures (Levine &\nNew, 2008; Kariuki et al. 2012; Mbuba et al. 2012;\nLancy, 2015) and need to be taken into account when\nmaking diagnoses.\nIn some settings, this has been taken into account\nprior to conducting a study using a tool. For example,\nin Algeria (Petot et al . 2011) and Brazil (Saur &\nLoureiro, 2015) tools have been ﬁrst adapted and\nthen validated linguistically before further research\nwas done. This process of adapting and validating an\ninstrument for use in a new setting set a precedence\nin these settings for further research including that,\nwhich provided estimates of the true impact of exter-\nnalising child behaviour problems in these popula-\ntions. We would, therefore, advocate, not only for\ntranslation of tools but also for adequate processes\nthat ensure the adaptation and contextualisation of\nthe tool for the setting the child is living in. The\nInternational Test Commission (ITC) guidelines for\nTranslating and Adapting tests is potential way of\nfacilitating the adaption and contextualisation of tools\nto be used in a new setting (Bartram & Muniz,2016).\nIn addition, as societies continue to evolve it may be\nimportant to revise adaptation of tools to ensure that\ntheir applicability and validity continues (Almaqrami\n& Shuwail,2004; Anwar,2010).\nMethodology of tool adaptation\nTools may be good at identifying problems in child\nbehaviour in one cultural setting but making sure\nthey are right for the speciﬁc setting can have a big\nimpact on the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of the tool.\nIn most studies in our systematic review, we found\nthat authors did not attempt adaptation or validation\nbut merely translate the tool from English to the local\nlanguage and then back-translated the tool to ensure\ntranslation was consistent and to ensure face validity.\nMany cross-cultural researchers have demonstrated\nhow semantic equivalence may not necessarily be\nmaintained if this is the limit of adaptation of a tool.\nThis is particularly important when assessing mental\nhealth and behavioural problems as the diagnosis is\nso descriptive and dependent on conceptual under-\nstandings of those around the patient.\nVery few researchers validated their tools to ensure\nthe results obtained were correctly reﬂective of the con-\nstruct being measured (externalising behaviour) in\ntheir setting (Table 3). Some researchers have assessed\ncontent validity through conducting a pilot study and\nconsulting with local experts on how questions were\ninterpreted (Pires et al. 2012). In one study, ‘expert\nhelp was provided to participants when completing\nthe questionnaires to ensure all items were understood’\n(Pal et al. 2011). Other researchers use cross-referencing\nto report on the internal and external consistency and\nreliability of tools by comparing their results on preva-\nlence of externalising behaviours to that of Western\npopulations. Many researchers solely justify their use\nof a tool based on a previous validation and focus\npurely on linguistic validity (Ashena ﬁ et al . 2001;\nDiGirolamo et al. 2010; Walker et al. 2010; Kariuki\net al. 2012). Furthermore, numerous authors have relied\non the validation of tools that were conducted over a\ndecade ago, not taking into account cultural changes\nthat can occur with development and globalisation.\nWe found that researchers were comfortable using\ntools validated by other groups without ensuring\nthey would serve their purpose, instead of working\non developing or adapting tools to be culturally appro-\npriate. Despite this, many researchers have used the\nSDQ, CBCL and Conners rating scales widely in the\nﬁeld providing some face validity. However, this\ndoes not mean that they should not be adapted, piloted\nand validate to ensure they are measuring the right\nconstruct of child behaviour for each setting where\nresearchers are studying child behaviour (Malhotra &\nPatra, 2014).\nThe International Test Commission has produced\nguidelines for Translating and Adapting Tests (2016)\ndetails how tool developers can translate and adapt\nnew tools. We would recommend a staged process to\ntranslate, adapt and validate foreign tools, using this\nguideline as a framework, before introducing them in\na new setting. This process should start by forward\nand back translating the content, then obtaining input\nfrom local experts in this area before running a pilot\nstudy putting this new tool into action. Following this\nadaptation process, a group of children with diﬀerent\ncharacteristics should be selected to validate the tool.\nFurthermore, to ensure good validity, researchers should\nassess content and construct validity of any newly\nadapted tool. A six-step process for cross-cultural adap-\ntation of self-report measures (Beatonet al. 2000)b a s e d\non a review of adaptation procedures across medical,\npsychological and sociological literature is summarised\nin Appendix 1. Ultimately, we would welcome research-\ners using such processes to create or adapt tools for use\nin speciﬁc settings.\nIn our study, we aimed to examine systematically\nthe cultural adaption of the tools using a framework\nto appraise against our ﬁndings. In doing so, we\nwere dependent on what the authors reported in\nglobal mental health\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2019.11 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ntheir papers. Although we know that culture can vary\nwithin a country particularly by ethnic group or socio-\neconomic status, we did not examine any high-income\ncountries where low-income minorities may have been\npresent. This would have been interesting but for this\nreview, we focussed on LMICs, as this is where the\nmental health inequalities are greatest. For this review,\navailable full texts published in both English and\nSpanish were included as one of the authors was a\nnative speaker of both languages. We were, therefore,\nable to include studies from South America, where\npublishers had not translated articles into English.\nOur review has identiﬁed a wide number of coun-\ntries in LMIC settings, which are conducting research\ninto externalising behaviour as well as a wide number\nof tools, which are used to screen and support diagno-\nses for these children (Table 2). We have evaluated the\nprocesses for adaption and validity of tools and rating\nscales used to assess externalising behaviour and have\ndemonstrated some examples of good practice. We\nwould advocate that more research be focussed on\ndetermining the reliability, validity and clinical eﬀect-\niveness of adapted tools compared to tools that are\nspeciﬁcally designed for Western target group. We\nwould also promote researchers considering carefully\nhow they could conduct studies to compare whether\ntools can work across countries to measure externalis-\ning behaviours in a similar way in order to compare\noutcomes in cross-country intervention studies.\nAlongside this, through reviews and consensus, we\nwould encourage the experts in the global mental\nhealth community to provide more clarity as to\nwhich and what tools have robust measures of validity\nin cross-cultural use and to share this more widely\nthrough open access platforms for researchers in\nLMIC settings to utilise. A good example of this is\nthe World Bank Toolkit, which provides a guide for\nresearchers and programme oﬃcers as to the validity\nand use of measures of early childhood development\nin LMIC settings (Fernaldet al. 2017).\nKey points\nWhat’s known:\nThe rate of mental health problems in children in low\nand middle-income settings is high (Keiling et al .\n2011). A substantial proportion of mental health diﬃ-\nculties (globally) in adults originate early in life, par-\nticularly externalising behaviour problems.\nWhat’s new:\nA wide number of LMIC countries are researching exter-\nnalising behaviour problems in children. Common\nbehavioural screening tools, checklists and rating\nscales are used in many settings but new and adapted\nmeasures of externalising behaviour have been\nvalidated in LMIC settings which may work across\ncountries.\nWhat’s clinically relevant:\nOur study provides evidence that there is a need for\nculturally appropriate tools for screening and assessing\nbehaviour in children in low income settings. It will be\nimportant for clinicians to check whether clear guide-\nlines have been used in adapting, translating and val-\nidating tools (or items from tools) for use in their\ncountry or setting. The global mental health commu-\nnity may want to consider whether an open access\nplatform providing information on the robustness\nand validity of diﬀerent tools could enable clinicians\nto choose tools best suited to their setting.\nSupplementary material\nThe supplementary material for this article can be\nfound athttps://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2019.11\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank John Langﬁtt for help-\ning with the review.
