  "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in generating personalized online advertisements (ads) tailored to specific personality traits, focusing on openness and neuroticism. We conducted a user study involving two tasks to understand the performance of LLM-generated ads compared to human-written ads in different online environments. Task 1 simulates a social media environment where users encounter ads while scrolling through their feed. Task 2 mimics a shopping website environment where users are presented with multiple sponsored products side-by-side. Our results indicate that LLM-generated ads targeting the openness trait positively impact user engagement and preferences, with performance comparable to human-written ads. Furthermore, in both scenarios, the overall effectiveness of LLM-generated ads was found to be similar to that of human-written ads, highlighting the potential of LLM-generated personalised content to rival traditional advertising methods with the added advantage of scalability. This study underscores the need for cautious consideration in the deployment of LLM-generated content at scale. While our findings confirm the scalability and potential effectiveness of LLM-generated content, there is an equally pressing concern about the ease with which it can be misused.",
