It is very difficult\nfor a single clinician to manage all areas of the disease;\nconsequently, a multidisciplinary approach is advocated,\ninvolving a team of health care professionals (HCPs). To reduce\nthe burden of MS, management strategies must be tailored to\nindividual patients and include multidisciplinary assessment,\nservices, rehabilitation, and appropriate treatment [2].\nImportant limitations of existing management strategies in\nchronic diseases such as MS are that clinical evaluation is\ncross-sectional at particular times, requiring patients to attend\nregular follow-up visits in MS clinics and comprehensive\nassessments to be undertaken. Ideally, this should happen at 6-\nor 12-month intervals, but even at this frequency, mild relapses\nand disease progression may go unreported. Although more\nfrequent personal consultation could improve disease\nmonitoring, this is probably precluded by time, cost, and\ngeographical constraints. Furthermore, with median survival\nbeing as high as 78.6 years in women with MS [3], patients\ncommonly require long-term, multidisciplinary care in both\nclinical and community settings [1,4]. Despite recent advances\nin MS care, the availability of expert medical and rehabilitation\nservices may be limited or such services may not be regularly\nprovided owing to a lack of health care reimbursement.\nFurthermore, many patients cannot access available services\nbecause of restricted mobility, fatigue, or travel costs [5-7]. The\nability of patients to attend multiple sessions of personalized\nrehabilitation for specific indications can be constrained by\nthese factors, and long in-patient stays, if necessary, are costly\nand not widely available. In brief, there are significant\nimplications for patients, their caregivers, and physicians in\nterms of access to, and provision of, MS health care services\n[1,4].\nElectronic health (eHealth) may help to address some of these\nissues. It has been defined as “an emerging field in the\nintersection of medical informatics, public health and business,\nreferring to health services and information delivered or\nenhanced through the Internet and related technologies” [8]. As\na subcategory of eHealth, telehealth is of particular note and is\ndefined as “the use of information and communication\ntechnologies as a medium for the provision of rehabilitation\nservices to sites or patients who are at a distance from the\nprovider” [1]. eHealth technologies can improve access to health\ncare resources and information by reducing barriers of distance,\ntime, and cost; they can also be deployed to educate and support\npatients and caregivers in ongoing self-management and to\nempower patients to become more actively involved in the\nmanagement and treatment of their disease (Figure 1) [1,9].\nAmong these, it may be some time before technologies for\nremote self-monitoring of blood markers in MS are available,\nbut they would be useful. For example, blood tests to monitor\ndisease status in MS form an increasingly important part of\ndisease management, with a requirement for fortnightly\nmonitoring of liver enzyme levels in patients with MS taking\nteriflunomide. From a service-provider perspective, adoption\nof such technologies may lead to more efficient use of resources\nand clinic time, and provide opportunities for monitoring\ninterventions, tracking adverse events, and optimizing therapy\nthat would not be possible with traditional face-to-face\napproaches alone [1,9].\nMany eHealth solutions have been shown to be effective in\nimproving outcomes, in facilitating remote monitoring of\nsymptoms, and in increasing patient engagement, treatment\nadherence, and access to services and information in chronic\ndiseases such as type 1 diabetes [10] and asthma [11], and in\nneurological conditions including Parkinson disease [12],\nsuggesting that they may also be effective in MS. Furthermore,\nby generating prospective, longitudinal, real-world data, eHealth\nsolutions may yield valuable insights into MS disease\nprogression, such as symptoms indicative of relapse. This could\nalso facilitate characterization of different MS disease\nphenotypes that have been reclassified in recent years to take\naccount of observable active disease [13]. Characterizing a\npatient’s MS phenotype correctly is crucial, as it impacts directly\non decision making regarding treatment.\nOpportunities to deploy eHealth have increased significantly\nin recent years, largely owing to technological advances in\nmobile communications. For example, at the start of 2017, more\nthan half of the world’s population was using smartphones,\nnearly two-thirds of the world’s population possessed mobile\nphones, and more than half of the world’s Web traffic came\nfrom mobile phones [14], meaning that many people now have\nthe opportunity to engage with eHealth solutions. A high level\nof Internet usage among patients with MS has been reported; a\nsurvey in 2011 of more than 8500 patients with MS in North\nAmerica and Canada noted that about 90% of those who\nresponded had access to the Internet or email, and about\ntwo-thirds used these at least once daily [15]. Although the\nsituation is unclear among MS physicians specifically, surveys\nin 2010 and 2013 highlighted a dramatic increase in social media\nusage from 42% [16] to 75% [17] among practicing physicians\nin general. Ostensibly, both patients and physicians would seem\nreceptive to the adoption of eHealth solutions.\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 2http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nFigure 1. Electronic health (eHealth) technologies and health care. HCP: health care professional.\nAlthough the definition of eHealth can include traditional\ntelephone use, our review will focus on more recent technologies\n[18] such as the Internet, mobile devices, and apps. The digital\nand remote technologies developed for individuals with MS\nthat are identified and discussed here pertain to one of four\ncategories: screening and assessment, disease monitoring and\nself-management, treatment and rehabilitation, and advice and\neducation. There are some overlaps among these four groupings,\nbut they serve to simplify the task of assessing the eHealth\nlandscape and also align broadly with categories used in a recent\ncomprehensive review examining these technologies in a range\nof clinical conditions [19]. We provide a narrative synthesis of\npreviously published information obtained through a targeted\nliterature search and informed by our personal experience and\ndescribe various eHealth solutions, summarizing the clinical\nevidence supporting their feasibility and use in patients with\nMS. This review presents a broad perspective on eHealth, a\nfast-developing field, providing a useful resource to stimulate\nimproved multidisciplinary research projects and services. It\nwill aid HCPs who are interested in integrating eHealth solutions\nwithin their clinical practice, offering patients a convenient\nsummary of technologies that have been evaluated clinically,\nand perhaps helping those developing eHealth solutions in MS\nto broaden their knowledge of the field. Moreover, the review\nhighlights the need for evaluation of eHealth solutions in MS\nboth in phase 3 clinical trials and in large patient cohorts in\nreal-world settings.\nScreening and Assessment\nFew studies have examined the use of digital technologies as\nMS screening or assessment tools, but they have demonstrated\nthat these technologies provide an efficient alternative to\ntraditional clinic-based methods and are sensitive to capturing\nimportant disease information (Table 1). The Multiple Sclerosis\nPerformance Test (MSPT) is a tablet-based app developed to\novercome the challenges associated with measuring MS-related\ndisability accurately [20]. The app builds on the assessments in\nthe MS Functional Composite instrument, tracking and\nproviding precise quantitative data on balance, walking speed,\nvisual function, manual dexterity, and cognitive\ninformation-processing speed [20]. These outcomes are\ncalculated automatically, and gathering such quantitative\nperformance data provides an opportunity to perform in-depth\npost-hoc analyses of performance patterns. For example, it is\npossible to gain insights about whether manual dexterity\nabnormalities are related to grasping, transporting, or releasing\n[21]. In a prospective clinical validation study that enrolled\n51 patients with MS and 49 healthy individuals, data captured\nwith the MSPT app compared favorably with those captured\nby technicians, and patients reported a high level of acceptance\nof the tool [20]. The MSPT can be distributed readily to\nnonexpert clinicians in rural settings and could be adapted for\nuse in patients’ homes, yielding valuable assessment data\ncollected by the patients themselves.\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 3http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nTable 1.

In\na prospective, mixed-methods study that included six\nneurologists (mean MS experience: 4.3 years) and six nurses\n(mean MS experience: 2.7 years), ASSESS MS was used to\nrecord a predefined set of standard movements in 51 patients\n[22]. The tool was found to be usable by, and acceptable to,\nboth patients and HCPs, and generated data of sufficient quality\nfor clinical analysis. The tool may also improve accuracy when\ndetermining the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score\n[26] by reducing subjectivity, for example, when rating tremor\nseverity during the finger-nose test. Like the MSPT, ASSESS\nMS is currently at an early stage of development and is used\nonly under the supervision of trained HCPs in a clinical setting,\nbut the potential exists for its adoption in remote eHealth apps.\nAlthough the physician-administered EDSS [26] is the current\ngold standard for monitoring MS disease severity [27], a\npatient-administered version could help to capture such data\nremotely in settings where patients cannot undergo regular\nphysician assessment [27]. With this in mind, a pilot study was\nconducted [27] that compared an Internet-based version of the\ntelephone-based EDSS [28] with the original\nphysician-administered EDSS [26]. Overall patient satisfaction\nwith the Web-based version was high, and results from it\ncorrelated well with those from the physician-administered\nversion [27]. Although further studies are needed to validate\nthe Internet-based tool, these findings suggest it will be\ninvaluable in future long-term monitoring of patients with MS\n[27].\nThe heterogeneous nature of MS can make it challenging to\nmeasure patients’ cognitive impairment, and it can be\ntime-consuming and expensive to conduct a full battery of\nneurocognitive tests. Accordingly, an MS-center study enrolled\n40 patients with clinically definite MS and subjective cognitive\ncomplaints [23] to examine whether cognitive function could\nbe measured remotely using the Internet-administered Cognitive\nStability Index (CSI) [24]. The study found the CSI to be as\nspecific as, and more sensitive than, other tools typically used\nto assess cognitive function in MS, including the\nneuropsychological battery of tests NPsych and the Paced\nAuditory Serial Addition Test [23].\nSphincter dysfunction is common in MS [29], but bladder and\nbowel incontinence can be underreported and poorly managed\n[25,30]. Furthermore, the use of existing continence-screening\ntools may be limited in practice by time constraints and\nphysician workload [25]. To address these issues, a\ncross-platform tool (Tablet-based Data capture in Multiple\nSclerosis, TaDiMuS) was developed for use by patients on a\ntablet computer [25]. In a pilot study, 157 patients completed\nthe TaDiMuS versions of the Bladder Control Scale and the\nBowel Control Scale from the MS Quality of Life Inventory\n[31] while waiting for their appointments (data were captured\nwirelessly from the waiting room). Scores of ≥2 on either\nquestionnaire generated an automated electronic referral to the\nclinic’s MS continence nurse [25]. The study confirmed the\nvalidity of TaDiMuS as a continence-screening tool, offering\nphysicians an efficient, sensitive, and feasible method of\nscreening patients for bladder and bowel dysfunction [25].\nDisease Monitoring and Self-Management\nMany tools have been developed to facilitate disease monitoring\nand self-management (Table 2). A major challenge facing\nphysicians and patients with MS is how to organize, integrate,\nand interpret medical data to track disease progression, predict\noutcomes, and personalize treatment [32]. Accordingly, the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, CA, USA developed\nMS BioScreen, a tablet-based navigation system that integrates\ndata from a patient’s medical records with population-based\ndata to inform physicians about their disease trajectory relative\nto reference populations and to guide the patient and physician\nin treatment decisions [32-34].\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 5http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nTable 2.

On the basis of MSDS,\nthe most widely used electronic documentation system in\nGermany, MSDS3D helps HCPs and patients plan, document,\nand share clinical data via touchscreen terminals and devices,\napps, or a Web browser [35]. Multidimensional data collected\nby patients and HCPs, including that relating to specific\ndisease-modifying therapies, can be integrated with that from\nMS registries to provide an innovative resource of long-term\nfollow-up data [36]. In an environment with many\ndisease-modifying therapies, the platform meets a need to\nmonitor clinical outcomes and connect diagnostic and\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 7http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\ntherapeutic processes, thus improving patient care and\nrepresenting an excellent resource for data mining [35,36].\nA separate tool, MSmonitor, is an interactive, Internet-based\nprogram for the self-monitoring, self-management, and\nintegrated multidisciplinary care of patients with MS [47]. The\noriginal content comprised (1) questionnaires to assess the\nimpact of MS and related quality of life (QoL), fatigue, anxiety,\nand depression; (2) inventories to capture medication, adherence,\nand urological symptom data; (3) diaries to record activity, rest\nperiods, micturition, and fluid intake; (4) an e-consult\nfunctionality to enable patients to contact their physician; and\n(5) an e-logbook [47]. Pilot data suggested that repeated use of\nMSmonitor led to an increase in health-related QoL and helped\npatients to self-manage fatigue [47]. In a subsequent survey of\n55 patients with MS, MSmonitor has been shown to improve\npatients’ insights into symptoms and disabilities and improve\nthe quality of nursing care they received [37].\nAmbulation is one aspect of physical disability on which the\nEDSS assessment focuses, particularly at advanced stages of\ndisease. Abnormalities in spatiotemporal parameters that affect\nwalking ability can present in the early stages of MS, and\nhabitual walking performance is sensitive to disease progression\nand correlates highly with clinical tests of walking capacity and\nwith EDSS score. As such, recording daily activity is considered\nimportant for tracking disability progression [48]. A pilot study\ntesting a portable activity-monitoring sensor, designed to gather\ndata on home-based, physical activity (PA) in 11 patients with\nMS, showed that a simple 3D accelerometer (move II) could\ntrack fluctuations in daily PA and also tracked disability changes\nbetter than EDSS scores [38]. If this finding can be reproduced\nin a larger group of patients, it may be possible to use the\naccelerometer to detect signs of worsening disability earlier\nthan when using standard in-clinic measures [38]. Similarly, a\nstudy performed in eight patients with MS has demonstrated\nhow data from wireless pressure sensors in patients’ shoes can\nbe combined with Web-based software and mobile technology\nto detect early signs of deterioration in gait, enabling physicians\nto intervene rapidly. Data collected were accessible to doctors,\npatients, and administrators via a Web app [49]. A further study\nalso demonstrated the feasibility of using accelerometers and a\nmultimedia platform to monitor walking function remotely in\n25 patients with MS (EDSS score 1.0-6.0) over 2 years and the\npotential of this approach to capture changes that may indicate\ndeterioration over time [50].\nTo improve the assessment of functional status in patients with\nMS, a new patient-reported rating scale, the Multiple Sclerosis\nRating Scale-Revised (MSRS-R), was developed, refined, and\nvalidated using the Web-based data platform, PatientsLikeMe\n[39,51]. The MSRS-R was developed to capture\ndisability-related information across a range of domains, rather\nthan focusing on ambulation alone. The MSRS-R exhibits\ndesirable psychometric properties and correlates with existing\nmeasures, with the advantage of being more concise than other\nmeasures and therefore less burdensome for the patient to\ncomplete. Potentially, the MSRS-R, in conjunction with\nPatientsLikeMe, could provide a valuable source of real-world\nevidence, encompassing demographic, social networking,\ntreatment, and symptom data [39].\nMany apps have been developed to support MS symptom\nmonitoring and disease tracking, but, to date, few have been\nthe subject of published studies. Relapses may not always be\ntracked because patients forget to report them or because they\nare not recorded in a patient’s notes. Underreporting of relapses\nmay mean that patients are not receiving the most appropriate\ntreatment, so an app has been developed to address this issue.\nThe Novartis SymTrac app helps to identify when relapses occur\nby prompting patients to monitor their symptoms and well-being\nover time, logging information that can be sent automatically\nto physicians as needed [40,52].\nThe MS Association of America developed the app My MS\nManager for storing medical information, tracking disease\nactivity, generating private reminders, and connecting patients\nwith physicians to share details of their progress [41]. The\nMSdialog app [53] is an Internet- and mobile-based app\ndesigned to capture remote data on clinical and patient-reported\noutcomes and on self-administration of interferon β-1a [42].\nData from the app are combined with information captured by\nRebiSmart, an adjustable electronic injection device [53,54].\nThe app allows patients to create their own health reports and\nshare the information with their physicians. It also tracks trends\nin treatment adherence and health, and has a reminder function\nfor medication administration and future appointments [53]. In\na 6-week pilot study evaluating the app, patients (n=42) found\nit easy to use and to be superior to their previous health-tracking\nmethods that were mostly handwritten [42].\nNonadherence to MS medications is common and is associated\nwith a number of costs, but monitoring adherence can be\nchallenging, time-consuming, and expensive [45,55]. In addition\nto the MSdialog app [53], the MSJournal app [43] and\nmyBETAapp [44] have been developed to help patients and\ncaregivers to track injections and injection-site history and to\nset reminder alerts for injections [43,44]. To test whether\ntelehealth technologies could help to monitor or modify\nadherence, a study examined adherence to weekly interferon\nβ-1a and daily vitamin D among patients randomized to routine\ncare or to the use of an MS-specific version of the Internet-based\nHome Automated Telemanagement (HAT) system (MS-HAT)\n[45]. For 6 months, 30 patients with MS randomized to\nMS-HAT received text or email reminders to administer\ninjections and a weekly probe asking when they had taken their\nvitamin D supplements [45]. Although, overall, no major\nimprovements in medication adherence were reported with the\nMS-HAT system versus routine care, 4 patients (two using\nMS-HAT and two on routine care) discontinued therapy and\ndid not alert their physicians to their decision: the MS-HAT\nsystem detected the discontinuations, allowing timely physician\nintervention.\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 8http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nTable 3.

Similarly, in the industry-sponsored\nMySupport program, which provides telephone, text, and\nwebsite access to patients prescribed interferon β-1a, a\nretrospective study of anonymized data from 604 patients in\nthe Republic of Ireland found an increased probability of patients\nusing MySupport remaining on treatment compared with a\ncontrol group of 2461 patients receiving routine care [46].\nTreatment and Rehabilitation\nVarious treatment and rehabilitation solutions are shown in\nTable 3. The Internet-based HAT system was designed for use\nin patients’homes to monitor symptoms and educate them about\ntheir condition [56]. It was also developed to provide\nstep-by-step instructions on how to follow a tailored exercise\nregimen, to monitor exercise compliance, and to adapt the\nexercise regimen based on performance [56]. A 12-week pilot\nstudy that enrolled 12 patients with MS provided a preliminary\ndemonstration of the feasibility of the HAT system and its\npotential for use on other devices such as tablets and mobile\nphones. Its ease of use and convenience were considered\nparticularly beneficial for patients who may be reluctant or\nunable to visit a physician frequently [56].\nThe use of other home-based technologies has been explored\nin a variety of MS rehabilitation settings, including Internet- or\ncomputer-assisted training to enhance cognitive performance\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 10http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\n[57,67], attention [58], and balance, posture, and strength [59].\nThe Memory, Attention, and Problem Solving Skills for Persons\nwith MS (MAPSS-MS) program is a computer-assisted cognitive\nrehabilitation intervention for enhancing cognitive function in\npatients with MS [57]. In the 8-week, single-blind, randomized\ncontrolled MAPSS-MS study involving 61 patients with MS,\nsignificant improvements in cognition were observed with the\nMAPSS-MS program, and it was found to be feasible to use\nand well accepted by patients [57]. COGNI-TRAcK, a\nself-administered cognitive training app, has also been shown\nto provide intensive and personalized cognitive rehabilitation\n[60,68]. In 16 patients with MS and cognitive impairment who\nunderwent an 8-week intervention at home, COGNI-TRAcK\nwas found to be highly usable, motivating, and well accepted\nby users [60]. COGNI-TRAcK was also evaluated in 28 patients\nwith MS and cognitive impairment to determine the effects of\nadaptive versus nonadaptive cognitive training. Adaptive\ntraining involved increasing or decreasing the difficulty level\nof an exercise based on whether a participant completed\npreceding exercises correctly. COGNI-TRAcK was shown to\nbe suitable for administering personalized training to patients\nwith cognitive impairment. It also demonstrated that an adaptive\nwork load is crucial for determining the effectiveness of\ncognitive treatment, with only patients in the adaptive group\nshowing improvements in cognitive function on study and at\n6-month follow-up [68].\nA double-blind, randomized controlled study has evaluated a\nhome-based computerized program for retraining attention\ndysfunction under the supervision of a caregiver in 102 patients\nwith relapsing-remitting MS [58]. Compared with nonspecific\ntraining, the attention-dysfunction-specific training resulted in\nsome improvements exclusively in tasks of sustained attention,\nalthough patient-reported outcomes did not reveal differences\nbetween the groups [58]. Balance was also shown to be\nimproved using the Internet-based program Home eTraining.\nIn a randomized controlled study that enrolled 18 patients with\nMS, eTraining demonstrated significant improvements in static\nand dynamic balance that were similar to those resulting from\nhippotherapy [59].\nHome-based technologies have also been used for Web-based\nphysiotherapy exercises [61,69], physical telerehabilitation [70],\nand physical-activity-targeted behavioral interventions [71,72].\nWeb Based Physio, developed by the University of Glasgow,\nGlasgow, United Kingdom, provides Web-based physiotherapy\nexercise programs personalized for individual patients with\nlong-term conditions including MS, with the aim of allowing\npatients to self-manage their condition [69]. The effectiveness\nof this individualized, Internet-based physiotherapy program\nwas evaluated in a 12-week randomized controlled pilot study\nin community-dwelling adults moderately affected by MS\n(EDSS score 5.0-6.5). Although there was no significant\ndifference in the primary outcome measure (timed 25-foot walk),\npatients found the website easy to use, convenient, and\nmotivating, and indicated a willingness to use it in the future.\nA fully powered, definitive randomized controlled trial is\nplanned to determine the tool’s effectiveness [61].\nAnother 12-week study assessed feasibility of use, patient\nacceptance, and magnitude of clinical benefit of home-based\nphysical telerehabilitation in 12 individuals with MS (75%,\n9/12, had self-reported moderate MS) who received a tailored\nrehabilitative exercise program [70]. Home-based physical\ntelerehabilitation was shown to significantly improve functional\noutcomes including walking and balance. Internet-delivered\nbehavioral interventions have also demonstrated an increase in\nactivity among patients with MS. A 3-month randomized\ncontrolled study evaluating an Internet-delivered and\ntheory-based behavioral intervention that was supplemented\nwith video coaching in 45 patients with MS showed a large\nincrease in PA after 12 weeks that was sustained over 3 months\n[72].\nComputer- or gaming-based systems, such as the Nintendo Wii\nFit console or Kinect motion sensor, may offer the potential for\ntelerehabilitation applications in patients with MS because\npatients enjoy these exercises and find them motivating [73].\nAlthough some of these applications have demonstrated\nsignificant beneficial effects, the results of others have been\nmixed. For example, the Nintendo Wii platform appears to\nstimulate the postural control system only in the frontal plane\nand not the sagittal plane [74]. Thus, although available games\nare beneficial in some settings, they will be more effective if\ntailored to the type and severity of impairments present in\nindividual patients with MS and adapted to offer\nInternet-assisted monitoring [74,75]. In general, the success of\nNintendo Wii or exergaming technologies in randomized\ncontrolled clinical studies has also been mixed [76-78], but in\na 24-week diffusion tensor imaging study, modifications in the\nmicrostructure of superior cerebellar peduncles were observed\nfollowing 12 weeks of Nintendo Wii balance-board training\n[79]. These changes correlated with clinical improvements in\nparticipants’ balance, suggesting that high-intensity,\ntask-oriented exercises could induce favorable, myelin-related\nmicrostructural changes in the brains of patients with MS [79].\nTo address the potential issue of patients performing their\nrehabilitation exercises incorrectly, a comprehensive system is\nin development that combines weekly face-to-face clinic\nsessions with remotely supervised exercise training at home,\nusing a Web-based platform and tracking tool that analyzes and\ncorrects patients’ positions in real time [80]. This tool is\ncurrently being validated, and preliminary results indicate that\nthe system can be used effectively by patients and HCPs [80].\nIn light of the success of telephone-administered interventions\nfor improving various MS-associated symptoms and QoL\n[81-85], several studies have examined (or will examine)\nwhether interactive telehealth interventions can improve\nMS-associated anxiety, cognitive function, mood, fatigue,\nimpact, pain, QoL, and sleep quality [62-64,86-90]. These\ninclude a Web-based self-help program (Deprexis) that combines\ncognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with mobile platform and\ndialog technology and has proven efficacy in treating depression\n[64,91]; an Internet-based CBT program (MS Invigor8)\nadministered with or without email support to help reduce\nfatigue symptoms [62,90]; MS-specific multimedia software\nthat delivers a meditation course designed to decrease anxiety,\ndepression, and fatigue, as well as improve quality of sleep and\nQoL [88]; the project Guidelines for Exercise in Multiple\nSclerosis, an interactive, guidelines-based exercise program\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 11http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\naimed at improving MS symptoms and QoL [63]; and physical\nexercise e-training programs that demonstrate positive and\nsignificant effects on muscle strength, lung function, and sports\nactivity, but not on QoL or fatigue [92,93]. Perhaps the most\nrobust of these studies was a 9-week randomized trial conducted\nin patients with MS who had self-reported depression symptoms\n(N=90) [64]. Patients received the intervention (Deprexis [91])\nor remained on a waiting list (control) for 9 weeks, and over\nthe course of the study, use of Deprexis significantly reduced\nBeck Depression Inventory scores, whereas scores increased in\nthe control group. These results highlight the utility of\nWeb-based intervention programs, especially for patients who\ncannot attend or do not like to participate in treatment sessions\nregularly [64].\nHome-based, but clinician-supervised, technologies have also\nbeen examined, such as the remotely supervised self- or\nproxy-administration protocol for home delivery of transcranial\ndirect current stimulation (tDCS) [65]. Across 192 supervised\ntreatment sessions, remotely supervised protocol adherence was\ngreater than that observed in clinic-based delivery studies.\nFurthermore, there were no reported discontinuations or adverse\neffects. Thus, remotely supervised tDCS could be used to expand\npatient access to this potential treatment option [65].\nAdvice and Education\nSeveral apps have been developed to provide advice and\neducation to individuals living with MS, including the MS\nBuddy app [94] and the MS self app, which, in addition to\nproviding MS-related information, can synchronize with Fitbit\ndevices (Table 4) [95].\nTable 4.

The system functionality was later expanded\nto include a self-monitoring and self-management component\nthat allowed patients to assess their MS symptoms and receive\ngraphical feedback and evaluate symptom changes to make\ndecisions about how to respond to them [97]. Apps that have\nbeen developed for disease monitoring or rehabilitation also\nprovide patient advice and support, including the My MS\nManager app [41] and Deprexis [91]. In addition, patients with\nlife-changing illnesses (including MS) who use Web-based,\nquantitative, personal research platforms such as PatientsLikeMe\nreport important benefits such as being able to learn more about\ntheir symptoms and understand potential side effects of their\ntreatment [51].\nDiscussion\nSummary\nThere has been a rapid increase in the development, testing, and\nuse of digital and remote communication technologies in MS\nin recent years, with numerous studies demonstrating the value\nof these tools. The MS eHealth solutions identified here (Figure\n2) mostly support disease monitoring, self-management,\ntreatment, and rehabilitation. A few of these also offer patient\nadvice and education, although apps have also been developed\nspecifically for this. Fewer technologies address screening and\nremote assessment, and it may be that this area has the greatest\nscope for the development of new tools in the future.\nPrincipal Findings\nOf the 28 eHealth solutions discussed here, 14 are Web-based\n(Computerized Specific Training, CSI, Deprexis, HAT, Home\neTraining, MAPSS-MS, MCCO, MSDS3D, MS-HAT,\nMSInvigor8, MSMonitor, MSRS-R, MySupport, and Web Based\nPhysio), and 11 are apps (COGNI-TRAcK, MS Bioscreen, MS\nBuddy, MSdialog, MS Journal, MSPT, MS self, MyBETAapp,\nMy MS Manager, SymTrac, and TaDiMuS). The remaining\nthree use home-based technologies found in games consoles\n(ASSESS MS and move II) or specialist equipment (Remote\ntDCS). Apps are more represented than other platforms among\nsolutions that relate to disease monitoring and self-management,\nand Web-based solutions account for more of the treatment and\nrehabilitation solutions than do apps. This trend probably reflects\nthe frequency of use (and hence portability) and data burden\n(and therefore bandwidth) associated with different solutions.\nAlthough the development of digital and remote communication\ntechnologies is welcome, their true value can be realized only\nif patients and physicians jointly engage with them. Despite the\nsolid evidence base demonstrating the success of\ntelephone-based interventions, many patients with MS do not\nreceive this relatively basic therapy. Thus, it may be helpful to\nunderstand what barriers impede delivery of telephone-based\nrehabilitation before attempts are made to roll out more\ntechnologically advanced telehealth solutions on a large scale.\nIt is likely that factors such as mobile Internet access, available\nbandwidth in remote geographical regions, and cost are all\nbarriers to global uptake of eHealth solutions and that other\nfactors such as availability of specialist clinicians and adaptation\nof established solutions to suit local situations (language and\ncultural and educational issues) will need to be overcome.\nIrrespective of the setting, it is likely that educational programs\nwill be needed as part of training within health care systems to\nhelp clinicians understand the value that various communication\ntechnologies could bring to routine patient assessment and to\nensure that any technologies that are adopted are applied with\nstandardized methods and reporting.\nEncouragingly, studies in patients with MS that have examined\nthe use and acceptance of communication technologies suggest\nthat adoption is unlikely to be a major issue; proportionally\nmore patients with MS than in the general population use the\nInternet in the United States [98], and the majority of German\npatients at MS specialist centers regularly use modern\ncommunication technologies and are happy to use them to\ncommunicate with their physicians and other HCPs, including\nMS nurses [99]. Notably, most patients participating in the\nNorth American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis\nRegistry (2011) reported that the Internet was their first source\nfor health information [15], and studies examining the browsing\nhabits of patients with MS show that the most-viewed topics\nrelated to understanding the disease and treatments [100].\nFinally, patients express high levels of satisfaction with home\ntelehealth monitoring [101] and have high levels of acceptance\nof systems such as MS-HAT [102], finding them easy to use\n[45].\nThere are aspects of these technologies with which patients are\nuncomfortable. Some patients were intimidated by the Nintendo\nWii Fit owing to concerns about falling, and some disliked\nexergaming feedback because it reminded them of their\nimpairments [103]. Furthermore, some were unsure how to use\na video game [73], so appropriate training is needed. Particular\nchallenges for those with MS using Web-based technologies\ninclude difficulties in reading website text, problems with\nflashing or moving objects, and operation of a mouse or\nkeyboard because of dexterity issues [96]. Patients can also be\nunaware of accessibility features that facilitate navigation of\nwebsites [96]. Finally, patients may dislike interventions that\nare overly intrusive, and they may have concerns about security\nissues associated with remote transmission of personal data.\nThis particular issue may be resolved with emerging security\ntechnologies such as Integrated Circuit Metric [104], but these\nwill almost certainly need to be safeguarded with appropriate\nlegislation.\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 13http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nFigure 2.

It is possible that the high volume of data that certain\ntools may generate could discourage their adoption clinically,\nand it is to be determined whether data gathered remotely\nprovide a better picture of disease status than standard follow-up\nvisits and whether these technologies are associated with\nimprovements in long-term patient outcomes. Consensus about\nwhich technologies are most useful and cost-effective is lacking,\nand physicians may be reluctant to invest the time needed to\nbecome familiar with such tools, irrespective of any potential\nefficiency they offer.\nIn the future, digital and remote technologies may expand to\nother uses; for example, Web-based platforms such as\nPatientsLikeMe have been used to develop disease-specific\ninstruments (ie, the MSRS-R) [39], and the Internet-based Dutch\nMultiple Sclerosis Study used the Internet to recruit patients,\nmonitor symptoms, and capture long-term disease progression\ndata in real-world settings [105]. Similarly, interactive\ntechnologies such as the Web-based patient-management system\nMSDS3D may become increasingly common [106]. There are\nongoing initiatives to develop transparent systems for disease\nmonitoring and self-management in MS, such as Remote\nAssessment of Disease and Relapse in Central Nervous\nDisorders. This international research project is applying\nwearable devices and mobile phone technology to develop ways\nof measuring major depressive disorders, epilepsy, and MS\n[107]. There is also the MAPPING-MS initiative, a mobile\nhealth intervention that will deliver self-management strategies\nin patients with MS [108]. It seems likely that elements of the\nmany different apps, Web-based tools, and remote monitoring\nsystems that have already been adopted or are in development\nwill become part of larger integrated systems that facilitate\neHealth care conveniently for both patients and HCPs.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, many digital and remote communication\ntechnology applications have been developed for patients with\nMS, and evidence is accumulating for the benefits some of these\ncan bring compared with, and complementary to, traditional\nin-clinic approaches. Most tools focus on disease monitoring,\nself-management, treatment, and rehabilitation, so greater\nemphasis could be placed on developing tools dedicated to\nscreening and assessment. However, irrespective of the eHealth\nJMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2018 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e5 | p. 14http://rehab.jmir.org/2018/1/e5/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMarziniak et alJMIR REHABILITATION AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nsolution under consideration, data from large, controlled,\nmulticenter trials are lacking (only MSInvigor8 and Deprexis\nwere phase 2 trials), so it is difficult to draw objective\nconclusions about clinical benefits associated with each\ntechnology. Evaluation of eHealth solutions in phase 3 trials\nmay be precluded by cost, in which case prospective surveys\nin real-world settings [39] or large, retrospective database\nanalyses [46] may be the most pragmatic means of evaluation.\nUltimately, the long-term benefits afforded to patients and\nclinicians by any of these technologies will need to be\nestablished before their widespread adoption is likely.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge Oxford PharmaGenesis for providing editorial and medical writing support, which was funded by\nNovartis Pharma AG.\nConflicts of Interest\nMM has received lecture fees, travel grants, and fees for consulting from Bayer HealthCare AG, Beiersdorf AG, Biogen Idec\nGmbH, Merck KGaA, Novartis Pharma GmbH, Pfizer Pharma GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis (Genzyme), and Teva.
