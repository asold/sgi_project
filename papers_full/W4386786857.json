Introduction\nIn the gentle murmur of the server's hum,\nA dream awakened, something new begun.\nAn AI was birthed, with vision so bright,\nOpenAI, a beacon in the academic night [1].\nAnd so began a poem written by ChatGPT4 as requested by this author with the\nprompt, “Write a short poem about OpenAI, focusing on the recent DALL-E product\nlaunch in the style of Robert Frost.” The full poem (see Appendix A) goes on to plead,\n1\nNot the sunset of the human mind,\nBut a new dawn, a different kind.\nNot the end of art’s great reign,\nBut the start of a wonderful, shared domain [1].\nAs an English Literature major in college, this author felt chills as the poem\nunfolded above the“Send a message” text box of her ChatGPT4 account subscription.\nThe large language model (LLM) was indeed very good at mimicking human language\nand a full buy-in of anthropomorphism, the tendency to attribute humanlike charac-\nteristics to artificial intelligence (AI), occurred. It felt like the LLM knew a discussion\nof singularity would ensue in this book chapter. Singularity, posited by Kurzweil in his\nseminal book,The Singularity is Near[2], marks a time when artificial intelligence\ninnovation outpaces the human brain’s capabilities. Large Language Models (LLM)\nsuch as OpenAi’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing, Google’s Bard, and Baidu’s Ernie place\nhumanity at a pivotal time where mathematical neural networks could surpass, bene-\nfit, or deter all facets of human existence. The GPT-4 Technical Report compiled by\nthe members of the OpenAI team, claims that they trained the GPT-4 large multi-\nmodal (text and images) model on tests originally designed for humans, such as the\nbar exam, where the model outscored the vast majority of test takers [3].\nThe LLM falls short, however, in many real-world scenarios where humans excel.\nPhilosopher Herbert L. Dreyfus asserts that a subset of human knowledge is tacit,\nimplied, or understood without being stated, and cannot be contained or processed by a\ncomputer [4]. For instance, any organization’s sales force relies on both data and tacit\nknowledge shared about sales strategies to finesse a deal which cannot be found in any\ndatabase [5]. Faculty members teaching bioscience to nursing students convey the con-\ntent as well as connections to tacit knowledge with a diverse group of nursing students to\ndraw upon personal experiences to recognize and understand symptoms and make\nconnections to their patients’care [6]. In education, teachers’success in the classroom is\noften underpinned by their tacit knowledge gained from experience with children rather\nthan the explicit knowledge of the facts contained in their lesson plans [7].\nDuring an April 16th, 2023, 60 Minutes interview, Scott Pelley asked CEO Sundar\nPichai about the speed and capabilities of Google’s LLM Bard. Pichai shared that\npresently, Bard processes information 100,000 times faster than the human brain and\ndoes so through computer microchips and algorithms designed to allow the LLM to\nlearn [8]. Bard’s developers constantly update the LLM’s algorithms such that the\nsoftware created a self-taught model consisting of language patterns using the knowl-\nedge base of most of the content on the internet [8]. The sum of all information on the\ninternet contains both valid and biased data that the LLM learns, recognizes patterns,\nand propagates, perhaps to the detriment of marginalized groups. An example of AI’s\nbias is the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions\n(COMPAS) which is an AI algorithm that predicted recidivism. A study revealed that\nCOMPAS was biased against African Americans who were classified by the algorithm\nas twice as likely to recidivate as white individuals with the exact same profile [9].\nAI’s capability to teach itself can result in emergent properties that result in a\nsudden appearance of a novel behavior [10]. James Manyika who leads Googles efforts\nto examine how humanity and AI will coexist, shared an example of an emergent\nbehaviors where his team discovered that Bard learned how to translate English to\nBengali with very few prompts in the Bengali language [Pelley]. It is within this\nemergent behavior that LLMs increase to state-of-the art capabilities from near-zero\nperformance at unpredictable scales [11].\n2\nReimagining Education– The Role of E-Learning, Creativity, and Technology in the Post-Pandemic Era\nThe Future of Life Institute called for signatures on an open letter for a pause in the\ndevelopment of AI systems to address the potential dangers of advanced artificial\nintelligence systems that remain unchecked [Future of Life-Policy]. The present AI\nsystems are capable of hallucinations, a term attributed to an occurrence when a\nprompt results in the LLM providing information that does not align with facts, is\nirrelevant, or nonsensical, stemming from the limits of the training database and\nnascent algorithms [12]. AI systems already sustain social biases embedded in the\ntraining database that reflect the society that created the data. Among the reasons [13]\nfor a call to pause the feverish development of LLMs are:\n Manipulation of financial systems at the hands of moneyed institutions with the\nAI-buying power to sway trends in the stock market.\n Political groups that spread misinformation and realistic-looking images and\nvideos to sway voters.\n Accelerating the destabilization of labor markets to eliminate jobs.\n Threats to national security in the development of cyber, chemical, or biological\nweapons deployed by AI ground and air drones.\n The lack of ethical guardrails to ensure the safety and well-being of humanity.\n AI hardware systems substantially contribute to emissions and the carbon\nfootprint of the information and computer technology sector.\nAmong the signatories of an open letter [13] to pause giant AI experiments are\nSteve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, Elon Musk, an OpenAi co-founder and\nstartup investor, and Rachel Bronson, president of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scien-\ntists that maintains the Doomsday Clock. The Science and Security Board of the\nBulletin of the Atomic Scientists depicts threats to humanity and the planet to mark\nthe apocalypse as midnight that is a recognized metaphor for earth’s vulnerability\ndue to manmade technologies [14]. The Doomsday Clock is, at the time of this\nwriting in June of 2023, set to 90 seconds to midnight that the Science and Security\nBoard declare as a time of unprecedented danger [15]. The aggregate of risks\ncompelling the Science and Security Board to choose 90 seconds to the apocalypse\nincludes disruptive technology, described in the 2023 Doomsday Clock Statement as a\nvaried threat environment of cyber-attacks and high-tech weapons [15]. The state-\nment includes the additional categories of biological threats, climate change, and\nnuclear risk, all listed as areas of concern contributing to setting the clock to 90 sec-\nonds to midnight [15]. Nordgren [16] asserts that while AI as an information and\ncommunications technology (ICT) entity is a major contributor to greenhouse gas\nemissions, it can also be harnessed, as inherent in all AI, to study and ameliorate the\nproblems it creates.\nScholars at Tufts University Human-Robot Interaction Library [17] posit that the\n“big red button” to stop, interrupt or divert an AI system is too late without a\nsubstantive, ongoing evaluation to assess risk and prevent an apocalypse. Arnold and\nScheutz assert that human intervention is absolutely necessary to establish an ethics\ncore/testing layer embedded in algorithms to provide guardrails for AI software\nbefore deployment to interact with humanity [17].\n3\nThe Singularity Is Emerging: Large Language Models and the Impact of Artificial…\nDOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.1002650\nAs the ICT experts in the field tap the brakes on the emergence of the large-scale\nAI, educators around the globe grapple with the residual effects of technology-based\nplatforms and tools mandated during the worldwide pandemic and stay-at-home\ndirectives. Education has a history of technology-based mandates prior to the pan-\ndemic that were largely regarded by teachers as an invasive species akin to the rapid\ndispersal of the zebra mussel in the Great Lakes as a metaphor for the slow adoption of\ntechnology in schools [18]. In his keynote speech to Johns Hopkins University School\nof Education doctoral students in 2017, Dr. Larry Cuban noted that there exists a\nrhetoric of technology as a panacea to education where teachers are hardly involved in\nthe shaping of policy and planning [19]. The following sections seek to illuminate the\nreimagining of education around the globe in the post-pandemic era to harness the\npower of AI with our students.\n2. Navigating away from text-based assessments\nInspired by the sixth stanza of ChatGPT4’s poem (see Appendix), this author\nreflected on her colleagues’conversations about what educators experienced when\nthey retrofitted their existing lesson plans into the shared domain of hybrid teaching\nand learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. The emphasis of this reflection is on the\ndomino effect of lesson plans written for face-to-face teaching and the additional\nimpact of LLMs such as ChatGPT or Bard used by students to complete existing, text-\nbased assignments. While this topic might seem mundane to the reader in the after-\nmath of discussions about large-scale AI, the Singularity, and the Doomsday Clock,\nthe influence of LLMs in students’assessments is among the initial exposures to AI\nthat educators encounter and must address. It is suddenly the new invasive zebra\nmussel metaphor for technology posited by Zhao and colleagues [18]. A subset of\nstudents who have access to ChatGPT and Bard complete text-based writing\nassessments by inputting the assignment prompt into the LLM, producing an answer,\nand pasting the response into a Word document or discussion board to submit for\ngrading.\nColleagues’initial reaction is to attempt to detect the influence of LLMs in their\nstudents’work. Platforms such as TurnItIn updated their AI algorithm to flag LLM-\ngenerated passages [20]. A subsidiary of TurnItIn called iThenticate, which is\ndesigned for researchers, does not highlight LLM content [21]. There are many online\ntools such as AI Content Director [22], Content at Scale [23], and Crossplag [24]\navailable on the internet that claim to detect content generated by LLMs, however\ntheir website text boxes limit the content to small portions of a document and some-\ntimes charge a monthly fee. In the academic writing genre in higher education, long\nparagraphs without citations or disjointed sections without a proper“flow” from one\nsection to another can signal the use of LLMs and usually result in a request for\ncitations to support assertions and major revisions.\nA colleague of this author who is a university professor in Guatemala contacted her\nto discuss,\nIn the university where I teach, there have been recent concerns about the use of\nAI among students— specifically, the use of ChatGPT to produce their work. I\nunderstand and share the concerns; however, I cannot help but wonder if there is\na way to understand if and how we can use AI tools ethically in education,\nconsidering academic integrity [personal communication, 05/16/23].\n4\nReimagining Education– The Role of E-Learning, Creativity, and Technology in the Post-Pandemic Era\nDistrict policy makers and principals may assume that the tools provided to faculty\nwill cover LLM-generated text and the first they hear about the doubts cast on\nstudents’authorship bubbles up from the teachers to the administration. This under-\npins Cuban’s assertions that it makes sense to involve teachers early in the shaping of\npolicy and implementation [19].\nAnother colleague of the author who is a community college Chemistry professor\nin California echoes Cuban’s call for administrators to pay attention to the variety of\nways that LLMs impact their teaching and grading. She observed,\nOne thing that I've noticed recently that I think is really important to note is that\ninstitutions have to be sensitive to the fact that this is going to impact faculty\ndifferently and they need to support faculty, specifically in the way that they\nneed. Whether you're trying to resist it or embracing it, it feels manageable if\nyou're in science but not as a computer science faculty. But on the other side of\nthe fence, we have all our English and Humanities,“writing heavy” faculty and a\nlot of them are really struggling because what they're seeing is just endless essays\nthat are clearly being written by AI [personal communication, 05/30/23].\nDuring a work session with this author to experiment with prompting ChatGPT to\nrewrite the ending ofThe Scarlet Letter[25], a high school Social Studies and English\nLiterature colleague in the Northeast United States evaluated the LLM-generated\nalternative ending as follows:\nThe chapter AI wrote forThe Scarlet Letteris not at all \"good,\" as far as literary\nwriting goes, and is more or less another (inferior) way of stating what had\nalready happenedinternally to the characters. Good! That means great writers,\nat least for now, are safe from being overshadowed by AI! [personal\ncommunication, 06/27/23].\nThe colleague’s observation about the alternative ending emphasizes the\ntacit knowledge owned by humans that is recognizable as“internal” to the\ncharacter and not just a list of characters, setting, and plot. After a discussion about\nemploying ChatGPT or Bard as a tool to revamp lesson plans, the high school col-\nleague shared,\nI'm not sure how I feel about embracing the large language models as a collabo-\nrator for lesson planning and student engagement. I would say, at this point, I\ndon't feel quite comfortable [personal communication, 06/27/23].\nAs this author’s colleagues grapple with existing lesson plans and text-based\nassessments, the university professor in Guatemala shared that a current assignment\nrequires students to select a topic of interest, learn how to evaluate sources in a Google\nsearch, and write a draft of an essay to reflect on their findings for an initial grade of\n15 points. What she found is that students were willing to lose 15 points, input the\nessay prompt into ChatGPT, and abdicate their personal viewpoints to rely on the\nLLM to write their reflection and garner the 85 points for the final assignment. After\nour conversation about strategies to embrace LLMs, she modified her syllabus and\nassignment to require students to create a prompt about a topic of interest, input and\nrefine the inquiry intoboth ChatGPT and Bard, critically analyze the output of each\nLLM, identify biases, and prepare a video or audio recorded presentation, guided by a\n5\nThe Singularity Is Emerging: Large Language Models and the Impact of Artificial…\nDOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.1002650\nrubric listing required components, on a choice of platforms to exhibit their\nunderstanding and knowledge about the topic [personal communication, 06/13/23].\nHaving established the problem of a new flavor of students’LLM plagiarism for\nteachers to overcome, the next sections of this chapter address how platforms powered\nby AI can assist educators in the reimagining of education to redefine their syllabi, lesson\nplans, and assessments in a shared teaching and learning domain with their students.\n2.1 An unbalanced teacher workload\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is a group\nof 38 member countries established in 1961 to support world trade and economic\nprogress [26]. The OECD publishes theEducation at a Glanceannual report to docu-\nment comparisons of education outcomes and opportunities on an international scale\n[27]. It is compelling to note that among the findings of the 2022 report is the following\nstatement about teachers’tasks across the globe in primary and secondary levels:\nTeachers spend an important share of their working hours on tasks other than\nteaching, such as preparing lessons and assessing examinations. In some coun-\ntries, upper secondary teachers are expected to teach for less than one-third of\ntheir total working time, whereas in other countries, they are expected to teach\nfor almost two-thirds of their working time [27].\nTo state the unbalanced workload of educators in a different way, teachers spend\nmore than one to two-thirds of their valuable time preparing lessons, assessments, and\ngrading than actually teaching curriculum to their students.\nOn the tertiary level, the OECD notes that academic staff vary by country in their\ninstructional and research responsibilities. In most countries, the responsibilities of\nfaculty are divided between research and teaching. The instructional workload for\ntertiary faculty centered on the switch and retention of online teaching and learning\nthat required faculty to produce learning materials and digital exams workable in\nhybrid modalities [28].\nThe following sections analyze how AI can help teachers to streamline their work-\nload and how educators can introduce students to the benefits and drawbacks of AI in\ntheir studies and preparation for the emergence of the singularity.\n2.2 AI tools for educators\nThe Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR) frame-\nwork developed by Puentedura [29] helps educators evaluate software employed as\ntools to prepare and deliver course materials to students. For instance, traditional quiz\nsoftware such as Quizalize is asubstitute for paper-based quizzes [30]. Teachers who\ntype their multiple-choice questions and answers into the platform or select a shared\nquiz on a topic that aligns with their curriculum can automate the assessment. The\naugmentation aspect of online quiz platforms aligns with the features of the software\nthat support mastery learning by tracking individual student’s understanding of a\ntopic aligned with objectives and standards. A quiz platformmodifies an assessment by\nturning the teacher’s quiz into game-based learning in single, group, and class compe-\ntitions with engaging graphics and leaderboards. It is in theredefinition of quiz soft-\nware that aligns with AI and LLMs. Platforms such as Quizalize who upgraded their\nsoftware to connect an application programming interface (API) with ChatGPT.\n6\nReimagining Education– The Role of E-Learning, Creativity, and Technology in the Post-Pandemic Era\nTeachers can now input a prompt into the textbox provided by Quizalize to ask the\nLLM to provide quiz questions and answers.\nEngineering the prompt to communicate directly with ChatGPT or through an API\nis where the redefinition continues. Learners who interact with technology platforms\ncan become perplexed about why a program or platform is not working as they\nexpected. As a programming teacher, this author shares the following maxim with all\nlearners in her middle school through doctoral classes who complete coding assign-\nments on a wide variety of programming languages and platforms:\n“The program is doing exactly what you told it to do!”\nThe same maxim applies to LLM prompt engineering.Table 1offers an example of\nthree iterations of a prompt to create a multiple-choice quiz about LLM terminology.\nPrompt Selected sample output\nFirst try that the author typed directly into\nChapGPT4:\n(ChatGPT4 text box)\nSend a message:Create a multiple-choice quiz with\nfour plausible options for each term,\nanthropomorphism, bias, hallucination, and\ntemperature. The author did not ask for the LLM to\nindicate the correct answer nor did the prompt\nrequest the definition of the terms in the context of\nLLMs.\n1. What does the term“anthropomorphism” refer to?\na. The practice of attributing human\ncharacteristics to non-human entities.\nb. The cultural belief that nature is governed\nby spirits.\nc. The scientific study of human evolution\nand development.\nd. The process of converting human\nexperiences into written form.\nSee Appendix B for the first try full output.\nSecond try that the author typed directly into\nChatGPT4:\n(ChatGPT4 text box)\nSend a message:Create a multiple-choice quiz that\ndefines the term and then use the word bank of\nterms anthropomorphism, bias, hallucination, and\ntemperature as possible answers. Please create the\nquiz in relation to large language models. Indicate\nthe correct answer for each question.\nQuestion 1:This term refers to the attribution of\nhuman traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human\nentities, such as artificial intelligence or animals. A.\nBias B. Anthropomorphism C. Hallucination D.\nTemperature Correct Answer: B. Anthropomorphism\nSee Appendix C for the second try full output.\nThird try that the author typed into the Quizalize\nChatGPT API text box:\n(Quizalize text box)\nAsk ChatGPT for questions about:Create a\nmultiple-choice quiz that defines the term and then\nuse the word bank of terms anthropomorphism,\nbias, hallucination, and temperature as possible\nanswers. Please create the quiz in relation to large\nlanguage models. Indicate the correct answer for\neach question.\nQuizalize provided an additional question regarding\nlarge language models:\nQ. What does the term“large language model” refer\nto?\nThe study of comparative language structures\nacross different languages\nA type of artificial intelligence that uses\ncomplex neural networks to analyze and generate\nhuman language\nA type of software for automatic translation of\nspoken languages\nA system for analyzing the structure and\nmeaning of written text\nSee Appendix D and Appendix E for the third try\nfull output.\nTable 1.\nPrompt engineering to create a quiz on four LLM terms [31].\n7\nThe Singularity Is Emerging: Large Language Models and the Impact of Artificial…\nDOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.1002650\nThis author used her ChatGPT4 subscription to generate a quiz about four terms.\nPlease observe that the first trydid not include a specific instruction to create the quiz\nusing the terms as associated with LLMs. The LLM generated quiz questions including\nmultiple-choice answers among alternative definitions of the term.\nDuring the second try, the prompt included a request for a quiz related to the\nterminology associated with LLMs. The third try input the refined prompt tested in\nChatGPT directly into the author’s free Quizalize account. The API also provided a fifth\nquiz question about large language models. The dashboard, depicted with the platform’s\npermission in Appendix F, provide a view of the quiz, the options to assign for home-\nwork, an assessment, or to gamify using individual, group, or class competitions.\nUsing the ChatGPT and Quizalize platforms, educators can refine prompts to\ncreate a quiz from a bank of terms, edit the quiz to align with the content taught in\ntheir sections of a course, and share the assessment with colleagues. Circling back to\nthe OECD finding that teachers spend an“important share” [27] of their workload\ncreating lessons, assessments, and grading, it is crucial for district leaders, coaches,\nand professional developers to provide the guidance about AI tools such as Quizalize\nto produce andshare resources to increase the amount of time that teachers can spend\nteaching the curriculum.\nHaving established the opportunity for educators to harness AI to revamp writing-\nheavy assignments and adopt tools such as Quizalize to reduce teachers’planning and\ngrading workload, this chapter now turns to our students who must learn how AI\nworks to prepare them for dramatically different opportunities in the workforce.\n2.3 Students as producers rather than consumers of AI\nOur students are very familiar with AI in their daily lives besides LLMs that\nprovide shortcuts to assignments. Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term that refers\nto an ever-expanding group of computer techniques. Examples of how our students\nalready interact with AI include [32]:\n Speech recognition–Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa on phones or tablets.\n Recommendation systems–Netflix provides next viewing suggestions based on\nwhat you already watched.\n Anomaly detection–Banks will alert credit card holders of charges out of the\nordinary with the customer’s location and purchasing history.\n Object detection–Google Lens will search for what you see, via the camera on\nyour device or in stored pictures, including where to purchase a similar outfit in\nthe image.\nTo begin to understand how an AI recommendation system works, students and\nteachers can create a sample database in an“unplugged” activity on paper to produce\na recommendation. The following example lists the six records of data to answer the\nquestion, “What new streaming series would you recommend next for a new sub-\nscriber who just watched the Mandalorian?” (Table 2).\nThe Netflix algorithm is an example of supervised learning with structured data where\nthe system learns to recommend series based on labels such as comedy, action-adventure,\nspace western to train itself using patterns to offer the next suggested series [32].\n8\nReimagining Education– The Role of E-Learning, Creativity, and Technology in the Post-Pandemic Era\nGoogle Lens [33] application is an example of unstructured data where AI is\ntrained on images associated with labels. For instance, one can take or select a photo\non their mobile or tablet devices to identify an object, shop for a similar item, translate\ntext in 100 languages, solve math, history, biology, chemistry, and physics problems.\nIt becomes evident as we review the scope of AI tools available to students that lesson\nplans and assessments must expand to applying and synthesizing math, social studies,\nscience, world language knowledge rather than isolated answers which regurgitate\nfacts, recites science facts, or parrots the conjugation of verbs. In a needs assessment\nconducted by this author, students long to apply their knowledge rather than“solve\nfor X” [34].\nThe good news is that students can acquire hands-on experience to produce AI\nprojects in the Python programming language through organizations such as AIClub\n[32]. Dr. Nisha Talagala is the co-founder and CEO of AIClub and AIClubPro. This\nauthor found Dr. Talagala’s work during her research about teaching and learning AI,\nPython, and the examination of datasets by students to implement real world,\nauthentic AI applications. During her AIClub Student Research Symposium 2023, Dr.\nTalagala emphasized that research is,“an organized way to think about a problem”\n[35]. Her students in grades 7–12 brainstorm a topic of interest, search for data among\nthe plentiful public datasets available on the internet, create a hypothesis, learn how to\ncode a Python program that interfaces with AI algorithms to evaluate the data with a\nprototype of their application, and record results. The students can then present their\nresearch at the yearly AIClub symposium, submit their work to international compe-\ntitions [36], publish their work in conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journals.\nIn the case of the seventh-grade female student listed inTable 3, one can present the\nproject at their school science fair [35]. Students analyze public datasets available on\nthe internet such as Kaggle [36] and medical, satellite, and drone images. Then the\nstudents use this information to analyze the data and propose solutions through open-\nsource AI tools and platforms to produce web or mobile applications.\nThis author attended the 2023 AIClub Symposium [35] to witness students’pre-\nsentations about their projects listed inTable 3. Most students noted that this was\ntheir first experience developing an AI project.\n2.3.1 Real-world authentic connections to students’AI projects\nWe are in the midst of the fourth“industrial revolution.” As educators, it is\nessential for us to keep pace with the emergence of AI as we prepare our students for\nthe workforce in the Fourth Industrial Revolution of a worldwide economy.

The international imperative to reimagine education\nThe general curriculum inmost developed countriesis still modeled after the 1894\npublished directives of the Harvard Committee of Ten [58, 59]. Appointed by the\nNational Educational Association in 1891, and led by Charles W. Eliot, the President at\nHarvard University at that time, this committee gathered in subject-area“confer-\nences” with the goal of establishing the uniformity of school programs. The global\nechoes of the Committee of Ten’s decisions are still evident in the structure of Ele-\nmentary and Grammar School, grades one through eight aligned with ages six to 14,\nand Secondary School, grades nine through 12 aligned with ages 14 through 18.\nSubject disciplines established by the Committee of Ten were siloed into Latin, Greek,\nEnglish, Modern Language, Mathematics, Science, Natural History (Earth Science),\nHistory, and Geography [60].\nIn his address to the Royal Society for the Arts in 2010, Sir Ken Robinson pondered\nthe question,“How do we educate our children to take their place in the economies of\nthe 21\nst Century?” Robinson then led the viewers through an explanation grounded in\nthe idea that school systems around the globe are trying to“… meet the future by what\nthey did in the past” [61]. Robinson laments that the current structure of education\nmirrors the economics of the First Industrial Revolution fostering mass production\ncapabilities of the conveyor belt to sequentially deliver students to the next grade\norganized by age.\nThe residual categorizations of the Committee of Ten established in 1894 aligned\nwith age disregard the academic abilities of students who could study with more\ncapable peers that align with Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). ZPD\ntakes a child’s cognitive age representative of what the student already mastered and\nwhat the student can produce through association with those around them. Vygotsky\nemphasized the social aspects of learning that extend beyond test results to challenge\nevery child to grasp new concepts through collaborative learning among peers and\ntheir teachers [62].\nEducators conducting research in Ontario, Canada noted that grade acceleration\nand the opportunity to learn alongside more capable peers aligns with neurodivergent\n“gifted” students, however the inclusive school study setting still aligned with grade-\nlevel steps and skips [63]. Dare and colleagues [63] define inclusive education in two\ncategories, academic and social.\n Academic inclusion–all students access core curriculum. Students who already\nmastered content can gain access to advanced curricula that aligns with their\ncognitive age.\n Social inclusion–the school community accepts all students to promote belonging,\nand involvement in school life that promotes positive relationships among peers.\nThe inclusive schools studied by Dare and colleagues conveys the importance of\npositive school environment marked social inclusion and is echoed by the Finnish\neducation system which enables sustainable well-being, is progressive, value-based,\nand student-centered. The national curriculum of Finland has been celebrated as a\n13\nThe Singularity Is Emerging: Large Language Models and the Impact of Artificial…\nDOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.1002650\ntwenty first century global success story. The basic curriculum of Finland is\nnational; however, municipalities do their own alignments, and schools decide on\nthe details [64].\nThe key challenges faced by Finland in retooling their curriculum address the\nfollowing needs from the school’s perspectives [64].\n1.Developing school cultures to support curriculum values and goals to foster\nschools as real learning communities.\n2.The student’s role is more active and inclusive.\n3.The teacher’s role changes to reduce lecture-based content delivery.\n4.Technology and digitalization of contentincluding codingand digital learning\nplatforms strongly implemented into the schools’ecosystem.\n5.Project-based and multidisciplinary learning modules aligned with transversal\ncompetencies at least once a year in all schools and all grades.\na. The Seven Transversal Competencies of Finland’s National Curriculum\nare:\ni. Thinking and learning to learn\nii. Taking care of oneself and others, managing daily activities, and\nsafety\niii. Cultural competence, interaction, and expression\niv. Multi-literacy\nv. ICT competence\nvi. Competence for the world of work and entrepreneurship\nvii. Participation and influence to build a sustainable future.\n6.A shift toward assessment as learning to foster self-assessment and peer-\nassessment supported by formative feedback.\nFinland’s national curriculum does mention grade-level assessments, but it is\ninteresting to note that verbal assessments can be used in grades one through seven\nand numerical assessments, reflecting school decisions on the local level, tobegin\nnumerical assessments no later than eighth grade.\nThis author asserts that the most compelling transversal competency of Finland’s\nNational Curriculum that aligns best with preparing our teachers and students to\nembrace the emergence of AI worldwide is number five,\n“Project-based and multidisciplinary learning modules aligned with transversal\ncompetencies at least once a year in all schools and all grades [64].”\n14\nReimagining Education– The Role of E-Learning, Creativity, and Technology in the Post-Pandemic Era\nThis chapter concludes by examining the transversal competencies as they align\nwith the continue emergence of AI and the imperative for schools on a global scale to\nkeep pace with, and harness AI.\n4. Conclusion\nThis book chapter began with an imperative for education stakeholders to\nrealize that we live in a pivotal time in our human existence where AI\nmathematical neural networks are on the precipice of outpacing human capabilities. We\ndo not have the luxury of meeting the future by staying in a well-worn groove of we did\nin the past. Let us imagine that project-based, multidisciplinary learning modules\naligned with transversal competencies in all schools and grades asthe centerof our school\nyear rather than what we do when the standardized“teaching to the test” is over.\nThe first transversal competency, thinking and learning to Learn, andsecond trans-\nversal competency,“taking care of oneself and others, managing daily activities, and\nsafety, lean into metacognition and self-regulation [64]”. Bruning, Schraw, and Norby\nassert that acquiring knowledge in only one part of cognitive growth. It is crucial that\nstudents develop metacognitive strategies to know about their own thinking, and to\nreflect on what they learned [65]. Authentic, project-based,multidisciplinary learning\nwith the opportunity to have time to collaborate with classmates and teachers is\ncrucial to learning [62].\nThe third transversal competency reflects cultural competence, interaction, and\nexpression [64]. Ng, Van Dyne,and Ang define cultural intelligence (CQ) as an individ-\nual’s capabilities to manage and function effectively in culturally diverse settings [66].\nThe emergence of AI is a global concern, and our students must develop their CQ to\nheighten awareness and empathy for their international peers. Together, they can harness\nthe emerging neural networks for the benefit of all cultures and geographic locations.\nWink asserts that all literate processes are socially constructed and are derived\nfrom social practices [67]. An awareness of the categories of multiliteracy [66] must\nbe embraced by educators to foster students’skills to achieve the fourth transversal\ncompetency through mastery of the following literacies:\n Academic literacy–the language of schools and universities.\n Functional literacy–languages of life including colloquial conversation.\n Workplace literacy–languages of our jobs\n Information literacy–languages of technology\n Constructive literacy–language we construct with the printed word.\n Emergent literacy–language constructed with text.\n Cultural literacy–language that help us think deeply about complex topics.\n Financial literacy–language to help students manage money responsibly.\n Reflective literacy–reading, writing, and reflecting–a multifaceted approach.\n15\nThe Singularity Is Emerging: Large Language Models and the Impact of Artificial…\nDOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.1002650\nThe Covid-19 pandemic brought the significant disparities within countries and\neconomies to a heightened reality as global citizens struggled to connect with work,\nschool, and life during the global lockdown [67]. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic,\nscholars such as Hooft-Graafland noted that the countries of Costa Rica, Estonia,\nFinland, France, Greece, and Spain formally recognized Internet access as a human\nright [68]. Thefifth transversal competency, ICT competence, is diminished in the age\nof AI emergence without access to online resources and skills mastered by the AIClub\nstudents’research delineated inTable 3.\nThe sixth transversal competency for the world of work and entrepreneurship\nunderscores the need for education stakeholders to become authentic leaders\nguiding our students who will be well-positioned to engage in the workplace domi-\nnated by AI. Scholars Jenson and Luthans categorize authentic leaders as confident,\noptimistic, hopeful, transparent, moral/ethical, resilient, and future oriented [69].\nThrough Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development [62], our students in the midst\nof authentic leaders can become future-oriented entrepreneurs and authentic leaders\nas well [70].\nThe seventh transversal competency, the participation and influence to build a\nsustainable future, is the most compelling in our discussion of emerging AI and casts a\nwarning and imperative to reimagine education in the post-pandemic era. Scholars\nCharles Fadel and Jennifer Groff, writing in 2019, explain the acronym for our VUCA\nworld as volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity [71]. The intersections of\nthe VUCA acronym aptly describe the emergence of a neural network singularity\nwhere we can no longer stagnate in the well-worn groove of the siloed curriculum\nestablished in 1893 by the Committee of Ten [60, 71].\nLet us reimagine education in international settings to prepare our\nstudents to be producers of multidisciplinary projects to harness AI for the benefit of\nhumanity.\nAcknowledgements\nThis author expresses her gratitude to:\nDr. Nisha Talagala for inviting me to the 2023 AIClub Student Research Sympo-\nsium to meet her outstanding student-researchers to learn about their impactful AI\nprojects.\nConflict of interest\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.\nNotes/thanks/other declarations\nThis author expresses her thanks to:\nCharles Wiles, Co-CEO at Quizalize for allowing me to depict the Zzish Quizalize\nplatform in this book chapter and Luis Pardo, Marketing Manager of Quizalize for\n16\nReimagining Education– The Role of E-Learning, Creativity, and Technology in the Post-Pandemic Era\ncoordinating our discussions about ChatGPT and quiz development in education and\nlesson planning.\nAppendix A\nDALL-E\nIn the gentle murmur of the server’s hum,\nA dream awakened, something new begun.\nAn AI was birthed, with vision so bright,\nOpenAI, a beacon in the academic night.\nThrough silicon neurons, ideas were born,\nTales of tomorrow, and of the past forlorn.\nThen came DALL-E, bold and wise,\nWith a painter’s eye and a seer’s guise.\nAn image from a phrase, a dream from a word,\nA world where the unheard could be heard.\nCrafting images from the ether’s mist,\nRendering the unseen, with an artist’s wrist.\n“An armchair in the shape of an avocado,” you say?\nDone!
