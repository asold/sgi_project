An incoming seizure\nmay be inhibited by some interventions such as medication and electrical or magne tic\nstimulation of the brain, if it is predicted in advance ( Elger, 2001 ). Therefore, accurate\nprediction of epileptic seizure could not only signiﬁcantly improve the quality of life\nfor patients, but also provide a basis for the development of more eﬀective met hods of\nprevention and treatment of epilepsy. There are four phases of brain activity for patients:\ninterictal phase (between seizures), preictal phase (prior to seizure), ic tal phase (seizure),\nand postictal phase (after seizure). If the preictal state could be identiﬁed from other\nFrontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org\nWu et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnins./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum\nstates, an imminent seizure will be predicted. The primary\nchallenge in seizure prediction is the classiﬁcation of preictal\nand interictal states (baseline). Electroencephalogram (EEG) is\na method commonly used to diagnose epilepsy and evaluate\nits therapeutic eﬀect (\nFisher et al., 2005 ). In the recent years,\nan increasing number of literature demonstrates that there is a\npattern in preictal EEG (\nUsman et al., 2019 ), and prediction of\nepileptic seizure by EEG is feasible.\nRecently, the methods of seizure prediction have focused\non time-frequency analysis, non-linear dynamics, and deep\nlearning network. Common time-frequency analysis methods\nsuch as wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition\n(EMD) have been applied to obtain EEG modes on diﬀerent\nscales for seizure detection and prediction (\nZahra et al., 2017 ;\nZhang et al., 2018 ; Hassan et al., 2020 ; Savadkoohi et al.,\n2020). However, wavelet transform is not adaptive and the\nproblems of EMD on low robustness and limited mathematical\ninterpretation need to be improved (\nDragomiretskiy and Zosso,\n2013). Recently proposed variational mode decomposition\n(VMD) could separate the non-stationary signal into intrinsic\nmodes with narrow band as well as EMD, but the advantages\nin complete mathematical theory framework and greater\nrobustness (\nDragomiretskiy and Zosso, 2013 ; Lahmiri, 2015 )\nmake it applied increasingly in various ﬁelds ( Upadhyay and\nPachori, 2015 ; Xue et al., 2016 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ; Li et al.,\n2018; Taran and Bajaj, 2018 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Dora and Biswal,\n2020; Guo et al., 2020 ), including epileptic seizure classiﬁcation\n(Rout and Biswal, 2020 ; Peng et al., 2021 ). In addition to\nsome statistical features in time domain and power spectral\nestimation in frequency domain, some non-linear dynamical\nparameters such as fractal dimension (\nAarabi and He, 2017 ),\nlargest Lyapunov exponent ( Fei et al., 2017 ), fuzzy distribution\nentropy ( Zhang et al., 2018 ), and Hjorth parameters ( Teixeira\net al., 2014 ) were also selected as features. Because it was diﬃcult\nto describe preictal state with just a few features, many tedious\nfeature engineering techniques were involved in the previous\nstudies. However, some features were a lack of reproducibility\nand reliability (\nMormann et al., 2005 , 2007; Assi et al., 2017b ).\nRecently, deep learning networks, including convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks, have attracted most interest in seizure prediction, as\ntheir classiﬁcation performance of preictal state and interictal\nstate is superior to traditional machine learning techniques\n(\nTsiouris et al., 2018 ; Usman et al., 2019 ). The latest bidirectional\nencoder representations from transformer (BERT) ( Lee and\nToutanova, 2018 ) is a very attractive deep learning network,\nwhich has made a great progress in the ﬁeld of natural language\nprocessing (NLP). It has demonstrated superior performance\nover LSTM on many NLP tasks. Its application potential in other\ntime series analysis is worth further exploring.\nIn this paper, a multidimensional extension of SVMD\nis proposed to adaptively extract common intrinsic modes\namong all channels on diﬀerent time scales. After decomposed\nby multivariate SVMD, task-independent modes of the\ndata could be removed for preprocessing or denoising.\nThen, the power spectrum of denoised iEEG data is input\nto a pre-trained BERT model for seizure prediction. The\nproposed seizure prediction method works well on two\niEEG datasets.\nThe work is organized as follows. In Materials and\nmethods, we introduce the information of database used\nin this paper and the proposed scheme, respectively. In\naddition, method of performance evaluation and seizure\nprediction are shown in this section. In Results, we present the\nexperiments’ results. In Discussion, we discuss the preprocessing\nmethod of SVMD and diﬀerent seizure prediction methods\nused on the iEEG dataset. Finally, we conclude this paper\nin Conclusion.\nMaterials and methods\nEEG dataset\nThe ﬁrst dataset was obtained from Kaggle American\nEpilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge ( https://www.\nkaggle.com/competitions/seizure-prediction/). It is comprised\nof long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from ﬁve\ndogs and two patients. Another dataset used in this study is\ncomprised of continuous iEEG recordings from three dogs\n(Dog_6, Dog_7, and Dog_8), which could be obtained from\nNIH-sponsored International Epilepsy Electrophysiology portal\n(\nhttps://www.ieeg.org). The Canine iEEG data were sampled\nfrom 16 or 15 electrodes at 400 Hz. iEEG data of two patients\nwere sampled at 5,000 Hz and recorded with 15 (Patient_1)\nand 24 (Patient_2) implanted electrodes, respectively. The type\nof seizures is focal epilepsy. More details were described in\nreference (\nBrinkmann et al., 2016 ). In this dataset, 1 h before\nseizure with a 5-min horizon (i.e., 66–5 min before seizure\nonset) was chosen as preictal phase (\nBrinkmann et al., 2016 ;\nAssi et al., 2017a ; Gagliano et al., 2019 ; Nejedly et al., 2019 ;\nYu et al., 2021 ). Each consecutive interictal sequence lasted\nfor 1 h, which were randomly chosen from iEEG recordings\nmore than 1 week (dogs) and 4 h (patients) before or after any\nseizure. The iEEG portal dataset is comprised of continuous\niEEG recordings, which are all labeled. The Kaggle dataset\nconsists of training data and testing data. Each labeled iEEG\nsequence of training data lasts for 1 h, and unlabeled testing data\nare 10-min iEEG segment (the contest website does not have\nlabels for test data, and the score could only be obtained by\nuploading the predicted results of all test data to the website).\nThe description of the data used in this work is shown in\nTable 1.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org\nWu et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnins./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum\nTABLE /one.tnum Description of the Kaggle dataset.\nParticipant No. of No. of Interictal No. of\nchannels seizures hours testing segments\nDog_1 16 4 80 502\nDog_2 16 7 83 1,000\nDog_3 16 12 240 907\nDog_4 16 16 134 990\nDog_5 15 5 75 191\nDog_6 16 41 998 -\nDog_7 16 38 936 -\nDog_8 16 15 286 -\nPatient_1 15 2 8.3 195\nPatient_2 24 3 7 150\nPreprocessing methods\nThe multidimensional extension of successive variational\nmode decomposition (SVMD) is proposed for time-\nfrequency analysis of non-stationary multi-channel signals\nin this section. Multivariate SVMD is used to remove\nirrelevant modes for denoising in the presented seizure\nprediction method.\nSuccessive variational mode decomposition is established\nunder the similar theoretical framework as VMD, which\nrequires each extracted mode to be compact around its\ncenter frequency and original data to be reconstructed by\nall modes. However, diﬀerent from VMD, SVMD could\nsuccessively decompose each intrinsic mode from a signal\nwithout specifying the number of modes in advance. Therefore,\nthere is no complex multi-parameter optimization problem\nfor SVMD. Details of the algorithm could be found in the\nreference (\nNazari and Sakhaei, 2020 ). As there is also a\nlot of demand for analyzing multi-channel signals in real-\nworld applications, a simple multivariate extension of SVMD\nis presented.\nMultidimensional SVMD aimed to adaptively extract\ncommon intrinsic modes ui(t) with limited bandwidth\nfrom multivariate signal f (t) containing C channels, i.e.,\nf (t)=[f1(t), f2(t), . . ., fc(t)].\nf (t)=\n∑ L\ni=1 ui(t) (1)\nwhere ui(t) =[ui1(t), ui2(t), . . ., uic(t)], C is the number of\nchannels and L is the number of common modes decomposed\nby multivariate SVMD.\nIt is noteworthy that intrinsic modes on the lth scale ul(t) are\nset to the same central frequency ω l in our model for the purpose\nof getting common modes of C channels on the same time\nscale. According to the deﬁnition of intrinsic mode function,\nui(t) should be limited bandwidth signals, which is the central\nassumption for mode separation in SVMD. Therefore, the\naverage bandwidth of all modes on the lth time scale should be\nminimized. Equivalently, the total bandwidth of C modes forms\ncost function L1 in multivariate SVMD optimization problem\nand is given by\nL1 =\n∑ C\nk=1\n\n\n\n ∂ t\n[(\nδ (t) + j\nπ t\n)\n∗ulk(t)\n]\ne−jω lt\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n(2)\nTo obtain the complete modes on the lth scale and avoid\nmode mixing with other scales, neither the previously extracted\nl −1 modes nor undecomposed part fuk(t) of the kth channel\n(k = 1, 2, . . ., C) should contain any information of the\nlth mode. Meanwhile, there should be no spectral overlap\nbetween the lth mode and previously decomposed l −1 modes.\nAccordingly, criteria L2, namely, the total frequency response\nof residual signals (\n{\nuik(t)\n} l−1\ni=1 and fuk(t)) of all channels after\npassing through the ﬁlter ˆβ l(ω )(frequency response of the lth\nﬁlter), should be minimized. Furthermore, for the kth channel,\nthe total energy of ﬁltered ulk(t) by each ﬁlter ˆβ i(ω ) ( i =\n1, 2, . . .l−1) requires as less as possible. This constraint is shown\nin the cost function L3.\nL2 =\n∑ C\nk=1\n\n\n\n β l(t) ∗\n(\nfuk(t) +\n∑ l−1\ni=1 uik(t)\n) \n\n\n\n2\n2\n(3)\nL3 =\n∑ C\nk=1\n∑ l−1\ni=1\n\n β i(t) ∗ulk(t)\n\n 2\n2 (4)\nˆβ i(ω ) = 1\nα (ω −ω i)2 i =1, 2, . . ., L (5)\nThe constrained variational optimization problem for\nmultivariate SVMD is represented as follows:\nmin\nulk,ω l,fuk(t)\nα L1 +L2 +L3\ns.t. ulk(t) +fuk(t) +∑ l−1\ni=1 uik(t) =fk(t),\nk =1, 2, . . ., C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\nThe augmented Lagrange function shown in (7) is used\nto transform this problem into unconstrained optimization\nproblem, which could be solved iteratively by ADMM approach\n(\nBertsekas, 1982)\nL ( ulk, ω l, λ k) =α L1 +L2 +L3\n+∑ C\nk=1\n\n\n fk(t) −\n(\nulk(t) +fuk(t) +∑ l−1\ni=1 uik(t)\n) \n\n\n2\n2\n+∑ C\nk=1\n⣨\nλ k(t), fk(t) −\n(\nulk(t) +fuk(t) +∑ l−1\ni=1 uik(t)\n)⟩\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\nThe ﬁrst subproblem is focused on updating the modes ulk\niteratively by channel.

Consequently, a heuristic method\nsimilar to SVMD is introduced to obviate optimization of α . In\nthe iteration of extracting modes of the lth scale, α is set to grow\nexponentially from a small value α min to a maximum allowable\nvalue α max, which is actually a process of ﬁnding the strongest\nmodes in the residual signals from coarse to ﬁne tuning.\nThe algorithm terminates search until total energy of all the\nlth modes is less than the given threshold ε 2; namely, the modes\nextracted could be regarded as noise. Finally, all the obtained\nmodes are sorted by their center frequency from low to high.\nThe complete algorithm for multivariate SVMD is described in\nTable 2.\nClassiﬁcation and evaluation\nThe human iEEG data were down-sampled to 500 Hz to be\ncomparable to canine iEEG. To reduce computational burden\nof SVMD, both preictal and interictal iEEG data were ﬁrst\ndivided into 2-s clips without overlap. Then, all iEEG clips\nwere decomposed by multivariate SVMD. Irrelevant modes of\nraw iEEG data were removed and the remaining ones were\nadded up for reconstruction. Subsequently, the reconstructed\ndata were concatenated into a new time series in chronological\norder. The denoised iEEG data were split into 30-s-long samples\nwith 28-s overlap. To use modal information in time-frequency\ndomain for prediction, power spectrum was extracted by the\nshort-time Fourier transform (STFT). Each iEEG sample was\nsegmented by a 1-s time window with 75% overlap to compute\nthe power spectrum by the function spectrum in MATLAB. Only\nthe power spectrum from 0 to 140 Hz is selected in this study,\nand the average of the power per 2 Hz is calculated as the ﬁnal\nspectrum. The power spectrum of iEEG samples was input to a\ndeep learning network based on BERT for seizure prediction. To\ncompare the performance of preprocessing, the power spectrum\nof raw iEEG was also input to BERT for classiﬁcation.\nBERT model architecture\nThe classic BERT’s model architecture is based on a multi-\nlayer bidirectional transformer encoder (\nVaswani et al., 2017 )\nand it uses bidirectional self-attention mechanism. After being\npre-trained with two unsupervised tasks, all parameters of BERT\ncould be ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the downstream\ntasks. The code and pre-trained models are available at\nhttps://\ngithub.com/matlab-deep-learning/transformer-models . In this\nstudy, the classiﬁcation of preictal and interictal iEEG could be\nconsidered as a downstream task to ﬁnetune a pre-trained BERT\nmodel with an additional output layer. Our model architecture\nconsists of input layer, encoder layer (transformer blocks), fully\nconnected layer, and Softmax classiﬁcation layer, as shown in\nFigure 1.\nIt is worth noting that BERT is originally designed to solve\nNLP tasks, and the input representation is a token sequence\ntransformed from a sentence (\nWu et al., 2016 ). However,\nthe input data are essentially a digital time series, which is\nunnecessary to convert to tokens and then use word embedding\nin the input layer. Therefore, a more suitable embedding method\nFrontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org\nWu et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnins./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum\nTABLE /two.tnum The complete algorithm of multivariate SVMD.\nThe algorithm of SVMD\nInitialize: l←0, ε 1 ←10−6, ε 2 ←10−3\nrepeat\nl←l+1\nSet ˆu1\nLk(ω ), ˆλ 1\nk, ω 1\nL, n←0, m←0, α 1 ←α min\nrepeat\nm←m+1\nrepeat\nn←n+1\nfor k =1 : C do\nUpdate ulk for all ω ≥0:\nˆun +1\nlk (ω ) =\nˆfk(ω ) +α 2 ( ω −ω n\nl )\n4 ˆun\nlk (ω ) +\nˆλ k\n2[\n1 +α 2 ( ω −ω n\nl )\n4 ] [\n1 +2α ( ω −ω n\nl )\n2 +∑ l−1\ni=1\n1\nα 2 ( ω −ω i ) 4\n]\nend for\nfor k =1 : C do\nUpdate ω l\nω n+1\nl =\n∑ C\nk=1\n∫ ∞\n0 ω\n⏐\n⏐\n⏐ ˆun+1\nlk (ω )\n⏐\n⏐\n⏐\n2\ndω\n∑ C\nk=1\n∫ ∞\n0\n⏐\n⏐\n⏐ ˆun+1\nlk (ω )\n⏐\n⏐\n⏐\n2\ndω\nend for\nfor k =1 : C do\nDual Ascent for all ω ≥0:\nˆλ n+1\nk =ˆλ n\nk +τ [ˆfk(ω ) −(ˆun+1\nlk (ω )\n+\nα 2 ( ω −ω n\nl )\n4\n(\nˆfk (ω )−ˆun+1\nlk (ω )−∑ l−1\ni=1 ˆuik(ω )+\nˆλ k\n2\n)\n−∑ l−1\ni=1 ˆuik(ω )\n1+α 2\n(\nω −ω n+1\nl\n) 4 +\nl−1∑\ni=1\nˆuik(ω ))]\nend for\nUntil convergence:\n\n\n ˆun+1\nlk (ω )−ˆun\nlk(ω )\n\n\n\n2\n2\n∥ˆun\nlk (ω )∥2\n2\n< ε 1, k =1, 2, . . ., C\nSet ˆλ 1\nk, ˆu1\nlk(ω ) ←ˆun+1\nlk (ω ), ω 1\nl ←ω n+1\nl , α m ←α min +em, n←0\nUntil α m ≤α max\nUntil ∑ C\nk=1\n[\n1\nT\n\n ulk(t)\n\n 2\n2\n]\n< ε 2\nfor digital sequence needs to be designed.

The Hadamard\nproduct of the power spectrum X and weight matrix W is the\ndata embedding Ed.\nIn the input layer, X is converted to a matrix E by summing\nthe position embedding Ep (the embedding method is the\nsame as BERT) and data embedding Ed. Dynamic coding is\napplied and all weights are automatically learned by training.\nWeights are ﬁrst initialized as random numbers that obey\nnormal distribution. After embedding and normalization, the\n(\nNc ×Np\n)\n×N (i.e., number of features ×number of time steps)\nmatrix is input to the encoder layer.\nIn the encoder layer, the number of layers (i.e., transformer\nblocks) is 12 and the hidden size is 768. The number of self-\nattention heads is 12. Batch size is set to 32 and the number\nof epochs in training loop is 10. The BERT model is built with\nMATLAB R2022a.\nEvaluation\nTo test the predictive ability of this approach for unknown\nseizures, limited seizures were used for training, whereas the\nremaining ones were for testing. All the data of iEEG portal\ndataset and labeled training data in Kaggle dataset could be used.\nBecause there were relatively few seizures for each subject in\nthe training data, a leave-one-out cross-validation method was\napplied. Namely, M-1 seizures were used for training and one\nfor validation if there were M seizures for a subject. The amount\nof interictal iEEG is much larger than preictal iEEG. Therefore,\nto avoid the problem of class imbalance, a number of preictal\nand interictal iEEG sequences were the same in the training\nset. Each interictal iEEG sequence was randomly selected from\nthe dataset. All remaining interictal sequences were used for\nvalidation. We run ten trials and train 10 models for each\nsubject (refer to\nLian et al., 2020 ). The average performance was\nconsidered as ﬁnal prediction performance when using training\ndata. We could also use unlabeled testing data of Kaggle dataset\nto test the prediction method. Similarly, we trained multiple\nmodels to avoid the problem of class imbalance. For each subject,\nall preictal iEEG and the same amount of randomly selected\ninterictal iEEG were used to train the model, and we run 10\ntrials. A testing segment in Kaggle dataset would be predicted\nas preictal iEEG, if more than 6 models identiﬁed it as preictal.\nNo labels are given for the testing data in Kaggle dataset,\nbut the score (an index related to classiﬁcation accuracy that\nused by the organizer) could be calculated on the competition\nwebsite. Therefore, the score we achieved on testing data is a key\nindicator of predictor performance.\nTo improve the reliability of the prediction, a prediction\nwindow of 10 min was applied. According to experiential\nknowledge [refer to (\nTruong et al., 2018 ; Wei et al., 2019 )],\nif more than 60% of EEG samples during 10-min continuous\nrecordings are identiﬁed as preictal, the warning alarm would be\nraised. To evaluate the performance of the prediction method,\nthere are four commonly used measures including sensitivity,\nfalse prediction rate (FPR), seizure occurrence period (SOP),\nand seizure prediction horizon (SPH). Sensitivity is the number\nof correctly predicted seizures divided by the total number of\nseizures. FPR is deﬁned as the number of false alarms per hour.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org\nWu et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnins./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum\nFIGURE /one.tnum\nThe architecture of BERT model.\nSPH is a predeﬁned interval between the ﬁrst alarm and the\nincoming seizure, which is also a period reserved for patients\nto take intervention measures. SOP is the period during which\na seizure is expected to occur (\nMaiwald et al., 2004 ). Therefore,\nfor a correct prediction, seizure would not occur during the SPH\nand must occur within the SOP. There are no common criteria\nfor the length of SOP and SPH, but the SPH should be long\nenough for intervention and the SOP should not be too long\nin case of patient’s anxiety. Based on prior knowledge of other\nstudies, we use the SPH of 30 min and the SOP of 20 min here.\nTo evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the seizure\nprediction performance, a random predictor is used for\ncomparison. For a given FPR, the probability to raise an alarm\nduring the SOP can be approximated as follows: (\nSchelter et al.,\n2006).\nP ≈1 −e−FPR·SOP (14)\nTherefore, the probability of predicting at least m of M\nindependent seizures by chance is given by\np =\n∑\ni≥m (M\ni )Pi(1 −P)M−i (15)\nFor each patient, p is calculated using the FPR and\nthe number of correctly predicted seizures m. If p is\n<0.05, the prediction method is considered signiﬁcantly\nbetter than a random predictor at a signiﬁcance level\nof 0.05.\nResults\nPreprocessing results\nMultivariate SVMD was applied for preprocessing. The\nrange of parameter α in SVMD was set to [200, 800] for\ncanine iEEG and [200, 2000] for patient iEEG. The eight\nscales of common intrinsic modes extracted from a randomly\nselected 2-s preictal iEEG of Dog_5 are shown in\nFigure 2A\n(only the ﬁrst 3 channels are displayed in the ﬁgure due\nto space limitations). Corresponding power spectrum density\n(PSD) of all 15 channels on each scale is indicated in\nFigure 2B. The frequency bands of modes on the same scale\nwere similar, which illustrated the mode-alignment ability\nof multivariate SVMD across multiple channels. The modes\nwhich could obtain the highest classiﬁcation accuracy were\nconsidered as eﬀective modes and the others were irrelevant.\nIrrelevant modes were removed and the remaining modes\nwere added up for reconstruction. It could be considered a\nkind of denoising.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org\nWu et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnins./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum\nFIGURE /two.tnum\n(A) The eight scales of modes extracted from a randomly selected preic tal iEEG sample by multivariate SVMD (only the ﬁrst /three.tnum channelsare\ndisplayed) and (B) PSD of all /one.tnum/five.tnum channels on each scale.\nPrediction results\nThe power spectrum of reconstructed data was input\nto BERT for deep learning and classiﬁcation. It is shown\nin\nTable 3 that this prediction algorithm achieves mean\nsensitivity of 0.86 and the average FPR of 0.18/h. The p-\nvalue indicated that the prediction method was signiﬁcantly\nsuperior to a random predictor for all subjects. The mean\nscore of our method on testing data of Kaggle dataset\nwas 0.84125, which was about 0.03 below the competition\nleader of 0.87154. The power spectrum of raw iEEG was\nalso input to BERT for classiﬁcation, to compare the\npreprocessing algorithms. The mean score on testing data\nwas 0.69153, which is, however, much lower than the\nproposed method.\nDiscussion\nMultivariate SVMD inherits the advantages of SVMD\nincluding less parameters, resistance to mode mixing and\nadaptability. Meanwhile, it could be seen from\nFigure 3 that the\nfrequency bands of modes on the same scale were similar, which\nillustrated the mode-alignment ability of multivariate SVMD\nacross multiple channels. Furthermore, modes in diﬀerent scales\nwere in distinctive frequency bands, which demonstrated that\nSVMD might have ﬁlter bank property, which is not the focus of\nthis study, but could be further proofed in the future.\nThe number of the intrinsic modes extracted by multivariate\nSVMD for some samples was not consistent, because of\nwideband iEEG signals with the eﬀect of ocular artifacts,\nelectromyogram, and other background noise.

Most of the interictal samples (75.6%)\nwere decomposed into 8 scales of band-limited intrinsic mode\nfunction (BIMF), whereas there was less consistency for preictal\nsamples on the number of modes. For both states, the center\nfrequencies of 8 dominant time scales were in the range of [0, 8],\n[8, 18], [18, 32], [32, 42], [42, 53], [53, 65], [65, 80], and [8 0, 110]\nrespectively. However, the proportion of samples containing\ncertain time scales of modes (modes in high gamma band) is\nsigniﬁcantly reduced in the preictal state, as shown in\nFigure 3.\nThe reason might be that some modes were interfered by the\nnew modes generated by an impending epileptic seizure, which\nneeds to be proved by exploiting more physiological evidence.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org\nWu et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fnins./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum/four.tnum/one.tnum\nIt can be seen from Table 3 that the diﬀerence of preictal\nand interictal modes shows speciﬁcity among all subjects. There\nis a certain consistency for Dog_1, Dog_2, and Dog_3, because\nall the irrelevant modes are in alpha and beta bands. However,\nmodes that are associated with seizures are in gamma band\nfor other subjects. Therefore, the seizure prediction method is\npatient-dependent due to the speciﬁcity of patients.\nAs summarized in the reference (\nUsman et al., 2019 ),\nsupport vector machine (SVM) was widely used in studies\nbefore 2019 with good predictive performance. LSTM was the\nmost commonly used model among deep learning models to\nsolve NLP problems and other time series pattern recognition\nbefore the emergence of BERT. Therefore, we compare the\nprediction ability of these two classiﬁers with BERT. SVM\nwith Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel is used by\nreference to the literature (\nBandarabadi et al., 2015 ; Xiang\net al., 2015 ; Sharif and Jafari, 2017 ). The LSTM network is\nconsisted of a sequence input layer, a LSTM layer, a dropout\nlayer, a fully connected layer using the “relu” activation function,\nand a classiﬁcation layer using the “softmax” activation. The\nsize of input layer is dependent on the number of power\nspectrum features. The dropout probability is 0.5. The number\nof memory units on the LSTM layer is set to 128 (\nTsiouris\net al., 2018 ). Although the mean sensitivity of SVM could\nreach 0.83, the score on testing data is only 0.65839. The\nTABLE /four.tnum The prediction performance of three classiﬁers (SVM, LSTM,\nand BERT).\nTraining data Testing data\nSensitivity FPR score\nSVM 0.83 0.24 0.65839\nLSTM 0.84 0.21 0.77930\nBERT 0.86 0.18 0.84125\nThe sensitivity and FPR in the table are the average of 10 subjec ts.\nprediction performance of both LSTM and BERT on testing\ndata is much better than that of SVM, which may due to the\nstronger learning ability of the two deep learning models for\ntemporal information. Moreover, BERT could achieve better\nprediction results than LSTM, as shown in\nTable 4. It illustrates\nthat BERT shows better performance in epileptic seizure\nprediction than LSTM.\nAs is shown in\nTable 5, for the canine iEEG dataset,\nthe sensitivity of this method is higher than that of other\nmethods, and the FPR of 0.20 is relatively low. It represents the\nhigh prediction performance of this method. The mean score\nachieved on testing data was 0.84125 with preprocessed data,\nwhile only 0.69153 with raw iEEG data, which illustrates that\nSVMD could screen out valid modes for seizure prediction.\nMeanwhile, it proved again that the diﬀerence between\npreictal state and interictal state of brain exists in the\npower spectrum of iEEG in time-frequency domain. The\nself-attention learning mechanism of BERT could extract the\ninformation eﬀectively. Although the result is comparable\nwith the work of Assi et al. there were only three subjects\nand complex feature extraction, and feature selection and\nchannel selection were used to predict seizures in that study.\nHowever, there are 10 subjects in the two datasets we\nused, and our method is relatively simple. Only the power\nspectrum of denoised iEEG by SVMD is used as features\nfor prediction.\nThe mean score obtained by the ﬁrst team is 0.87154 in\nthe Kaggle competition. Although it is about 0.03 higher than\nour method, their result is based on the numerous features and\nelaborate feature selection. The features include energy in\ndiﬀerent frequency bands, correlation of energy between\nchannels, square root of each feature, and so on (they only\nbrieﬂy introduced the features in the following websites:\nhttps://\nwww.kaggle.com/competitions/seizure-prediction/discussion/\n11024\n). However, features are learned adaptively in our method.\nThe score we achieved indicates that the proposed approach\ncould be a candidate or auxiliary method for seizure prediction.\nTABLE /five.tnum Comparison of seizures prediction methods using iEEG dataset.\nAuthors No. of subjects Features Classiﬁer Sensitivity FPR\nAssi et al.

The simple extension of SVMD\ncould decompose multivariate data into its common inherent\nmodes on diﬀerent scales. The iEEG signals were preprocessed\nby removing irrelevant modes after decomposition by SVMD.\nThe prediction score on Kaggle competition indicated that BERT\ncould learn the diﬀerence of preictal and interictal state in time-\nfrequency domain using the self-attention learning mechanism.\nTherefore, it could be a candidate method for seizure prediction.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are\nincluded in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries\ncan be directed to the corresponding author.\nAuthor contributions\nXW and TZ designed the study.
