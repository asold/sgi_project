  "abstract": "High-frequency (HF) transformers are an essential part of many power electronic devices. The performance and behavior of HF transformers can greatly affect the efficiency and performance of all systems, particularly, from a parasitic parameter point of view. In this article, HF transformers' parasitic parameters, such as leakage inductances and parasitic capacitances, are analyzed using a novel analytical method, finite element method (FEM), and experimental measurements of different structures and winding arrangements. Also, the magnetic field, electric field, electric displacement field, and electric potential distribution within the transformers are simulated and analyzed. Four different HF transformers with E and U cores with different windings are designed and analyzed. Investigation outcomes help to classify structures according to the trade-off between leakage inductances and series parasitic capacitances. This information can later be used for the optimal selection and design of transformers as a function of their operating frequency for any power rating and voltage level. Moreover, 3-D FEM and experimental results validate the proposed methodology to be used for designing HF transformers in high-voltage/power applications.",
