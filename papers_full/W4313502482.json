    "abstract": "Condition assessment for critical infrastructure is a key factor for the wellbeing of the modern human. Especially for the electricity network, specific components such as oil-immersed power transformers need to be monitored for their operating condition. Classic approaches for the condition assessment of oil-immersed power transformers have been proposed in the past, such as the dissolved gases analysis and their respective concentration measurements for insulating oils. However, these approaches cannot always correctly (and in many cases not at all) classify the problems in power transformers. In the last two decades, novel approaches are implemented so as to address this problem, including artificial intelligence with neural networks being one form of algorithm. This paper focuses on the implementation of an adaptive number of layers and neural networks, aiming to increase the accuracy of the operating condition of oil-immersed power transformers. This paper also compares the use of various activation functions and different transfer functions other than the neural network implemented. The comparison incorporates the accuracy and total structure size of the neural network.",
