INTRODUCTION\nSolid state transformer (SST) is an emerging technology\nthat could inﬂuence the developments in many areas such\nas smart-grids, traction systems, the system with renew-\nable energy sources (RESs) to mention just a few [1]–[3].\nSome advantages of SST when compared with low-frequency\ntransformer (LFT) include reactive power compensation,\nvoltage regulation, power ﬂow control, voltage sag com-\npensation, bi-directional power ﬂow, fault current limiting,\nharmonic block, and galvanic isolation [4]–[6]. One of the\nmost noticeable advantages of SST is the size and weight\nreduction. The contrast of their physical looks is shown in\nFig. 1. A comparison study shows that the 3 phase SST has\n80% lesser volume than a LFT [7], [8]. Volume reduction\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Amjad Anvari-Moghaddam\n.\nFIGURE 1. The physical looks of the high-frequency solid-state\ntransformer.\nof SST has signiﬁcant importance due to the portability, low\ninstallation cost, and easy to assemble in certain inconvenient\nareas such as off-shore transmission applications [9].\nSST converts an input of low frequency (LF) power to\nhigh frequency (HF) power through the switching circuits\nVOLUME 8, 2020 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

It can\nbe constructed into different power conversion depending on\nthe conﬁguration of the solid-state devices [10]. Hence, many\nconverter topologies have been proposed and analyzed in\ndifferent applications [11], [12].\nAll types of SSTs have the functions of isolated AC-AC\nconversion regardless of their differences in the design of\nconverter topologies [13]. All these topology designs are\nbasically categorized into single-stage, two-stage, and three-\nstage, as shown in Fig. 2 [8], [11], [14]. Single-stage SST\ntopology is a power conversion from high voltage alternating\ncurrent (HV AC) to low voltage alternating current (LV AC)\nthrough the HFT.\nIn general, the two-stage SST topology steps down\nthe voltage in AC-DC or DC-AC stage. Three-stage SST\ntopology is the most common conﬁguration and has the HF\nisolation in the DC-DC stage as it provides more power\nto meet the requirements of the smart transformer. Despite\nthat, three-stage topology exhibits low power efﬁciency\ndue to the presence of power converters which results in\nhigh conduction loss and switching loss [15]. In 2017,\nthe researcher introduced a single-stage AC-AC SST with\n97% efﬁciency [16].\nApart from that, the power device switch is not available\nfor the HV rating especially for the uses of power distribution.\nModular multilevel conﬁgurations based on input series and\noutput parallel (ISOP) are extensively used to address the\nissue by sharing the voltage and power in series connection,\nas shown in Fig. 3 [14].\nThe control strategies and balancing circuits are also\nrequired to prevent the problem in voltage and power bal-\nancing and that comes with drawbacks like complex systems\nin conﬁguration and control scheme [17], [18]. With recent\nadvances in power semiconductor technology, to avoid the\ncascading converter cells, FREEDM GEN II and FREEDM\nIII were developed by the two-level approach [18], [19].\nMany research and developments are ongoing in commercial-\nizing SST, investigating economic feasibility and reliability\n[19]. However, it still requires more research in order to\nimprove the SST performance and to achieve cost reduction\nusing different approaches [13]. Hence, this paper provides a\ncomprehensive analysis and quick understanding of the SST\nso that it could spark more interest among the researchers.\nA few prominent articles have been published to\ndescribe the design and effectiveness of the SST topology.\nWang et al. [20] highlighted the design and optimization of\nFIGURE 3. SST ISOP configurations (a) Single-stage; (b) Two-stage; (c)\nThree-stage [14].\n15-kV SiC IGBT and their impacts on utility application.\nHuang et al. [13] developed a 15-kV SiC MOSFET-based\nsingle-phase SST topology. Divan et al. [21]\ndesigned 12-kV–120/120-V based galvanically isolated\nsingle-stage SST topology for achieving grid-edge control.\nLiserre et al. [22] explained the SST modular structure,\ncontrol functionalities, and some challenges. Huang [23]\ndiscussed the MV SST technology and related functionalities.\nFerreira Costa et al. [24] analyzed the structure of a three-\nstage STS. Briz et al. [25] concentrated on two modular\npower converter design concepts; one is the cascaded-H\nbridge (CHB) and the other is modular multilevel converter\n(MMC) topologies. Huber and Kolar [11] discussed the ﬁve\nclasses of modern SST topologies including matrix type, iso-\nlated back end, isolated front end, isolated MMC and single\ncell-based HV SiC devices. The articles mentioned above\nfocused on developing some speciﬁc SST topology. However,\nthe comprehensive comparative analysis of different SST\ntopologies, their applications, implementation difﬁculties is\nnot explored in detail. Therefore, the major contribution of\nthis paper is to deliver a detail overview and analysis of SST\ntopologies with power/voltage level, updated information,\nimportant features, beneﬁts, drawbacks, and related applica-\ntions. A depth comparative study is performed considering\nthe important parameters such as cost, material, power loss,\nfrequency, efﬁciency, and various functional capabilities.\nIn line with that, this paper dives deeper to investigate the\ncurrent progress and challenges. Moreover, this review paper\nprovides recommendation for the future improvement of SST\nso that it could be widely adopted in the energy market.\nII. OVERVIEW OF SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMER\nThere are numerous SST topologies which are categories\nas single-stage, two-stage, and three-stage, respectively.\n19114 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nFIGURE 4. Classification of SST topology.\nMany of the SST topologies can convert the input of DC or\nAC to the output of DC or AC by replacing some or all of the\nswitches to allow for bipolar (AC setting) or unipolar (DC\nsetting) of voltage and current [14]. The classiﬁcation of SST\nis shown in Fig. 4.\nA. SINGLE-STAGE SST TOPOLOGY\nSingle-stage is the simplest SST topology which has only\na direct power conversion with transformer isolation to step\ndown the HV to LV. This type is operating in direct DC-DC\nor AC-AC power conversion stages with better efﬁciency and\nhigher reliability [26]–[28]. The direct DC-DC or AC-AC\npower conversion stages offer better efﬁciency and higher\nreliability than three-stage SST topology due to the absence\nof conduction loss and switching loss [15], [27]. This topol-\nogy has high switching frequency and does not require elec-\ntrolyte capacitor [29]. Single-stage topology uses the phase\nshift angle between the secondary and the primary bridges\nto control the direction and magnitude of power transfer. In\naddition, the bi-directional power ﬂow with four-quadrant\nswitches helps to improve the control strategy and regulate\nharmonic content [27], [30]. The phase-shift angle ϕcontrols\namount of power transferred to the load between two bridges,\nas shown below [27],\nP0 =vi,puv0,pu\nXpu\n(\nϕ−ϕ2\nπ\n)\n(1)\nwhere vi,pu and v0,pu denote the input voltage and output volt-\nage in per unit, respectively. Xpu denotes leakage reactance of\ntransformer in per unit. The ideal DC voltage transfer ratio is\ndetermined by,\nγ =v0,pu\nvi,pu\n=Rpu\nXpu\nϕ\n(\n1 −ϕ\nπ\n)\n(2)\nwhere Rpu represents load resistance in per unit. Neverthe-\nless, (2) cannot be applicable to AC–AC system when an\noutput ﬁlter exits. The base secondary-side impedance can\nbe expressed as Zb,sec =Sb/Vb,sec. where Sb and Vsec stand\nfor base power and base secondary-side voltage, respectively.\nIn view of (1), the steady-state operation of an AC system is\nFIGURE 5. AC-AC single-stage SST (a) Full-bridge converter (b) Flyback\nconverter [14].\nshown in the following equation,\nPi =vi,puˆii,pu =P0 =v2\n0,pu\nRpu\n+d\ndt\n(1\n2Cpuv2\n0,pu\n)\n(3)\nwhere Corepresents the output ﬁlter capacitance and Cpu =\nCo ·Zb, sec. The AC voltage transfer ratio can be determined\nby changing (3) into the frequency domain,\nγac = 1\nXpu\nϕ\n(\n1 −ϕ\nπ\n) Rpu\nsRpuCpu +1 (4)\nIt is observed form (4) that the AC voltage trans-\nfer ratio depends on the transformer phase shift between\nbridges, output ﬁlter, leakage inductance, and load resistance.\nIn steady operation, a small phase shift between input and\noutput voltages is introduced by the load and the output\nﬁlter. In addition, the output voltage follows the input voltage\nsinusoidally and this ratio holds irrespective of the input volt-\nage polarity and the transformer current direction since the\nAC–AC DAB converters use four-quadrant switching cells.\nFig. 5(a) shows the AC-AC full-bridge converter with sim-\nple control to convert the power into a HF square-wave with\n50% duty cycle and rectiﬁed to the sinusoidal waveform on\nthe LV side [31]. Fig. 5(b) shows the ﬂyback converter that\nhas a minimum number of switches.\nHowever, the major drawbacks are voltage stress on the\nswitches and DC link does not comprise to offer power factor\ncorrection [14]. Since the SST is aimed to achieve good\noperation in the medium voltage (MV) level such as 7.2 kV of\nAC; modular multilevel conﬁgurations are used to share the\nvoltage and power by connecting a number of LV converters\nVOLUME 8, 2020 19115\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nin series [11], [18]. However, its complex conﬁguration cre-\nates a balancing problem in power and voltage. Thus, the two-\nlevel approach in single-stage is designed in order to simplify\nthe system complexity and control scheme [16]\nB. TWO-STAGE SST TOPOLOGY\nThe main difference between single-stage SST and two-stage\nSST is the additional design of DC-link either on the HV\nside or the LV side. The power ﬂow is bi-directional; however,\nit can be modiﬁed into unidirectional by deploying an uncon-\ntrolled rectiﬁer at the LV side of the AC-DC converter [32].\nThis topology needs a complex switching method as well as\na large number of switching devices [33]. Though two-stage\nSST increases the system complexity; however, it has few\nadvantages such as reactive power compensation [34]. Since\nthe ZVS is difﬁcult to be maintained in such a wide input\nrange, two-stage SST with LVDC link is not suitable for HV\noperation. Although the lack of LVDC link is unsuitable for\nthe renewable application in LV, the issues can be addressed\nby converting the HVDC to LVDC instead of LV AC [35].\nFurthermore, another solution to this issue is by employing\nthe three-stage SST topology.\nRecently, a new AC-AC high frequency-based matrix\ntype three-phase input and three-phase-four wire output SST\nis proposed. In this topology, PWM is utilized to con-\nvert the utility source voltage to 50% duty square wave\npulses and then it is transferred through a single-phase high-\nfrequency transformer. This design offers some beneﬁts such\nas bidirectional power ﬂow, ﬂexible voltage transfer ratio,\ncontrollable input power factor, high power density, and\nelectrical galvanometer isolation. Furthermore, this topology\nhas the capability to reduce the harmonic distortion in both\ninput and output current under unbalanced load conditions\nby using modiﬁed three-dimensional spaced vector PWM\n(3D SVPWM) [36].\nC. THREE-STAGE SST TOPOLOGY\nThree-stage SST topology gains the most popularity in\nresearch compared to the other SST topologies due to the\nsmart features offered. Aside from lower volume and weight\nin this SST, it is also able to optimize the performance in\ndistribution and transmission grids [24]. The three-stage SST\ntopologies are designed with two DC links that are able to\naddress the power quality (PQ) issues and also supply and\nutilize any devices in MV or LV [37]. Table 1 shows the\npower and voltage level, conﬁguration, control, capabilities\nand applications of different SST topologies. A comparative\nanalysis among three topologies of SST based on numerous\nfunctional capabilities is illustrated in Table 2. It is noticed\nthat three-stage topology is superior to one stage and two-\nstage topology with regard to voltage regulation, current\nlimit, protection, and power factor. A number of SST projects\nhave been developed to facilitate the integration of renewable\nenergy and energy storage systems [13]. Fig. 6 shows one of\nthe applications that three-stage SST was implemented in an\nelectrical distribution grid. The architecture of the three-stage\nSST has at least two power converters which comprise with\nMV frequency converter, and LV converter, respectively.\nIn [38], the three-stage SSTs are typically designed for the\npurposes of smart grid applications in which it has bidirec-\ntional power ﬂow to transfer power from LV to HV [38]. The\nfeatures of each stage are fully described in the following\nsubsections.\n1) MEDIUM VOLTAGE STAGE (AC TO DC)\nThe medium voltage converter converts MV AC to MVDC\nthrough the rectifying process. The converter enables the\nSST to ﬁlter out the reactive power in the MV grid and\ntaking only the active power and feed it to the next stage.\nTable 3 shows the three available topologies which are the\ncascaded-H bridge (CHB), neutral point clamped (NPC),\nand modular multilevel converter (MMC) [22]. Three-level\nNPC is widely adopted in the industry which can be seen\nin applications like active power ﬁlters, STATCOM and also\nSST [39]. In the early stage of development, it required a large\nnumber of converters to be cascaded in MV application due\nto the limitation of the silicon IGBT available in the market\nthat has limited operating voltage up to 6.5 kV [40]. Thus,\nit leads to lower power efﬁciency, lower density and also\nhigher complexity in control when it is designed in a 3-phase\nstructure [41]. Table 4 presents the number of active and\npassive components used in different medium voltage SST\ntopology.\nHereafter comes with the SiC devices which are more\nefﬁcient than Si devices [40], [42], [43]. SiC MOSFETs are\nsuitable for lower power applications, while SiC IGBTs are\nthe candidates for high power applications due to the decrease\nin the efﬁciency of MOSFETs as power increases.\nHence, the SiC IGBT is selected to be used in a\nnon-cascaded three-level NPC grid-connected converter at\nMV as shown in Fig. 7. With less number of switching\ndevices, it increases the power density, efﬁciency, and con-\ntrol simplicity [42]. However, it brought to the challenges\nin maintaining the power quality at low current/low load\nconditions [61], [62].\nFigure 8 shows the CHB conﬁguration which is another\ntopology to realize the MV stage of the three-stage SST. The\nCHB conﬁguration emerged due to its simple modulation\nand control system [24], [63]. The total harmonic distortion\n(THD) could be lower as larger inductance was placed, yet it\nhas difﬁculties to implement such high value of inductance\nin MV and high power applications [42], [50]. It shares the\nsame trait as MMC, shown in Fig. 8, which has the possibil-\nity of fault-tolerance implementation, multilevel operation,\nreduced rate of change of voltage, and ﬁlter size [64]–[66].\nIn contrast to CHB, MMC has a complex control system,\nhowever, it provides the DC link for the connection of MVDC\nloads sources. Thus, it requires a bulky ﬁlter on the DC side\nwhich signiﬁcantly increases the overall cost of MMC [24].\nCHB and MMC are the modular approaches that can perform\nadvanced controls by unloading the devices that show higher\ndeterioration [22], [63].\n19116 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM.

Typical smart transformer in electrical distribution grid [37].\nTABLE 4. Components comparison of medium voltage three-stage SST\ntopology.\nMoreover, there are two MMC approaches where the\nsubmodule could be chosen to be implemented with the\nhalf-bridge or full-bridge shown in Fig. 9(b) and Fig. 9(c).\nHalf-bridge MMC uses fewer power devices and provides\na higher step-up ratio at the same time [68]; however, the\naverage device voltage stress is four times that in full-bridge\nMMC. Furthermore, all the submodule capacitors in full-\nbridge MMC are always active (keep charging or discharging\nFIGURE 7. MV grid-connected converter with 3L-NPC converter [37].\nFIGURE 8. (a) MV grid with CHB converter [22]; (b) H-bridge cell [50].\nall the time), while the submodule capacitors in half-bridge\nMMC have one inactive state [67].\n2) LOW VOLTAGE STAGE (DC TO AC)\nIn LV stage is used to convert the LVDC to LV AC in which\nthe power fed to and from the second-stage (DC/DC MF\nTransformer). Most often, the output of the LV stage is load\nconsumption. The main advantage of this stage is the control-\nlable output waveform by shaping the DC to an AC waveform\nwith a desired nominal amplitude and frequency. In other\nword, this stage is able to regulate the voltage waveform to\na ﬁne voltage waveform on the LV side freely from the\n19118 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. A.

Three-stage SST with the ancillary system in LV stage [22].\nsystems connected to the distribution grid and any other\ndisturbances [70]. Furthermore, LV stage has many other\nancillary services provided such as regulation of grid fre-\nquency, on-line load identiﬁcation, and control, voltage based\noverload control, soft load reduction, and reverse power ﬂow\nlimitation as shown in Fig. 10 [71].\nFirstly, the load identiﬁcation could estimate the load\nsensitivity to voltage variations in real-time and then provide\nmore accurate control action for other ancillary services. The\nsoft load reduction is able to reduce the load active power con-\nsumption upon request whereas the voltage-based overload\ncontrol could prevent overload in power consumption. All\nthe ancillary services are acting as the catalysts for the SST\nto be employed in many smart applications. The amount\nof output power being control upon to meet the desired\npower by sensing the variation of power and frequency\n[24]. Half-bridge (HB) topology is the simplest approach.\nStandard inverter topologies, regardless of the two-level\napproach or three-level approach, can be employed in\nFIGURE 11. Categories of a medium frequency converter.\nthis stage. Hereafter, the NPC which is the three-level\napproach is the most recommended one which enables the\nuse of 600-V power devices and eventually increases the\nefﬁciency of the system [22].\nA three-phase four-leg PWM converter is proposed for the\nLV stage. The four-leg converter topology is an appropriate\nchoice for achieving accurate control for a neutral current,\ncontrolled rectiﬁer. The four-leg converter outperforms the\nconventional three-leg converters in terms of the degree of\nfreedom and better control capability [72].\nThe LV-side converter controllers are used to regulate the\nﬁlter capacitor voltages with stable frequency, even in the\npresence of unbalanced load/generation currents. To achieve\nthis, the current and voltage are changed into three sym-\nmetrical components such as positive sequence, negative\nsequence, and zero sequence in order to control the negative\nand zero sequence component of current and voltage occurred\ndue to unbalanced conditions. After, the controller of each\nsequence is executed and accordingly negative-and zero-\nsequence capacitor voltage is permanently assigned to zero to\ncancel these components under the appearance of unbalanced\ninput currents and load conditions [73].\n3) MEDIUM FREQUENCY CONVERTER\nIn this stage, MF converter serves as the power ﬂow between\nthe MV and the LV grid by balancing between the two stages\nmentioned above. The input and output at both the converters\ncould be DC or AC depending on the design requirements.\nIt is considered as one of the most challenging stages due\nto the high-power performance required to cater for the high\ncurrent on the LV side, while the high voltage on the MV\nside. There are two solutions to address the requirements, one\nby using the HV rating devices whereby the second solution\nis by cascading several modules to share the total power,\nvoltage and current which are a modular concept [22]. The\nadvantages of modular concept over the ﬁrst solution are the\nlow electromagnetic interference emission and the realization\nof using LV-rating power devices, which increase the fault\ntolerance in this stage [22].\nA number of converters have been studied to be used\nas modules for this stage, which are the series resonant\nconverter (SRC), dual-half bridge (DHB), dual-active bridge\n(DAB), asynchronous-quadruple-active bridge (AQAB), and\nsynchronous quadruple-active bridge (SQAB), as shown in\nFig. 11 and Table 5 [22], [74]. All the converters listed\nVOLUME 8, 2020 19119\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nTABLE 5. Comparison of MF converter topologies in three-stage SST.\nhere are able to achieve soft-switching, high efﬁciency, and\npower density. However, this paper focuses only on four\ntypes of converters as they received more attention from\nthe researchers than other topologies. DHB is the topology\nthat has the least number of power devices which comprises\ntwo half-bridge converters while DAB comprises two full-\nbridge converters each connected to one side of the medium\nfrequency transformer [75].\nDAB converter is superior in output voltage and power\nﬂow control because it works with active control of the\ntransferred power. AQAB is similar to DAB; however, less\nnumber of power devices are used because it integrates more\nactive bridge to a single transformer. Thus, some power\ndevices in AQAB are high-power rated. According to [74],\nthe system cost could be reduced by approximately 20%. SRC\nis conﬁgured either in half-bridge or full-bridge whereby\nthe difference for both bridges is explained in [80]. Besides,\nSRC operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to\nreach the most efﬁcient operating point [81] by achieving\nZVS, zero-current switching (ZCS) and low current switch-\ning. However, the major challenge of using SRC is the lack\nof capability to control the power ﬂow. According to [81],\nthe input voltage can be controlled through the ﬁrst stage of\nSST once the system has enough degrees of freedom. It leads\nto the open-loop operation which makes the system simpler\nand inexpensive because of the number of sensors can be\nreduced [81].\nAccording to the recently reported works, the DAB with\nSRC has the highest power efﬁciency up to 98.61%, provided\nthe SST is implemented in three stages which include the\nfront-end rectiﬁer as the ﬁrst stage [81] AQAB has been\nreported to achieve 97.5% power efﬁciency whereas DAB at\n92.5% [74]. SRC could reduce the number of sensors used\nand present better power efﬁciency, whereby QAB could\nreduce the number of power devices. It is possible to have a\ncombination of QAB with SRC to achieve higher power efﬁ-\nciency and cost-saving concurrently. Further research work\ncould be carried out in order to explore the possibility of\ndemonstrating the hybrid QAB-SRC design.\nFIGURE 12. High-frequency isolation converter.\nTABLE 6. Comparison of core material.\n4) HIGH-FREQUENCY TRANSFORMER\nHF transformer is the core of the SST, where it tremen-\ndously reducing the total volume and weight compared to\nthe conventional LFT [82]. This advantage could be achieved\ndue to the fact that the high frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld\nonly requires a small size of winding [83]. In this small size\ntransformer, there is no contact between the primary and sec-\nondary sides of the converter, thus the isolation strength of the\ntransformer could be improved [84]. Based on Fig. 12, the HF\nAC is generated from the ﬁrst converter (DAB, SAB, and\nothers) and direct to the HF winding. Hereafter, the magnetic\nwave generated from the primary winding cuts across the\nsecondary winding thus generates the desired voltage level\nat high frequency, then only being converted to LF through\nanother converter. Noted that it has the same concept in a\nconventional transformer; however, it operates in HF.\nTo optimize the HFT for the best performance, three cru-\ncial design considerations are required which are the core\nmaterial, wire selection, and winding placement. To mini-\nmize the core loss and avoid core saturation for the nominal\noperation points, the core material must be selected carefully\nas it affects the size, power density, and power loss in the\ntransformer [34], [85].\nBased on Table 6, the higher the ﬂux density, the higher\nthe power density. Silicon steel material has the highest ﬂux\ndensity but experiences high power loss; Soft ferrite material\nhas moderate power loss; however, the lowest density which\nrequired a bigger size core. Amorphous material has a good\nﬂux density; however, power loss is high when operating in\nhigh power applications. Nanocrystal line material has an\naverage ﬂux density and the lowest power loss. It is obvious\n19120 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nTABLE 7. Specifications and configurations of MV SST design under different companies.\nthat the nanocrystalline material is the most acceptable core\nmaterial in terms of power density and efﬁciency; however,\nthe cost for this material is relatively high. The second alterna-\ntive would be the amorphous material which is not suitable for\nthe high-power applications. Moreover, it was shown that the\npower loss for core material could be optimized by regulating\nthe frequency range [86].\nUnder HF, the skin depth gets smaller than the wire\ndiameter; however, the skin effect could not be ignored.\nAccordingly, Litz wire is chosen to reduce the impact of\nskin effect by subdividing the conductor to smaller conductor\nstrands with proper shields [91]. Several hundreds of tiny\nstrands are insulated from the others and form a thicker\nwire with the thickness equal to the wire size which is then\ncalculated in volt power calculations [86]. It is important to\nknow that the thinning of the wire strands would result in a\nbetter performance in HF characteristics. As yet in the market,\nthe thinnest Litz wire strand could go down to 50 American\nwire gauge (AWG).\nDesign consideration of the HF converters also depends\non the types of transformer winding geometry such as\nsolenoidal and coaxial winding [92], [93]. Although the coax-\nial type has advantages in terms of controllability; however,\nthe solenoidal structures are the most recommended ones due\nto lower cost and easier manufacturing. There are different\nsolenoidal transformer structures which are core-type, shell-\ntype and matrix-type, respectively. Core-type has greater\ninsulation between primary and secondary sides; shell-type\ncould provide better mechanical protection; matrix-type has\nthe multiple cores which have the capability for inter-wiring\nfeatures that help to reduce leakage inductance and winding\nAC resistance [34], [94]. The winding placement on the core\nand the distribution of wire turns is another key parameter\nwhich is taken into consideration in the design of HFT. The\nmutual inductances and the coupling coefﬁcients of the wind-\nings are inﬂuenced by the winding placement which has a\nsubstantial impact on power loss and system efﬁciency.\nOne of the main issues to design a HFT is the isolation\nbetween primary and secondary voltage zones. Also, sev-\neral power electronics converters for grid integration not\nonly rises the cost, size, failure rate but also increases the\ncontrol complexity of the system. To address the above\nproblem, a multi-port solid-state transformer (MPSST) can\nbe employed. MPSST is a type of SST that uses a multi-\nwinding HFT to develop an adjustable, modular, isolated and\ncompact converter to utilize multiple elements in the power\ngrid. In addition, the functionality of several converters is\ncombined in one converter, thus minimizing the number of\ncomponents, and increasing the power density in the system.\nA MPSST can act like a centralized controller that can control\nthe power ﬂow and regulate the voltages [95], [96].\nD. AVAILABLE SST DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS\nThe applications of the SST in different power conversion\ntopologies have been discussed in the literature [57],\n[97]–[109]. The detailed speciﬁcations of many well-known\nMV SST designs are depicted in Table 7, including designs by\nSiemens [97], Bombardier [102], Alstom [103], GE Global\nResearch [104], UNIFLEX [105], ABB PETT [106], ETH\n[107], EPRI [108], Hubei Lab [98], ABB [98] and the\nFREEDM System Center [99], [100], [109] Table 4 clearly\ndemonstrates that the SST is a disruptive and enabling device\nfor a wide range of MV applications. There are two key\naspects in the design of an SST like modularity and number of\nstages. Accordingly, Table 4 shows that the modular and two-\nlevel converter conﬁgurations are widely used in SST design\nto withstand the high input voltages at 7.2 kV and 15 kV.\nIn switching conﬁguration, IGBT and SiC MOSFET are\nmostly used for SST design. In recent years, SiC MOSFET\nis highly preferable in designing SST due to their higher\nelectric ﬁeld strength, fast switching capability and ultra-low\nswitching loss. A detail performance comparison among four\nwell known SST designs including UNIFLEX, EPRI, GE and\nFREEDM is depicted in Table 8. It is observed that GE is\ndominant in other SST designs in terms of efﬁciency, control\ncomplexity, fault and harmonic isolation due to the frequency\ncommutation in the high voltage rectiﬁer with customized\nSiC MOSFET.\nIII. CONTROL OPERATION OF SST\nUnlike conventional LFT, external control is needed\nto operate the SST. There are different controllers,\nVOLUME 8, 2020 19121\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nTABLE 8. Comparison of functionalities of four well known SST designs.\nFIGURE 13. Control block diagram for phase modules of multi-level\nSST [111].\noperate independently on each of the stages. Most often,\nclosed-loop control is only considered in the control tech-\nniques for the purpose of synchronization and ensures the\npower quality [110]. In multi-level SST control, the rectiﬁer\n(First stage AC DC) is controlled based on the sensed input\nvoltages, currents, and HV DC capacitor voltages (between\nﬁrst and second stages) in order to maintain desired power\nfactor at the input terminal of second stage converter as shown\nin Fig. 13. Next, the second-stage conversion is controlled by\ncomparing the sensed output voltage with the desired voltage;\nthus, generating different control signals to produce the\ndesired output at the input terminal of three-stage. Similarly,\nin the three-stage (AC-DC), the controller senses only the\nvoltage and current at the output side to generate the required\ncontrol signals for the converter.\nIn the HV rectiﬁer side, a number of topologies such as\nNPC, CHB, and MMC have been discussed where MMC\nhas the most complex control. The NPC topology senses the\nwaveform from input and output to generate a PWM control\nsignal [112]. CHB is controlled using a single-phase vector\ncontrol method [111]. Meanwhile, MMC requires not only\nthese basic signals but also greater number of measurement\nthan CHB and NPC such as the measurement of cell capacitor\nvoltages, DC current, arm current, AC currents, and AC\nvoltages [113]; resulting the MMC topology is more costly\nand higher control complexity, respectively.\nIn general, a DAB controller maintains a constant volt-\nage at the secondary side of the DC-link while supplying\nthe desired load power. In DAB, it comprises two H-bridge\nconverters and a high-frequency transformer whose leakage\ninductance enables the bidirectional power ﬂow. The con-\ntrol method of the DAB is based on the switching of each\nfull-bridge using complementary constant PWM signals with\nFIGURE 14. Load identification and control scheme for LV side\nconverter [71].\nTABLE 9. Performance comparison of controllers [114].\nrectangular modulation [75], [99], [111], [113]. Moreover,\nthree modulation techniques could be used in DAB whereby\nanother two modulation techniques have been developed for\nDAB with SRC [78]. For DAB, the power transfer and output\nvoltage can be calculated and correlated to the characteristics\nof the power devices, as shown in (5); however, for DHB, it is\nshown in (6) [111].\nP =nv1v2\n8fsLs\nd (1 −d) (5)\nP =nv1v2\n2fsLs\nd (1 −d) (6)\nwhere n is the transformer turns ratio, V1 is the HVDC\nvoltage, V2 is the LVDC voltage, d is the phase shift ratio,\nfs is the switching frequency of power devices, and Ls is\nthe leakage inductance. From the calculation, the LVDC can\nbe controlled by adjusting the phase shift ratio and applying\nthe PI regulator to sense the difference between the output\nvoltage and its reference values [111].\nIn LV inverter side, the converter is controlled by means\nof a voltage and a current control loop to keep the AC volt-\nage as a sinusoidal waveform with constant amplitude and\nfrequency with any load condition. The control requirement\nfor this converter is low and almost negligible compared to\nthe control part in the ﬁrst-stage and second-stage [113].\nHowever, the researchers found that the load identiﬁcation\nand control could further improve the voltage and current\ncontroller in real-time providing more accurate control action\nfor other ancillary services as shown in Fig. 14 [1].\nBesides, Haritha et al. (2018) demonstrated controller per-\nformance comparison [114] where a PWM signal is generated\nby comparing the output voltage and the reference voltage\nusing PI, PID or fuzzy logic controller. Table 9 shows the\nPI controller has an advantage in terms of settling time and\nrise time, while the PID controller has merit in terms of\npeak overshoot. However, the fuzzy logic controller has the\n19122 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. A.

TRENDING APPLICATIONS OF SST\nSST technology is emerging with a lot of potential beneﬁts\n[64], [65], [115]. In this section, different SST applica-\ntions have been organized into a few categories. Most of\nthese applications exploit the advantages of SST in terms\nof controllability, smaller space needed, and the synergy of\nco-existence of both AC and DC systems. Fig. 15 shows\nthe SST-based system conﬁguration for future energy deliv-\nery, management, and communication between smart grids,\nconverters, RES, protection devices and loads, respectively.\nThis system can operate in SST-enabled mode or island-\ning mode. SST is adopted to replace the conventional\nlow-frequency transformer and rectiﬁer/ inverter because of\nits better controllability.\nA. RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE\nRenewable Energy Sources (RESs) are gaining increasing\ninterest due to the awareness in conserving energy for the\nfuture generation [116]–[118]. Some of the RESs are gener-\nated as DC power and require the power conversion (inverter)\nwhich would decrease the power efﬁciency. In addition,\na bulky converter is also required in order to be connected to\nthe conventional power grid. In this context, the replacement\nof a conventional power transformer by SST is the solution\nto all these issues. More importantly, most of the RESs are\nnot harvested all the time and the conventional types of RES\nsystem would disconnect during overvoltage conditions. The\nSST provides a solution by controlling the power output and\nthe power could still be generated [67].\n1) SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATION\nThough solar PV generates a low voltage, there is a number\nof effective options to connect solar PV to load or network.\nTo address the issues, either the low-frequency transformer\n(50 or 60 Hz) is utilized or large photovoltaic arrays are\nemployed. Nevertheless, each of these approaches has its own\nnegative points. Hence, SST technology with high-frequency\nFIGURE 16. Solar PV system SST topology with DHB [124].\nAC link has proven to become an alternative choice instead\nof low-frequency transformers [119]. A number of research\nworks have already been reported on SST implantation in\nSolar PV applications. In [120], a dual active bridge inverter\ntopology based solar PV panels employed to SST is proposed.\nIn [121], the utilization of SST in grid-connected photo-\nvoltaic systems is introduced. In [1], a modular converter\nbased on SST applied in PV module arrays is proposed\nwhere high-frequency transformers are utilized instead of\nbulky medium-voltage line-frequency ones. The applica-\ntion of SST in solar PV can also be found in [55], [122]\nwhere SST with solar PV brings many beneﬁts, such as\nreduced size and weight, enhanced reliability, easier main-\ntenance, voltage amplitude improvement the grid current\nquality enhancement.\nIn the solar photovoltaic (PV) system, the current is\ngenerated in DC and converted into AC through either cen-\ntralized or separated inverters. To reduce the cost, most of\nthe conventional large-scale PV power plants are utilizing\ncentral inverters to reduce the number of power devices and\ncontrollers needed. Furthermore, only one maximum power\npoint tracker (MPPT) is used in the centralized inverter stage\nfor the solar PV power plants which result in the system to\nmeet the maximum power of the PV modules association;\nhowever, it does not achieve the maximum power for each\nindividual PV module [123]. To address the partial shading\nissue, it is suggested that the MPPT is installed on each PV\nsystem; however, this will result in a higher cost. Hence,\nit was reported that a cascaded multilevel SST topology\n(two-stage) is developed by deploying DHB which is able\nto achieve the galvanic isolation and MPPT function [124]\nas shown in Fig. 16. The DHB is cost-effective because it has\nused fewer power devices in the topology. Although the DHB\ncould retain more reactive power; however, as solar panels\ndo not produce reactive power, the disadvantages of reactive\npower of DHB would not be considered as a factor.\nFurthermore, another topology is using a boost converter\nin the input stage to serve as the MPPT function and DAB in\nthe isolation stage [123] as shown in Fig. 17. This topology\nis used for the high power application; because the DAB\ntopology can realize zero-voltage switching of power devices\nwhile minimizing the loss caused by the hard switching in\nthe circuit [125]. Hereafter, another work suggested a three-\nstage SST topology implemented with a boost converter\nwhich provided more features [125]. All the approaches could\nincrease efﬁciency, reliability, and offer more advanced fea-\ntures than the conventional approach.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 19123\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nFIGURE 17. Solar PV system SST topology with the boost converter and\nDAB [123].\nFIGURE 18. Three-stage SST with SAB in WECS [114].\n2) WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM\nA few major factors that the SST being proposed for the\nwind energy conversion system (WECS) are the reduction\nof weight and volume, voltage step-up and the extra func-\ntions that SST could offer such as reduction in ﬂuctuation\nof voltage, voltage regulation, and compensation of reactive\npower which results in the improvement of PQ events [4],\n[83]–[85]. There are different types of WECSs in the market;\nhowever, only the WECS based on doubly fed induction\ngenerator (DFIG) is the most widely adopted because of its\nvariable speed, constant frequency operation and small size\nwith high MV A ratings [129]. Due to the PQ issues that were\nexplained in [130], [131], and the stepping up of the voltage\nwhich requires a large conventional transformer that is unac-\nceptable; accordingly, SST has a huge potential in wind as\nwell related applications [65]. However, it is necessary to use\nthree-stage SST topology for WECS as shown in Fig. 18 due\nto the fact that most of the wind generators are producing\nAC power. The three-stage SST topology is comprised of a\nrectiﬁer, MF converter, and inverter using either single active\nbridge (SAB) or DAB topology. The reason for using SAB\nis to reduce the circuit complexity by alleviated control for\npower devices. Moreover, a fuzzy controller is suggested for\nthe implementation due to the higher performance than other\ncontrollers [114].\nB. MICROGRID APPLICATION\nThe importance of DC power continues to increase, and many\nresearches have proposed on the DC distribution system to\nshift the AC grid to the DC grid [132]. However, it is nearly\nimpossible to change AC grid to DC grid instantly. Hence,\nthere are researches that proposed the hybrid AC/DC system\nwhere the three-stage SST was implemented [133]. SST is\nonly suitable in the microgrid (MG); However, not in a smart\ngrid because of the limitation in power devices. Moreover,\ncompared to the LFT, SST is much lighter, more compact,\nand has higher power density which makes it very suit-\nable for widespread use in power distribution systems [134].\nAnother great advantage of using SST is the integration\nof energy storage systems and distributed energy resources\n(DERs), which could enhance the PQ and increase power\nefﬁciency, leading to a stable system operation [135].\nMany researches have been done on three-stage topology\n[70], [134], [131]; however, only a few for two-stage topology\n[136] in some applications. With the connected energy stor-\nage and DERs, SST in MG can be operated either in islanded\nor in grid-connected modes with seamless transition [134].\nHowever, it leads to stability issues like the variation in fre-\nquency that is caused by the growing number of DERs, loads,\nenergy storage that are connected at one point. Accordingly,\nthere are two power-sharing methods were developed in\nwhich multiple SSTs can share a given change in load by\ngenerating appropriate feasible set points for the input stage\nrectiﬁers [137]. SST serves as a good alternative to replace\na conventional transformer in MG; however, the imple-\nmentation needs to be reviewed comprehensively before it\ncan be widely adopted due to the high cost which is not\neconomically feasible. In addition, HV devices are required\nin order to develop SST in HV applications such as smart\ngrid. Nonetheless, it is believed that it takes time to develop\nthe high-power rating of power devices before SST could\nbe implemented in HV application. As the demand for SST\nis increasing in different ﬁelds, it is expected that the cost\nwould tremendously be reduced to a more economically\nviable level.\nC. TRACTION APPLICATION\nLocomotive traction application is likely to be one of the\nscientiﬁc researches to work on with possible effort in size\nand weight reduction while possibly making it more power-\nefﬁcient. As for now, many of the applications are AC-fed\ntraction vehicles which are based on 50Hz or 16.67 Hz; thus,\nintroducing a bulky transformer installed in the system. With\nreference to a 6 MV A machine, the weight to power ratio is\nroughly 1.58 kg/kV A for 50Hz system and 1.81 kg/kV A for\n16.67 Hz system [138]. Hence, the weight of the transformer\naffects the overall power efﬁciency. Thereby, SST is then\nstudied with the motivation to reduce the weight and size of\nthe overall system to achieve higher power density and efﬁ-\nciency. Apart from that, SST in traction application realizes\nfour-quadrant conversion stages while preserving the similar\nfeatures of conventional line frequency transformer.\nThere are traction applications implemented with SST\ndeveloped by ABB, Bombardier, and Alstom [138]. Most of\nthe prototypes were designed with single-stage (AC-DC) or\ntwo-stage (AC-DC-DC) by considering the MF stage as one\nstage. A number of modules comprise with IGBTs and being\ncascaded depending on the voltage rating. There are a number\nof factors that the SST is still not widely adopted into the\ntraction application; although it is able to improve efﬁciency.\nOne of the major factors is the power ratio; which is relatively\npoor compared to the traditional line frequency transformer\n[138]. MMC concept had been introduced to greatly reduce\nthe weight and size of the system and offer more features;\n19124 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nFIGURE 19. Structure of SST-based PVCS [140].\nhowever, the MMC concept required more power devices\nwhich resulted in higher cost [138], [139].\nNonetheless, the emerging technology in a semiconductor\nsuch as silicon carbide (SiC) devices can possibly accelerate\nthe process of adopting SST in traction applications. It is sug-\ngested that the switching frequency of power devices could\nbe increased to 10-25 kHz or possibly more which relatively\nincreases its performance. Moreover, the total cost could be\ngreatly reduced to be more economically viable in the market\nby minimizing the overall number of power devices, passive\ncomponents (capacitors from DC link and SR circuits) and to\nachieve higher efﬁciency at the same time.\nD. OTHER FUTURE APPLICATIONS\nThere are many other future applications that could be\nrealized such as hybrid AC/DC system, airborne wind tur-\nbine, portable transformer, subsea processing, EV, naval\n[115], and aircraft with SST. As there are many DC appli-\ncations in mankind’s daily usage, so it is a great move to have\na hybrid system that could supply and consume AC or DC.\nAs suggested in [140], photovoltaic-assisted charging station\n(PVCS) could be one of the important charging facilities\nfor the electric vehicles as shown in Fig. 19. This allows\neasy communication between the PVCS with the utility grid\nthrough the SST, better energy management, and power\ncontrol.\nBesides, there is also a new kind of wind power generation\nthrough the airborne wind turbine (AWT) which is popular\nas airborne wind energy systems (AWESs). Compared to the\nconventional wind turbine, AWT generates electricity from\nthe higher altitude winds which are known to be faster and\nmore stable than the winds close to the ground level. Thus,\nit provides a more reliable and effective generation of elec-\ntricity [141]. There are two types of AWTs [142] such as a\ngenerator on the ground and generator in the air as shown\nin Fig. 20.\nGenerator in the air type AWT has the advantage of trans-\nferring electric power through the weather. It not only reduces\nthe power loss but also increases the required mechanical\nstrength which is connected to the ground station. Hence,\nthe SST could reduce the total weight of the aircraft, and also\nFIGURE 20. AWTs (a) Generator on ground; (b) Generator on-air [142].\nFIGURE 21. Electrical design for AWT.\nconvert voltage to high voltage to reduce power loss. Different\nAWT schematic designs are shown in Fig. 21 [96], [98].\nThe power optimization is one of the factors to implement\nin the subsea applications that required power for oil and gas\nprocessing, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and off-shore\nwind power. To solve the above issues, SST could present a\ngood solution for all these applications. The subsea applica-\ntions required power to be transferred or received from the\nshore or topside which was connected by the power cable.\nAs a result of long-distance, the system experiences higher\npower loss in HV AC; thus, the application may need a plat-\nform or ﬂoater. SST technology with DC power transmission\nis able to transfer the power in a longer distance which\nreduces the cost of building a platform by just installing the\nlonger HVDC cable from the seashore to the subsea. Besides,\nthe cost can be further reduced using SAB; because, SAB\nreduces the number of power devices with unidirectional\npower ﬂow [144].\nAlthough there are portable site transformers present in\nsuch an era; they are still bulky and heavy. However, introduc-\ning SST, it is not only able to reduce the weight and volume;\nbut also provides other features that before-mentioned. With\nall these advantages, the applicability of SST is high and\ncould be implemented in submarine, naval, and even in the\nelectric aircraft technology in the future.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 19125\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nV. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES FOR FUTURE SST\nIMPROVEMENT\nThe main aim of the advanced SST is to provide a high level\nof ﬂexible control to optimize power transfer technology.\nHowever, it has been observed that several issues signiﬁcantly\naffect SST performances in terms of cost-effectiveness, efﬁ-\nciency, reliability, protection, communication compatibility,\nand scalability. Some identiﬁed key issues and challenges of\nthe advanced SST are discussed in the following subsections.\nA. ECONOMICS FEASIBILITY\nSST offers a number of great advantages due to the usage\nof solid-state devices such as IGBT, MOSFET, etc. However,\nthese brought another big drawback in which the cost is high\nin SST than the conventional LFT. One of the estimation\nmaterial costs of a 100kV A SST is at least 5 times higher\nthan those of an equally rated LFT [7]. To address this,\nthe topology SST has to choose wisely on different kinds of\ntopology. For instance, the solar farm is suggested to use two-\nstage SST if the smart features do not require, thus reducing\nthe number of power devices uses. Besides, the single-stage\nSST can implement on any application if only the reduction\nof weight and volume, and the simplest control is required to\nreplace the LFT. As for now, potential applications could be\nfocused on smart grids and renewable energy [145].\nTo further reduce the cost of SST, it is possible to reduce the\nvolume of heat sinks and passive components by using low\nvoltage switching devices with low loss characteristics and\nhigh-frequency operation [146]. Moreover, there is no need\nfor a current sensor to being implanted as the current sharing\nstrategy is used by using the active power component of the\nduty cycle in the rectiﬁer stage as the feedback signal for the\npower balance controller in the DC-DC stage [147].\nThe emerging technology in a semiconductor such as SiC\ncould possibly accelerate the process of adopting the SST in\ndifferent applications such as traction. Thanks to its charac-\nteristics of SiC, the total cost could be greatly reduced to\nbe more economically viable in the market by minimizing\nthe overall number of power devices, passive components\n(capacitors from DC-Link & SR circuits). In certain parts of\nSST which could be further investigated such as MF converter\nwho has different topology to implement. For instance, it was\nsuggested to combine the AQAB with SRC to further reduce\nthe overall cost. Furthermore, increasing market size could\ntremendously reduce the SST price from the economy of\nscale, but it is still required more research in price reduction\nin other approaches.\nB. OVERALL PERFORMANCE\nThe performance of SST nowadays generally has a\nhigh-power density compare to LFT. However, two-stage\nand three-stage SST has lower efﬁciency, as there are many\npower conversions taking place. In addition, SST reliability is\ngenerally low as there are still many testing and research only\nrun in a short-term period. Long-term testing and research are\nrequired for SST. To fully implement the SST to smart grid,\nit would not be realized at this moment due to the solid-state\ndevices could not able to cater the high voltage. Hereafter,\nmodular SST could able to resolve the issues but the amount\nof power devices is required which causes the high cost and\nPQ issues. However, a single-cell approach could be real-\nized with the arise of SiC power semiconductor technology\n[28], [103]. The single-cell approach is great; however, still\nexperiencing reliability challenges due to the difﬁculty of\nimplementing redundancy in a non-modular system [11].\nHence, more study is required on the semiconductor side in\norder to fully implement in HV application.\nC. SST PROTECTION\nThe reliability and robustness are two key factors to consider\nfor SST before being widely adopted in the market. The\nSST protection reliability is relatively low when compared\nto the LFT due to the lack of protection for overvoltage and\novercurrent. It is much more complex in SST as it may expe-\nrience some possible failures such as control errors, measure-\nment errors, or insulation breakdown. Due to this possibility,\nadditional external protection devices are required. However,\nthese external devices relatively increase the total volume\nof the design, which compensates the advantages of volume\nreduction in this case. Alternatively, a less robust could be\nconsidered if advanced protection devices (solid-state circuits\nbreakers) are used [149]. Thus, it is still a step to move in SST\nProtection before the SST could fully implement in the grid\nwithout compensating the advantages of SST features.\nThe lightning protection system (LPS) for a STS comprises\nboth internal lightning protection measures and external light-\ning protection measures. The internal lightning protection can\nbe achieved by dividing the STS into lightning protection\nzones (LPZs). The concept of LPZs is based on electromag-\nnetic compatibility (EMC) of an object. This immunity of the\nelectrical equipment determines the deﬁned EMC values. The\nLPZs allows the conducted and ﬁeld-bound interference at\nthe boundaries to be decreased to deﬁned values. In line with\nthat, the protected object is divided into two protection zones.\nThe ﬁrst zone LPZ 0A is determined by the rolling sphere\nmethod where the parts may be exposed to a direct lightning\nstrike. The second zone is known as the LPZ 0B where parts\nare protected from direct lightning strikes. One the other\nhand, the external lightning protection system can be obtained\nby using the air-termination method, down conductor method\nand earth-termination method [150]–[152].\nD. ELECTRICAL INSULATION AND PARTIAL DISCHARGE\nA HFT has less space, compact design and uses enamelled\nmagnet wire to which corona resistant insulation layer may\nbe employed. Inter-turn and turn-to-ground insulation of HFT\nexhibit high voltage and high-frequency electrical stress,\namounting to 5-40 kHz. Furthermore, the operating tempera-\nture of HFT can raise to 150-200 ◦C under increased dielectric\nloss with frequency [153]. Hence, signiﬁcant impacts are\nnoticed on insulating material in HFT under high-frequency\n19126 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. A. Hannanet al.: State of the Art of SSTs: Advanced Topologies, Implementation Issues, Recent Progress and Improvements\nvoltage which results in premature insulation failure. The\ninsulation failure caused by the high-frequency PWM wave-\nform reduces the life cycle due to the accelerated aging,\nelectrical stress, overvoltage, and heating [154].\nPartial discharge (PD) is the main responsible factor for\noccurring the insulation deterioration in HV systems or LV\nones where overvoltage or surge may take place [155]. The\nworks in [156] found that PD behaviour and insulation life are\ninﬂuenced by the voltage frequency. Another work in [157]\nreported that the reduction in PD amplitude can be found in\nthe frequency range of 50 Hz-1 kHz. In addition, the reverse\nelectric ﬁeld and reversal moment of voltage polarity increase\nPD phenomenon [158].\nE. COMMUNICATION COMPATIBILITY\nMany advanced protection concepts often involved the\ncommunication between the SST, circuit breakers, and other\nswitching devices in the grid. However, speciﬁc character-\nistics of SST are quite important to adopt in the grid envi-\nronment in order to reach the protection scheme. It is not\neasy to implement such adaptions in the existing distribu-\ntion grids and would be costly to do so [159]. Hence, it is\nimportant to know that at the moment, SST could not be a\ndirect replacement for a LFT in the distribution grid as more\nresearch required investing in the communication part.\nF. SST IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES\nSST generates voltage unbalance on the DC side at no-load\nor light-load conditions which are the main limitation of the\ncascaded H-bridge converter operation. This voltage unbal-\nance has a signiﬁcant impact on the percentage of real power\ndifferences. Moreover, SST is still in the development stage;\nneed to improve their efﬁciency and cost-effectiveness and\na new standard for commercial potential. Thus, SST imple-\nmentation at different levels is an issue. However, in the long\nrun, SST could enable an unprecedented amount of two-way\npower ﬂow which will be a revolutionary achievement for\nsmart grids.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe review outlines a detailed investigation of STS\ntopologies, controller operation, associated application\nand implementation problems to identify their substantial\ncontribution in renewables and further deregulated energy\nmarket. The review starts with a comprehensive expla-\nnation of different SST topologies, conﬁguration, power\nand voltage ratings, advantages, disadvantages, and related\napplications. The structure of various medium voltage and\nmedium frequency power converters, their operation, number\nof components, merits and demerits, cost and efﬁciency are\nanalyzed. The review also explains the operation and design\nrequirements of HFT along with power losses under different\nmaterials, composition, and temperature effects. The most\nrecent published papers on well-known MV SST are reviewed\nwith regard to type, operation, voltage, frequency, switching\nconﬁguration, and functional capabilities. After, the review\nhighlights the various controller operation of SST. Then, the\nexecution of different SST topologies in the ﬁeld of solar\nPV, wind power conversion and transmission, traction, smart\ngrid, MG, and DC charge station is discussed. Finally, key\nfactors of SST implementation are identiﬁed concerning cost,\nefﬁciency, protection, and insulation.\nThis review has proposed some signiﬁcant and selective\nsuggestions for the further technological development of SST\nand their development in future applications, such as:\n• Economics feasibility study of advanced SST needs to\ninvestigate further for quantitative evaluation of data\ncollection, validation, communication, ﬁltering, calibra-\ntion, protection, PQ, data dissemination and cyberse-\ncurity requirements as well as to estimate the payback\nperiod. Moreover, the advanced SST combined with\ncheaper high conﬁgured power electronic devices will\nsupport the economic feasibility of SST for replacing\nconventional transformer as well as promotes a signif-\nicant development and application of the SST.\n• In the future, SST would be a key component for\nsmart grids in controlling the electricity routing and\nnew functionalities to the distribution grids. Thus, SST\ncould be designed for revolutionary functionalities of the\nsmart grid to mitigate PQ problems, improve reliability\nindices, reactive power compensation, and efﬁciency.\n• In the next-generation electric power system, large RE\nintegration would change the grid energy management\nsystem. SST could be used as an energy router in order\nto manage supply and demand efﬁciently in the smart\ngrids. Thus, a SST with a high level of functionalities as\nan energy router could be designed in terms of usages\nand functions in different domains considering power\nelectronics, communications, grid intelligence, and net-\nwork protocol requirements.\n• The overall efﬁciency of the SST is experiencing\nreliability challenges as SST still in research and testing\nlevel. Thus, an advanced scalable SST model, its algo-\nrithm, mathematical formulation of optimization prob-\nlems and control strategies are needed to be designed\nto ensure the efﬁciency improvement without affecting\nthe stability and reliability of the grid as well as provide\nhigh-performance behaviour under different operating\nconditions.\n• SST’s fast current limiting is very important for\nprotection and blackout prevention using fast load reduc-\ntion schemes of the grids. However, due to limited\novervoltage and overcurrent capabilities, SST requires\nadditional protection devices compared to conventional\nLV transformer protection schemes. As SST has not\nyet been economically justiﬁed, therefore, it needs an\nadvanced protection device including ﬂexible control\nfunction of the protective relay, sufﬁcient inductive ﬁl-\nters and the impact of the time latencies on the overall\nprotective scheme.\n• Real-time communications between the SST and\nthe power devices are very important for power\nVOLUME 8, 2020 19127\nM.

Thus,\nan advanced compatible communication system for\nSST is required to be designed for intelligent energy\ninformation dissemination. The communication system\nmust satisfy the transmission latency, reliability, and\ninformation security.\nThese recommendations would be a signiﬁcant\ncontribution towards the development and implementation of\nadvanced intelligent SST, their control approach and appli-\ncations which would provide a concrete idea for researchers\nand manufacturers on the advancement for the future devel-\nopment of SST.\nREFERENCES\n[1] N.
