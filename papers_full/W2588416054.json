Transition has received a lot of attention from pro-\nfessionals and researchers alike, not least because there is \nevidence that a significant proportion of patients never suc-\ncessfully transfer to adult services. Successful transition \nfrom paediatric to adult care requires engagement from the \nyoung person, their family and both paediatric and adult \nhealth care teams as the young person becomes increas-\ningly autonomous [1–4]. Assuming responsibility for their \nhealth is part of that process, which necessitates a level \nof understanding and appreciation of what their condition \nentails and of what their cardiac anatomy looks like [5]. \nHowever, it is widely accepted that adolescents typically do \nnot have adequate knowledge of their condition [6–9]. Edu-\ncation and knowledge about their CHD are key to achieving \na successful transition to adult services, particularly as poor \nknowledge limits young people’s ability to communicate \nconfidently with clinicians and thereby to engage fully with \nthe health services they require [10–12]. In this context, \nAbstract This pilot study aimed to assess the impact of \nusing patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) models of \ncongenital heart disease (CHD) during consultations with \nadolescent patients. Adolescent CHD patients (n = 20, age \n15–18  years, 15 male) were asked to complete two ques-\ntionnaires during a cardiology transition clinic at a special-\nist centre. The first questionnaire was completed just before \nroutine consultation with the cardiologist, the second \njust after the consultation. During the consultation, each \npatient was presented with a 3D full heart model realised \nfrom their medical imaging data. The model was used by \nthe cardiologist to point to main features of the CHD. Out-\ncome measures included rating of health status, confidence \nin explaining their condition to others, name and features \nof their CHD (as a surrogate for CHD knowledge), impact \nof CHD on their lifestyle, satisfaction with previous/cur -\nrent visits, positive/negative features of the 3D model, and \nopen-ended feedback. Significant improvements were reg-\nistered in confidence in explaining their condition to others \n(p = 0.008), knowledge of CHD (p < 0.001) and patients’ \nsatisfaction (p = 0.005). Descriptions of CHD and impact \non lifestyle were more eloquent after seeing a 3D model. \nThe majority of participants reported that models helped \n * Giovanni Biglino \n g.biglino@bristol.ac.uk\n1 Bristol Heart Institute, School of Clinical Sciences, Bristol \nRoyal Infirmary, University of Bristol, Upper Maudlin Street, \nBristol BS2 8HW, UK\n2 Cardiorespiratory Division, Great Ormond Street Hospital \nfor Children, NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK\n3 Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College \nLondon, London, UK\n4 School of Medicine, King’s College London, London, UK\n814 Pediatr Cardiol (2017) 38:813–818\n1 3\npatient–doctor communication is a complex process, essen-\ntial to the delivery of high-quality care and directly impact-\ning on patient satisfaction and adherence [13, 14]. Cardiol-\nogy terminology, however, can be difficult to understand for \nthe non-specialist and difficult for the specialist to explain \nin a non-patronising but understandable manner [15], and \nthis can be further exacerbated by the invisibility of the car-\ndiac lesion.\nTechnological advances in the realm of three-dimen-\nsional (3D) printing technology enable the manufacture of \npatient-specific models from medical imaging data. Recent \nwork has shown the acceptability and feasibility of manu-\nfacturing CHD patient-specific models, reporting a positive \nexperience for communicating with families in a clinical \nsetting [16]. In this study, 3D models were well liked by \nparents and were considered to be more meaningful for the \nnon-expert with respect to medical imaging data. Another \nrecent study discussed the importance of involving all \nstakeholders in the technology (including patients and fam-\nilies) to evaluate the potential of 3D models for facilitating \npatient–doctor communication [17].\nIn this context, the present pilot study aimed to assess \nthe impact of providing a patient-specific 3D model of their \nCHD to patients, during a transition clinic. We hypoth-\nesised that seeing and manipulating a patient-specific, 3D \nmodel would result in improved anatomical appreciation, \nimproved ability of the young person to describe their \nCHD, and overall improved communication between the \npatient and the cardiologist.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients\nThe pilot study involved adolescent patients with CHD \n(n = 20, age range 15–18  years, 15 male) at the time of \nclinical consultation during a transition clinic. Patients pre-\nsented with a range of CHDs: tetralogy of Fallot (n = 5), \ntransposition of the great arteries (n = 5), aortic coarcta-\ntion (n = 3), pulmonary atresia (n = 3), aortic stenosis with \ndilated ascending aorta (n = 2), double outlet right ventricle \n(n = 1), and Ebstein’s anomaly (n = 1). Young people were \neligible to participate if they were aged between 14 and \n18 years, had a primary diagnosis of CHD and had recent \ncardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging data suitable \nfor producing a patient-specific 3D model (see Interven-\ntion). Potential participants received an information sheet \nat home prior to their appointment, explaining what the \nstudy was about and that they might be approached to par -\nticipate while in clinic. Written consent/assent, depending \non participants’ age, was obtained prior to administering \nthe survey and parents provided the consent for their child’s \nparticipation for those young people under 16 years of age. \nThe study was approved by the National Ethics Research \nService local committee (REC REF 13/LO/1569).\nSetting\nThe study involved completion of questionnaires, facili-\ntated by a Research Administrator in the outpatient clinic \nof a specialist paediatric hospital, together with the pres-\nentation of unique 3D heart models to patients during their \nconsultation with the clinician. The brief questionnaire \ncould be completed on paper or an iPad and was adminis-\ntered before the clinical appointment, and repeated once the \nparticipating patients had seen their clinician and had been \npresented with their model during their consultation.\nIntervention\nA 3D model was created from CMR data of all identified \npotential study participants, according to the steps of image \nsegmentation and volume rendering explained in detail \nelsewhere [18]. Models were generated from the 3D steady-\nstate free precession (SSFP) whole heart sequence or from \nthe angiogram sequence of the CMR examination, depend-\ning on image quality. All models were reconstructed by \nthe same operator using commercial image-reconstruction \nsoftware (Simpleware Ltd, Exeter, UK). Models included \nthe whole heart and main vessels, except for cases of aor -\ntic coarctation and aortic stenosis with dilated ascending \naorta, in which it was deemed more effective to highlight \nthe area of interest (i.e. narrowing/ dilatation of the aorta) \non a model including the left ventricle and the aorta to the \nlevel of the diaphragm (i.e. left side only). All models were \nprinted with white nylon using selective laser sintering \ntechnology (3D Systems ZPrinters, Rock Hill, SC, USA). \nExamples of models from the study are shown in Fig. 1.\nOn the day of their clinic visit, patients were approached \non arrival and, having provided consent, completed the first \npart of the questionnaire, focused on evaluating their per -\nceived health status and their current knowledge of their \nCHD. Questions were 5-point Likert-type, yes/no or free \ntext, and included ratings of health status, confidence in \nexplaining their condition to others, name and features of \nthe CHD, the effect of the CHD on their lifestyle and satis-\nfaction with previous visits.\nPatients subsequently saw their cardiologist for routine \nconsultation and all were shown their 3D model, which was \nused to describe their anatomy and their CHD. A control \nmodel (i.e. full heart model with no CHD) was also pro-\nvided to the cardiologist and it was up to his/her discretion \nto use it to further aid in the conversation.\nAt the end of their appointment and having held, \nobserved and interacted about their 3D model, patients \n815Pediatr Cardiol (2017) 38:813–818 \n1 3\ncompleted the second part of the questionnaire. All pre-\nvious questions were asked again, in addition to an item \nenquiring as to their service satisfaction for the current \nvisit. Patients were also asked to rate on a 5-point Likert \nscale their agreement with statements relating specifically \nto the model, including the 3D model “was fun”, “helped \nme understand my condition”, “improved this visit com-\npared to previous ones”, and “made me more anxious about \nmy condition”. They were also asked to name three good \nfeatures and three things that could be improved about the \nmodel, and whether they would want to use it in future vis-\nits and would recommend it to a peer with CHD. Finally, \nthe questionnaire offered participants an opportunity to pro-\nvide additional feedback about the models and the service.\nPatient and Public Involvement\nThe survey was designed both for paper and for an iPad \n(iSurvey, harvestyourdata.com) based on feedback received \nfrom a parents’ focus group, indicating that the iPad could \nbe more engaging for the adolescents. The survey was \ndesigned with a patient representative, to ensure readabil-\nity, friendliness and appropriateness of the questions, suit-\nability of the language, and overall length of the survey.\nData Analysis\nEach patient acted as his/ her own control, comparing dif-\nferences before/after consultation, hence also indirectly \ncomparing previous visits (i.e. no 3D model) with cur -\nrent visit (i.e. with 3D model). Results are presented as \ncounts, proportions and mean ± standard deviation, where \nappropriate. Wilcoxon-signed rank tests were performed \nto compare responses of the two sections of the question-\nnaire, with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Par -\nticipants’ knowledge was quantified based on the correct \nname of the primary diagnosis, correct naming of associ-\nated keywords, and/or correct identification of features on \ndiagrams, marking one point for each correct name, key -\nword or identified anatomical feature and summing the \npoints. This was performed independently by two observ -\ners. Furthermore, content analysis was performed to ana-\nlyse the free text responses provided by the participants.\nResults\nThe majority of participants (>75%) rated their health sta-\ntus as ‘well’ or ‘very well’ prior to their consultation.\nConfidence in explaining their condition to others sig-\nnificantly improved following the consultation with the 3D \nmodel (p = 0.008). Importantly, a significant (p < 0.001) \nimprovement in knowledge was also registered after con-\nsultations. In no instance was a reduced knowledge score \nregistered. The level of participant satisfaction following \nthe visit improved significantly overall (p = 0.005), either \nincreasing or remained constant. In no instance was satis-\nfaction lower than for previous visits. These findings are \nsummarised in Fig. 2.\nParticipants generally felt that their condition had little/\nno effect on their lifestyle and only half (n = 10) reported \nsome limitations in taking part in sports activities. How -\never, following their appointment, all participants (n = 20) \nmentioned lifestyle effects, providing much more eloquent \nreplies, and reported limits in socialising, being asthmatic, \nnot being able to get a tattoo or drinking alcohol socially, as \nwell as limitations in playing rugby or running.\nThe majority of participants reported that 3D models \nwere fun and useful for their understanding, and a tool that \nimproved their visit. A non-negligible 30% participants, \nhowever, indicated that the model made them feel more \nanxious about their condition (Fig.  3). Nevertheless, par -\nticipants reported that they would want to have a 3D model \nfor future visits and they would recommend it to a peer \n(Fig. 3).\nFig. 1  Example of 3D whole \nheart models manufactured by \nmeans of 3D printing, showing \na normal heart from a healthy \ncontrol for comparison purposes \n(a); a model of transposition of \nthe great arteries repaired with \narterial switch operation with \nLecompte manoeuvre (b); a \nmodel of repaired tetralogy of \nFallot (c)\n\n816 Pediatr Cardiol (2017) 38:813–818\n1 3\nFeedback from the young people was very informa-\ntive (Table  1).

This pilot \nstudy sought to evaluate patient attitudes toward the models \nand the impact that seeing their own 3D heart model had at \nthe time of consultation with their cardiologist. Evaluation \nof patient preference and model efficacy, in terms of poten-\ntial knowledge improvement, are necessary steps toward \ndemonstrating the clinical benefit of the technology and its \npotential for clinical translation.\nOverall, patients responded very positively to the \nmodels, and questionnaire results indicated significant \nincreases in both their confidence in explaining their con-\ndition to others as well as in their knowledge. Also, their \nnarrative was considered to improve following their visit, \nbased on the interpretation of improved descriptions of \nlifestyle limitations that had become more eloquent. The \nincrease in articulate responses about how CHD may affect \npatient lifestyle in the follow-up questionnaire suggests an \nimprovement in the participant self-narrative. Patients were \nbetter able to identify ways in which their lifestyles were \naffected, following exposure to 3D models. Interestingly, \nno reduction in knowledge was observed, which could indi-\ncate that seeing the 3D models did not generate confusion \nin the patients. On the other hand, it could be argued that \nthe improved narrative is a result of the whole consulta-\ntion, therefore suggesting that the models helped facilitate \na conversation between the young person and the consult-\nant, resulting in improved engagement, e.g. feeling more \nempowered to ask questions. Helping young people to take \nresponsibility for their health is an important part of their \ntransition to adulthood and increasing engagement, knowl-\nedge and confidence about their heart condition are key ele-\nments of that.\nWhilst generally liking the models, some patients \nreported increased anxiety regarding their condition after \ntheir visit. This is not necessarily a negative feature, as it \nmay indicate increased awareness as a result of the more \nin-depth conversation facilitated by the model. This may \nalso suggest that a psychologist or adolescent nurse spe-\ncialist should be involved in translating the technology \nclinically. Patient anxiety related to the use of the mod-\nels should be addressed in future research, to determine \nhow the models may be leading to increased anxiety and \nwhether any increase is a direct or indirect consequence \nof using the models. Potentially, consultation with a psy -\nchologist or adolescent nurse specialist prior to partici-\npant selection could identify risk in some patients, and \nthe possibility for 3D model use being counterproductive \nin some patients should be taken into consideration. Also, \nit is not known whether the anxiety level in these patients \nwas actually linked to the information that they received \nduring their consultation, as this was not explicitly asked \nin the questionnaire.\nParticipants provided valuable feedback indicating \npositive features of the 3D models with regards to under -\nstanding the anatomy and size of the heart, appreciating \nthe personalised and unique quality of the model. In their \nfeedback they also provided suggestions for improving \nthe models if they were to use one again; in particular, \nhalf the respondents suggested the use of different colours \nwhich may be more familiar to them from other informa-\ntion sources such as pamphlets and books (e.g. red and \nblue vessels, typical textbook depiction of a heart). This \ncould be helpful for distinguishing different parts of the \nheart and the vasculature more immediately. It was also \nsuggested that different sizes should be explored (n = 2) \nand labels should be included on different parts of the \nmodels (n = 1).\nFrom a methodological and logistical perspective, \nreconstruction of the imaging data would take a dedi-\ncated operator between one to two hours, and models \ncould be printed within 48 h. The average cost of a model \nwas £150, depending on the volume of the part. From \na cost perspective, it could also be argued that if mod-\nels were to facilitate the consultation process and result \nin improved patient adherence, the cost of a 3D model \nshould be weighed against the cost of missing an appoint-\nment or non-adherence to other aspects of the treatment \nregimen. This remains speculative in the absence of an \nappropriate cost-effectiveness analysis. Nevertheless, \nrecent evidence confirms that the proportion of young \npeople lost to follow-up is a result of the need for formal \ntransition programs, corroborated by the need for better \neducation about CHD in adolescent patients [19].\nModels can not only help making something invisible \n(i.e. the CHD) visible, but making something invisible \nreal, allowing patients to view and manipulate an exact \nreplica of their heart. As a visual aid, this can contrib-\nute substantially to personalising the health message, \nconfirmed by the fact that some participants stressed in \ntheir feedback that they were impressed by viewing their \nown heart, rather than a generic or lesion-specific model. \nModels can also create a common ground between the \nyoung person and the cardiologist, removing some of the \npower imbalance from the consultation setting, in keep-\ning with involving all stakeholders in the translation of \nthe technology [17].\n818 Pediatr Cardiol (2017) 38:813–818\n1 3\nLimitations\nThe study population is relatively small, limiting the gener-\nalisability of the results, and whilst it includes some com-\nplex cases of CHD it does not include any single ventricle \npatients, which would likely be another group of patients \nbenefiting from seeing a model of their anatomy. The sur -\nvey focused on young people’s response to the 3D models \nin a clinical setting, without any further follow-up, so the \nimpact on future adherence to medical care or improved \nlifestyle cannot be predicted from these data. However, this \nwill be the subject of future research.\nConclusion\nAdolescent cardiac patients appreciated 3D patient-specific \nmodels of their heart and vessels at the time of consulta-\ntion during a transition clinic. A questionnaire indicated \nimprovements in confidence, knowledge, narrative and \npatient experience, suggesting that clinical translation of \n3D models for communication purposes warrants further \nexploration in larger studies.\nAcknowledgements The authors kindly acknowledge the gener -\nous support of the Royal Academy of Engineering, National Institute \nfor Health Research, and Heart Research UK.
