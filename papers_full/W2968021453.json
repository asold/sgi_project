INTRODUCTION  \nA plate on a rising elastic foundation is a common type of \nstructure when designing the foundation of civil works. \nAnalysis of this problem is related to the solution of the \ndifferential equations that describe it. Finding a simple \ncalculation method that still yields accurate results is the topic \nof this research. The combination of Kirchhoff's classic plate \ntheory with Finite Difference Method (FDM) has been the \ntopic of many studies. Authors in [1] proposed the application \nof FDM to study of the phenomenon in the theory of thin \nplates. Authors in [2] analyzed rectangular thin plates by using \nFDM. In [3] FDM was proposed to analyze a rectangular steel \nplate. The plate was considered to be subjected to an arbitrary \ntransverse uniformly distributed loading and was considered to \nbe clamped on two opposite edges and free at the other two \nedges. Authors in [4] presented an investigation of the validity \nof FDM on simulations of a thin sectorial steel plate under the \neffect of uniform and concentrated loads with different types of \nboundary conditions. Authors in [5] analyzed the rectangular \nKirchhoff plate on Winkler foundation using Finite Fourier sine \ntransform. The plate was assumed homogeneous, isotropic, and \nsimply supported at the four edges. Analysis of plate on a rising \nelastic foundation is an also interesting topic. Authors in [6] \nproposed simple computer analysis of circular rafts under \nvarying axisymmetric loading and elastic foundation conditions \nand authors in [7] analyzed the circular tank foundations with \nFDM. In [8], authors used finite element approach to study \nelastic soil-structure interaction. Finite and infinite dynamic \nplate-soil interaction, flexible and rigid plates on homogeneous, \nlayered or Winkler soil were studied in [9]. Finite/infinite \nelement analysis of a thick plate on a layered foundation was \nproposed in [10]. One can conclude that the research on the \nanalysis of rectangular plates on resting Winkler and two-\nparameter elastic foundation models by using FDM is still \nlimited. Therefore, this study aims at analyzing rectangular \nplates on resting Winkler and two-parameter elastic foundation \nmodels by FDM. The Matlab program combines the \nKirchhoff’s classic plate theory, Winkler foundation model, \ntwo-parameter foundation model, and FDM. In addition, this \nresearch also compares the calculation results of the two \nfoundation models and investigates the change of plate height \nratio to plate size.  \nII.  T\nHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  \nA.  Finite Diffrence Method \nFDM is a popular numerical method due to its \nstraightforward approach and minimum requirements regarding \ncomputer resources. It is based on a mathematical \ndiscretization of the equations of boundary problems. The \ncontents of the method are to replace the derivative by a finite \nestimation. This method is sufficiently accurate for thin plate \nanalysis [11, 12].  \nB.  Elastic Foundation Models \nThe elastic foundation is modeled by a one-, two- or many-\ndimensional elastic spring. Several mathematical descriptions \nof the elastic foundation are proposed in [12, 13]. In this \nresearch, the Winkler model and the two-parameter elastic \nfoundation will be presented and used. \n1)  Winkler Foundation Model \nWinkler foundation model was proposed in [14]. It is based \non the assumption that the foundation’s reaction q(x, y) at any \npoint ( x, y) on the plate is directly proportional to the \ndisplacement w(x, y) at the point, and the proportionality \nconstant k, called Winkler modulus, is a constant for the entire \nCorresponding author: Tron g Ha Nguyen \nEngineering, Technology & Applied Science Research  Vol. 9, No. 4, 20 19 , 4490 -449 4 4491   \n  \nwww.etasr.com  Nguyen : Analysis of Rectangular Plates on Resting  Winkler and Two -Parameter Elastic Foundation …  \n \nfoundation (or the foundation modulus) as shown in (1): \n( ) ( ), , q x y kw x y =     (1) \n2)  Two-Parameter Elastic Foundation Model \nTwo-parameter elastic foundation model was proposed in \n[5, 15]. The foundation reaction is shown in the following \nexpression: \n( ) ( ) ( )\n2, , , q x y kw x y T w x y = − ∇   (2) \nwhere k and T are the foundation model parameters. \nEquation (2) can be rewritten for rectangular or circular \nfoundations: \n( ) ( ) ( )\n2\n2\n,, , d w x y q x y kw x y T dx = −   (3) \nEquation (2) can be rewritten for the Hetenyi foundation as \n[5]:  \n( ) ( ) ( )\n4\n, , , q x y kw x y D w x y = − ∇   (4) \nwhere \n( )\n3\n212 1 \np p \np\nE h D\nµ\n=\n−\n is the flexural rigidity of the elastic \nplate and k is Winkler modulus. k  and D are the model \nparameters. Ep and µp are the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s \nratio of the plate material, and hp is the plate thickness. \nEquation (2) can be rewritten for the Pasternak foundation \nas [15]: \n( ) ( ) ( )\n2, , , q x y kw x y G w x y = − ∇   (5) \nwhere, G is the shear modulus of the shear layer. k and D are \nthe Pasternak foundation model parameters.  \nEquation (2) can be rewritten in two-parameter Pasternak \nfoundation form as: \n( ) ( ) ( )\n2, , , sq x y kw x y k w x y = − ∇   (6) \nwhere k is the first elastic foundation parameter (Winkler \nmodulus) and ks is the second elastic foundation parameter. \nC.  Classical Thin Plate Theory (Kirchhoff) \nAnalysis of a thin plate subjected to loads acting normal to \nits surface requires solution of differential equations of three-\ndimensional elasticity. Authors in [17] proposed the exact \nbending analysis for thin plates. However, this method is \nsomewhat complex and time-consuming. To overcome the \nabove disadvantages in technical applications, Kirchhoff’s \nclassical theory of thin plates yields sufficiently accurate results \nwithout the need of carrying out full three-dimensional stress \nanalysis. The governing differential equation for deflection of \nthin plates by Kirchhoff’s theory is [18]: \n( ) ( )4 ,,\nzp x y w x y D∇ =     (7) \nwhere w denotes the deflection in z direction due to the load zp \non surface x-y. D is the flexural rigidity of the elastic plate \nexpressed as: \n( )\n3\n212 1 \nEh D\nµ\n=\n−\n. In this expression: E is the \nmodulus of elasticity of the plate material, h is the thickness of \nplates, µ is Poisson’s ratio for the plate material. Equation (7) is \nsolvable by using FDM. \nIII.  M ETHODOLOGY  \nA.

Flowchart \nThe steps taken on the analysis of a rectangular Kirchhoff \nplate on an elastic foundation are: \n• Assume displacement and make finite difference grid. \n• Replace the corresponding partial differential equations (8)-\n(9) of the problem at the same transform with the finite \ndifference equation or difference equation. \n• Establish algebraic equations with the displacements as \nvariables \n• Solve the system of equations to determine the \ndisplacement. \n• Determine stress and deformation from displacement by \ndifferential method. \nFigure 3 shows the respective flowchart. \n \nFig. 3.

Uniformly distributed load was p=−100kN/m 2and \nYoung’ modulus was E=2.1×10 5MPa, while Poisson’s ratio of \nthe plate material was µ=0.3.
