  "abstract": "During the process of promoting the integrated construction of \"information, indicators, and operations,\" Chinese police department faced the real challenge of accelerating the development of new productive forces in public security. Coupled with the rapid development of Large Language Models and AIGC, driven by data and algorithms, public security intelligence work was constantly pressured to incorporate evolutionary technologies, internalizing the characteristics of Large Language Models tools into the core driving force for the improvement of institutional systems and business capabilities. Influenced by Large Language Models technology, public security intelligence work faced issues and risks such as data security, algorithm \"black boxes,\" and lack of legal regulation. To avoid these risks, this paper, based on an in-depth analysis of the technical logic of Large Language Models and exploring their impact on public security intelligence work and application risks, focused on exploring governance strategies. It proposed constructing a governance system with public security organs as the main body leading and other diverse entities cooperating, creating a \"human-machine collaboration\" operation mode, to promote Large Language Models to better adapt to the application scenarios of public security intelligence work.",
