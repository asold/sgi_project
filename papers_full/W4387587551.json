INTRODUCTION \nMalignant melanoma is a type of skin cancer characterized \nby abnormal growth of skin cells , [1]. If not diagnosed early, \nmalignant melanoma has a high mortality rate , [2]. \nAccording to data released by the World Health \nOrganization, in 2019 alone, there were 104,350 reported \ncases of skin cancer and 11,650 deaths in the United States , \n[3]. Research has shown that early treatment of malignant \nmelanoma can significantly reduce the mortality rate of \npatients, [4]. Dermoscopy is an essential tool used by \nphysicians for diagnosing skin cancer , [5]. It helps reduce \nthe reflection effect on the skin surface, providing doctors \nwith clearer and more detailed images of lesions. This \nenables dermatologists to observe deeper characteristics of \nthe affected areas. However, melanoma shares very similar \nfeatures with other skin diseases, and even experienced \ndermatologists can achieve an accuracy rate of only around \n75% in diagnosing melanoma using dermoscopy , [6]. \nTherefore, the diagnosis of melanoma remains a time -\nconsuming and error-prone process. \nIn recent years, researchers have proposed artificial \nintelligence (AI)-assisted diagnostic methods to help physicians \nachieve faster and more accurate diagnosis of melanoma , [7]. \nUnlike traditional methods, such as the 7-point checklist [8] and \nthe ABCD rule [9] that rely on color and shape of the lesion \narea for classification, the AI -assisted diagnostic methods \nutilize deep features extracted from images to classify skin \ndiseases, [10]. However, the extraction of deep features from \nimages faces the following challenges: (1) the contrast between \nnormal skin regions and lesion areas in dermoscopy images is \nlow, making it difficult for a neural network to focus on the \nskin lesion area during feature extraction; (2) dermoscopy \nimages often contain artifacts such as body hair and blood \nvessels, which greatly affect the extraction of meaningful \nfeatures; (3) the intra-class variation of lesion area features is \nhigh, while the inter -class similarity of lesion area features \nbetween different classes is also high, complicating the \nclassification process.  \nTo date , various methods have been proposed to address \nthese challenges, but the accuracy of classification is still not \nideal, [11]. In the field of AI -assisted diagnosis, convolutional \nneural networks (CNNs) and Transformer networks [12] are the \nmainstream feature extraction networks. CNN s traverse the \nfeature maps of images using convolutional kernels of different \nsizes to extract features from different positions of images. The \nCNN advantage lies in extracting local features of images, [13]. \nThe core module of the Transformer network is the multi-head \nself-attention module, which can capture global features of \nimages, based on global contextual information , [14, 15]. In \nrecent years , researchers have attempted to improve \nclassification accuracy through model fusion , [16]. However, \nexisting fusion methods mostly focus on fusing features \nextracted by different CNN networks [17], and do not \neffectively leverage both local and global features of the image. \nAdditionally, researchers often preprocess dermoscopy images \nbefore feature extraction to remove image artifacts and improve \ncontrast, [18]. To overcome the aforementioned problems, a \nnovel fusion model is  proposed here for  skin disease \nclassification. \nThe following are the main contributions of the paper: \n1) The incorporation of  an Efficient Channel Attention \n(ECA) module into the ConvNeXt network is proposed \nto enhance the network's focus on the lesion areas; \n2) During the feature extraction stage, the employment of \ntwo different networks ( ConvNeXt and Swin \nTransformer) is proposed  as two subnetworks train ed \nby means of transfer learning; \n3) The utilization of a Attentional Feature Fusion (AFF) \nmodule is proposed for feature fusion, allowing the \nmodel to dynamically allocate weights based on the \nimportance of input features. \nThe remaining structure of this paper is the following. \nSection 2 provides an overview of related work done in the \nfield of skin disease classification, including a brief summary of \nexisting models and their corresponding research outcomes. \nSection 3 presents a detailed description of the proposed model. \nSection 4 describes the experimental setup and results of the \nexperimental performance comparison of the proposed model  \nwith state-of-the-art models. Finally, Section 5 concludes the \npaper by summarizing the contributions of this study  and \nsetting up future directions for research.  \nII. RELATED WORK \nCNNs have been widely used for image feature extraction, \nleveraging different-sized convolutional kernels to capture local \nfeatures at different positions of the input image , [19]. With \nadvancements in neural network technology, CNN models , \nsuch as VGG [20], ResNet [21], DenseNet [22], EfficientNet \n[23], and ConvNeXt [24], have gained significant attention in \nimage classification. To focus more on the lesion areas, CNN \nmodels are often combined with attention mechanisms to \nimprove classification performance. For instance, Zhang et al. \n[25] designed an Attention Residual Learning (ARL) module \nthat combines residual learning and attention learning \nmechanisms to construct an Attention Residual Learning \nConvolutional Neural Network (ARL -CNN). The se authors  \nconducted experiments on the ISIC2017 dataset, demonstrating \nthat the ir model adapts to focusing on the skin lesion areas \nduring training. Wan et al. [26] proposed a Multi-Scale Long \nAttention Network (MSLANet) that fuses contextual \ninformation through three Long Attention Networks (LANets). \nAdditionally, MSLANet extracts multi -scale information \nthrough self-supervised learning. Their network achieved area \nunder the curve ( AUC) values of 93.7% and 92.4% on the \nISIC2017 and ISIC2020 datasets, respectively. However, CNN \nmodels are primarily adopted for extracting local features, \nmaking them less effective at capturing contextual information \nand long-range dependencies, thereby limiting their ability to \nextract global features effectively. \nIn recent years, Transformer networks, based on the multi -\nhead self -attention mechanism , have become popular for \nextracting global features by capturing global contextual \ninformation, [15]. Researchers have made various attempts to \nexplore the classification performance of Transformer networks \nin the field of skin disease classification. For instance, Ayas et \nal. [27] utilized the Swin Transformer model for skin disease \nclassification and introduced weighted cross -entropy loss to \naddress class imbalance. Their model achieved sensitivity and \nspecificity of 82.3% and 97.9%, respectively, on the ISIC2019 \ndataset. He et al. [14] designed a Fully Transformer Network \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

The se authors  introduced a Spatial Pyramid \nPooling (SPP) module in the multi -head attention (MHA) to \nreduce computational complexity and memory consumption. \nCai et al. [28] employed Vision Transformer (V IT) as the \nbackbone network for extracting deep image features and fused \nthe extracted features with patient metadata. The ir method \nachieved an accuracy of 93.81% on the ISIC2018 dataset. \nHowever, these Transformer -based models tend to capture \nglobal features while neglecting the consideration of local \nfeatures. \nTo effectively utilize different types of features, designing \nfeature fusion architectures is an effective approach that \nconsiders the feature extraction preferences of different \nnetworks to improve classification accuracy. In [29], Mahbod et \nal. proposed a Multi -Scale Multi-CNN Fusion (MSM -CNN) \nmethod for fusing features extracted by three CNN models on \nsix different scales of cropped images, achieving a balanced \nmulti-class accuracy of 86.2% on the ISIC2018 dataset. \nMaqsood et al. [17] presented a unified Computer-Aided \nDiagnosis (CAD) model for segmentation and classification of \nskin lesions. Their model fused features extracted by four pre-\ntrained CNN networks using a convolutional sparse image \ndecomposition fusion method and employed univariate \nmeasurement and Poisson distribution feature selection \nmethods to select the best classification features. The \nclassification accuracy of this method on the HAM10000, \nISIC2018, ISIC2019, and PH2 datasets was 98.57%, 98.62%, \n93.47%, and 98.98%, respectively. However, existing works \ntend to focus on designing feature fusion architectures based on \nCNN models, without effectively combining the local and \nglobal features of images. \nTherefore, combining the feature extraction advantages of \nboth CNNs and Transformers to effectively utilize the local and \nglobal features of images for skin disease classification is a \npromising research direction. \nIII. PROPOSED MODEL: ConvNeXt-ST-AFF \nIn contrast to the methods employed in [16], which fuse image \nfeatures extracted by VGG16, AlexNet, ResNet -18, and \nResNet-101, the presented research opts for the fusion of two \ndistinct types of feature extraction networks, namely CNNs and \nTransformers. This approach aims to effectively utilize both \nlocal and global image features for classification. Inspired by \nthe work presented in [13], we chose to merge the features \nextracted from each block of the ConvNeXt and Swin \nTransformer networks, rather than solely fusing the final \nfeatures. This strategy enables the Swin Transformer network to \ncontinually provide global feature information to the ConvNeXt \nnetwork. To address the limitations of fixed -weight fusion \nmethods like summation and concatenation, the proposed \nmodel employs an Attention Feature Fusion (AFF) module, \nallowing the network to dynamically adjust the weights of each \ninput feature during training. To further enhance the integration \nof local and global image features, a channel-shuffled operation \nis incorporated within the AFF module to improve information \ninteraction between different channel heights. Additionally, to \nmitigate class imbalance issues of the datasets utilized in the \nexperiments, data augmentation is applied to the images before \nnetwork training. Furthermore, denoising techniques are \nemployed to reduce image noise and enhance contrast in \ndermatoscopic images. Based on these considerations, the \nproposed ConvNeXt-ST-AFF model was elaborated with the \noverall structure illustrated in Figure 1.  \n \nInput\nStem\nConvNeXt block\nDims=dim\nConvNeXt block\nDims=dim*2\nConvNeXt block\nDims=dim*8\nConvNeXt block\nDims=dim*4\nDownsample\nDownsample\nDownsample\nLiner Embedding\nSwin transformer \nblock\nDims=dim\nSwin transformer \nblock\nDims=dim*2\nSwin transformer \nblock\nDims=dim*4\nSwin transformer \nblock\nDims=dim*8\nPatch Merging\nPatch Merging\nPatch Merging\nLayer Norm\nGlobal Average Pooling\nLiner\nPatch Partition\nDenoising \nmodule\nAFF\nAFF\nAFF\nAFF\nConvNeXt Swin \nTransformer\nClass\nHead\nFeature extraction module\n \nFIGURE 1.

This preprocessing step helps improve \nthe overall quality of the image s, making it easier for \nsubsequent modules to extract meaningful features. \n2) In the second step, each denoised image is fed into the \nfeature extraction module.

The Swin Transformer excels at \ncapturing global patterns and long-range dependencies \nin the image, while the ConvNeXt network focuses on \nextracting local features. By combining both global and \nlocal features, the proposed model gains a \ncomprehensive understanding of the skin disease \nimage. Additionally, AFF modules are utilized in this \nstep to fuse the features extracted by the Swin  \nTransformer and ConvNeXt networks effectively. \nThe AFF modules merge the local and global features, \nenabling the model to capture the synergistic \ninformation from both sources, leading to more \ndiscriminative feature representations. \n3) In t he final step, the fused features from the feature \nextraction module are fed into the classification head, \nwhere the final classification of the skin disease image \ntakes place. \nIn the following subsections, a detailed description of each \nmodule's functionality is separately provided. \nA. DENOISING MODULE \nThe presence of artifacts, such as body hair and blood vessels, \nin skin disease images  may have a negative impact on the \nmodel's classification performance [30]. Image denoising is an \neffective method for reducing artifacts in images , [31]. When \nusing traditional wavelet-based image denoising methods, it's \nnecessary to first determine the type of noise present in an \nimage, such as Gaussian noise or salt -and-pepper noise, and \nthen choose specific wavelets for denoising based on the noise \ntype. Additionally, parameter adjustments need to be made \nmanually for different types of images during the denoising \nprocess. \nIn recent years, neural network -based image denoising \nmethods have demonstrated excellent performance. The most \nsignificant difference between them and traditional methods lies \nin their generalization ability. Through extensive training on \nimage data, neural network methods automatically learn model \nparameters that adapt to different image data and noise \ndistributions during training, without relying on manual \nparameter tuning. This results in better generalization across \nvarious types of images and noise distributions, [32]. \nTherefore, in our study, we employed neural network-based \ndenoising methods. Specifically, we combined the design of \nRED-Net [33] to implement a smaller denoising network  that \nemploys an end-to-end training approach. It takes the original \nskin lesion image as input, trains the network to understand the \ndistribution of artifacts in skin lesion images, selectively \nreduces their impact, and ultimately outputs a denoised clean \nimage. As shown in Figure 2, the denoising module used in this \nstudy consists of an encoder, a decoder, and skip connections. \nThe encoder comprises five 2D convolutional blocks for feature \nextraction, while the decoder consists of five 2D transpose \nconvolutional blocks for recovering the denoised image. \nThe denoising module of the proposed model  employes \nsymmetric convolutional layers and transpose convolutional \nlayers to ensure consistency in the sizes of input and output \nimages. Specifically, convolutional layers serve as the encoder \nfor extracting image information. They are capable of learning \nthe essential information within the image and eliminating \nfeatures, including noise, that are irrelevant to network training. \nHowever, this process may result in the loss of certain image \ndetails. On the other hand, transpose convolutional layers \nprimarily focus on restoring fine details in the image. They \nupsample the low -resolution image output from the encoder, \nensuring that the recovered image maintains the same \nresolution as the original image. Inspired by U-Net and VGG-\nUNet [34], we have introduced skip connections between the \nsymmetric convolutional and transpose convolutional layers to \nbetter leverage shallow features containing more detailed \ninformation and deep features containing more semantic \ninformation for image recovery. Since the denoising module \nserves as a preprocessing step before image feature extraction, \nwe have intentionally avoided using any pooling operations \nwithin the denoising module. This is because pooling \noperations have the potential to discard valuable details from \nthe original image, resulting in the loss of critical information in \nthe recovered image. \nThe denoising module not only reduces the impact of \nartifacts in the image but also effectively enhances the contrast \nbetween lesion and non-lesion areas. \n2D Convolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n+\n2D Transposed \nConvolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n+\n+\nEncoder Decoder\nX Y\n2D Convolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n2D Convolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n2D Convolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n2D Convolution\nkernel_size=3)\n2D Transposed \nConvolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n2D Transposed \nConvolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n2D Transposed \nConvolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n2D Transposed \nConvolution\n(kernel_size=3)\n \nFIGURE 2. The denoising module structure.  \nB.  FEATURE EXTRACTION MODULE  \nThe feature extraction module of the proposed model utilizes \nConvNeXt and Swin Transformer as feature extraction \nnetworks. \nDue to the high cost of acquiring dermatological data, \ntraining a network from scratch solely using a dermatological \ndataset may result in insufficient training, leading to a lack of \ngeneralization ability. This problem can be addressed through \nthe application of transfer learning. \nTransfer learning is a machine learning method that \nleverages knowledge transferred from related learned tasks to a \nnew task, enabling a network to achieve higher performance \nwith limited training data , [3]. In the context of image \nclassification tasks, it is common to employ a network pre -\ntrained on a large-scale image dataset, such as ImageNet [35], \nand fine-tune it for the new task. \nMathematically, the operation of transfer learning is defined \nas per [17] as: \n𝑑𝑠 = {(𝑢1\n𝑠, 𝑣1\n𝑠), … , (𝑢𝑖\n𝑠, 𝑣𝑖\n𝑠), … , (𝑢𝑛\n𝑠 , 𝑣𝑛\n𝑠)} , (1) \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

They \nmerge low -level detail features with high -level semantic \nfeatures through summation or concatenation operations, \nenabling the network to obtain richer semantic representations, \n[36]. However, traditional summation- or concatenation-based \nfeature fusion methods can only assign fixed weights to \ndifferent features. \nTo enhance the feature fusion operation in skip connections, \nthe proposed model incorporates  Attentional Feature Fusion \n(AFF) modules [37]. The AFF module leverages the two input \nfeatures to generate dynamic fusion weights, allowing the \nnetwork to adaptively select features based on their importance.  \nThe specific implementation process of the Attention al \nFeature Fusion ( AFF) module , depicted in Figure 4 , is the \nfollowing. Firstly, the features 𝑋 and 𝑌 are combined through \nan initial feature fusion operation. The fused feature is then fed \ninto a Multi-Scale Channel Attention Module (MS -CAM) \nmodule, which generates a fusion weight 𝛼 (ranging from 0 to \n1), used as the weight for feature 𝑋, while 1 − 𝛼 is used as the \nweight for feature 𝑌 . This weighted fusion allows adaptive \nfeature fusion based on the importance of features 𝑋 and 𝑌. \nThrough the attention-based feature fusion process, the network \ncan dynamically adapt the weighted fusion of features 𝑋 and 𝑌, \nthereby enhancing the performance of the model. \nThe calculation process for the AFF module is defined in \n[37] as follows: \n𝑍 = 𝛼 ⊗ 𝑋 + (1 − 𝛼) ⊗ 𝑌 , (3) \nwhere 𝑍 ∈ 𝑅𝐶×𝐻×𝑊  denotes the fused feature , ⊗ denotes an \nelement-wise multiplication, and  𝛼 =  𝑀(𝑋 ⊎ 𝑌) denotes the \nfusion weight, where ⊎ denotes the initial feature fusion and 𝑀 \nrepresents the MS-CAM module, which plays a pivotal role in \naggregating local and global features. \nchannel_shuffle\nMS-CAM (1-a) Ä Xa Ä X\na 1-a\n+\nCat\nConv\nX Y\nZ\n \nFIGURE 4. The AFF structure. \n \nMS-CAM, shown in Figure 5,  utilizes point -wise \nconvolution with an 1x1 convolutional kernel to transform the \nchannel dimension of the feature map. This selection offers the \nadvantage of reducing the computational cost associated with \nusing different-scale convolutional kernels. Through the MS -\nCAM, the AFF module can effectively leverage information \nfrom different scales of the image and facilitate the effective \nfusion of local and global features.  \nThe MS -CAM module utilizes two branches to extract \nchannel attention weights. The first o ne employs Global \nAverage Pooling to extract global feature attention, while the \nsecond one directly uses Point-Wise Convolution (PWConv) to \nextract local feature attention. The local feature 𝐿(𝑋) ∈\n𝑅𝐶×𝐻×𝑊 is calculated as shown in [37]: \n𝐿(𝑋) = ℬ (𝑃𝑊𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣2 (𝛿(ℬ(𝑃𝑊𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣1(𝑋))))), (4) \nwhere the convolution kernels for 𝑃𝑊𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣1  and 𝑃𝑊𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣2 \nare of size 𝐶/𝑟 × 𝐶 × 1 × 1 and 𝐶 × 𝐶/𝑟 × 1 × 1, respectively. \nGiven the local feature L(X) and the global feature g(X), the \nweight 𝑎 in MS-CAM is calculated as follows: \n𝑎 = 𝑀(𝑋) = 𝜎(𝐿(𝑋) ⊕ 𝑔(𝑋)) , (5) \nwhere 𝑀(𝑋) ∈ 𝑅𝐶×𝐻×𝑊  denotes the attention weights \ngenerated by the MS-CAM module and  ⊕ denotes the element \nsummation. \n2) SWIN TRANSFORMER SUBMODULE \nThe Swin Transformer [38] is utilized as a global feature \nextraction submodule for image processing by the proposed \nmodel. Figure 6 illustrates the structure of two consecutive \nSwin Transformer blocks, each consisting of a Windows Multi-\nHead Self -Attention (W -MSA) or Shifted Windows Multi -\nHead Self -Attention (SW -MSA) subblock, a Multi-Layer \nPerceptron (MLP)  subblock (shown in Figure 7), two \nLayerNorm (LN) normalization layers, a DropPath layer, and \ntwo skip connections. W -MSA and SW -MSA subblocks are \napplied alternately in two consecutive Swin Transformer blocks. \nThe computation al flow for the two consecutive Swin \nTransformer blocks is defined in [38] as: \n𝑧ˆ𝑙 = 𝑊 − 𝑀𝑆𝐴 (𝐿𝑁(𝑧𝑙−1)) + 𝑧𝑙−1; (6) \n𝑧𝑙 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃 (𝐿𝑁(𝑧ˆ𝑙)) + 𝑧ˆ𝑙 ; (7) \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

The MLP structure. \n \nThe W-MSA subblock partitions the input feature map into \nmultiple non-overlapping windows and computes self-attention \nwithin each window. This design significantly reduces the \ncomputational complexity of the network. However, due to the \nwindow partitioning, the use of W-MSA can lead to \ninformation loss between windows. To address this issue, the \nSwin Transformer submodule employes a SW-MSA subblock. \nThe SW -MSA module incorporates an offset matrix 𝐵 ∈\n𝑅𝑀2×𝑀2\n when calculating self-attention as follows [38]: \n𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 (𝑄𝐾𝑇 /√𝑑 + 𝐵)𝑉, (10) \nwhere 𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉 ∈ 𝑅𝑀2×𝑑  denote the query, key, and value \nmatrices, respectively,  𝑑 denotes the dimension of the query \nand key, and 𝑀2 denotes the number of patches in a window. \nThe values in matrix 𝐵 are obtained from the offset matrix 𝐵ˆ ∈\n𝑅(2𝑀−1)×(2𝑀−1). \nThe SW-MSA subblock facilitates information propagation \nbetween windows. By combining the W -MSA and SW -MSA \nsubblocks, the Swin Transformer submodule is able to \nefficiently process large-scale images and effectively capture \nthe global features of the images. \n3) ConvNeXt SUBMODULE \nIn the feature extraction module of  the proposed model , a \nConvNeXt network [24] is used as a submodule for local \nfeature extraction from the skin disease images. The ConvNeXt \nnetwork consists of ConvNeXt blocks and Downsample blocks. \nAs illustrated in Figure 8a, each ConvNeXt block includes skip \nconnections, depthwise convolution layers, LN normalization \nlayers, MLP blocks, Layer Scale, and DropPath. The \ndownsample block structure is depicted in Figure 8c. \nECA\nDepthwise Conv2d\nK7，s1，p3\nLayer Norm\nMLP\nLayer Scale\nDepthwise Conv2d\nK7，s1，p3\nLayer Norm\nMLP\nLayer Scale\nDrop Path\n+\n（a） （b）\n+\nDrop Path\n Conv2d\nK2，s2\nLayer Norm\n（c）\n \nFIGURE 8.

For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n \n8 VOLUME XX, 2023 \nThe attention mechanism can enhance the network's focus on \nthe lesion regions during the training process, thereby \nimproving the model's performance, [39]. After comparing the \neffects of different attention modules, we ultimately chose to \nincorporate an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) subblock [40] \ninto the original ConvNeXt block as to enhance its feature \nextraction capability. The structure of the ConvNeXt block , \nmodified in this fashion, is illustrated in Figure 8b.  \nECA employes a type of channel attention mechanism that \ngenerates corresponding weight values for each channel in the \nfeature map based on their importance. This allows the network \nto pay more attention to important feature channels. The \nimplementation process follows these steps: when the feature \nmap is input ted into ECA, it first undergoes global average \npooling. Then, ECA adaptively computes the size of the one -\ndimensional convolution kernel and generates the weights for \neach channel in the feature map. Finally, the normalized \nweights are multiplied with the original feature map to produce \nthe channel -weighted feature map. The ECA structure is \ndepicted in Figure 9. \nGlobalAvgPooling\nConv1d\nSigmoid\nX*a\na\nX\n \nFIGURE 9. The ECA structure. \n4) FEATURE FUSION \nDifferent feature extraction networks have different preferences \nfor extracting features. Combining features extracted from \nmultiple networks can improve the adaptability of the fused \nfeatures and thus enhance classification performance. Therefore, \nin the proposed model , ConvNeXt and Swin Transformer \nnetworks are selected as two feature extraction networks. The \nSwin Transformer network can establish long -range \ndependencies, effectively extracting global features from the \nimage. On the other hand, the ConvNeXt network traverses the \nfeature map of the input image with convolutional kernels to \nextract local features. To fully leverage the advantages of these \nnetworks, the feature extraction module of the proposed model \nutilizes a AFF submodule, allowing it to dynamically generate \ncorresponding weights based on the importance of the input \nfeatures. The weighted features are then fused to make full use \nof both local and global features for skin disease classification. \nThe specific fusion process of the AFF module follows these \nsteps. Firstly, the features extracted by the Swin Transformer \nnetwork are linearly projected to the shape of 𝐵 × 𝐶 × 𝐻 × 𝑊. \nThey are then concatenated with the features extracted by the \nConvNeXt network. A 1x1 convolution is applied to transform \nthe channel-shuffled [41] feature map to the desired number of \nchannels. Finally, the fused feature map is input ted into MS-\nCAM to compute the weights. The weighted features are then \nseparately weighted and summed to obtain the fused feature. \nThrough the feature fusion of the AFF submodule, the \nproposed model can effectively utilize both local and global \nfeatures of the image s, thereby improving the classification \nperformance. \nC. DATA AUGMENTATION \nNeural networks require extensive training on annotated data to \nachieve high performance. However, acquiring skin disease \nimage data is costly, resulting in a relatively small number of \nimages in skin disease datasets, along with a severe class \nimbalance issue  [42]. This imbalance leads to lower \nclassification accuracy for classes with fewer images [43]. \nTherefore, before conducting model training, we employed data \naugmentation [44] to increase the diversity of image \ninformation in the utilized datasets. This helps mitigate the \nimpact of class imbalance on the model training results while \nenhancing the model's robustness and generalization \ncapabilities. The specific steps taken were the following: \n(1) The images in the training set were randomly cropped, \nand the cropped images were resized to 224 × 224 pixels. This \nstep helped in focusing on relevant regions of the images while \nmaintaining a consistent input size;  \n(2) The RandAugment method [45] was applied to enhance \nthe augmented images further. More specifically, in order to \nincrease the diversity of the training set, each image underwent \ntwo randomly selected image augmentation s out of fifteen \navailable options, such as  histogram equalization, contrast \nadjustment, color inversion, random rotation, increasing \nexposure, and random horizontal (vertical) translation , etc . \nUtilization of these data augmentation techniques  allowed to \nincreases the diversity of the images in the training set, \neffectively mitigating overfitting and enhancing the model's  \nclassification performance. Additionally, these techniques \ncontributed to achieving a more stable training process, [46]. \nExperimentally, a fter applying these data augmentation  \ntechniques, we found o ut that the ConvNeXt values of all \nevaluation metrics were indeed significantly higher than those \nof ConvNeXt without augmentation. Therefore, in the main \nexperiments, described in the next section, we chose to use the \nexperimental results of ConvNeXt after applying data \naugmentation as the baseline for comparison. \nIV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS  \nA. DATASETS \nIn the experiments, two datasets were used – a private dataset \ncontaining acne images and the publicly available ISIC2019 \ndataset. \nThe acne dataset was provided by Peking Union Medical \nCollege Hospital and used with the consent of all participants. \nThe dataset contains 2,900 skin lesion images classified into six \nclasses (Figure 10): acne (AC), melasma (ME), Ota nevus (ON), \nrosacea (ROS), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), and \nseborrheic dermatitis (SD).

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP \nIn the model training, a hyperparameter initialization was \nperformed, as follows: (i) in the experiments on the ISIC2019 \ndataset, the initial learning rate was set to 0.01 and the number \nof epochs was set to 100 ; (ii) in the experiments on the acne \ndataset, the initial learning rate was set to 0.0005  and the \nnumber of epochs was set to 60. In both sets of experiments, a \ncosine annealing strategy was employed to reduce the learning \nrate during model training, with a minimum learning rate of 1e-\n6. The batch size was set to 16. All models were optimized \nusing the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer [39], \nwith a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.0001. The \nloss function used was the cross-entropy loss function. \nThe experiments were conducted on a host machine running \nLinux 3.10.0-1062.el7.bclinux.x86_64 and equipped with an \nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6240 CPU @ 2.60GHz and an NVIDIA \nTesla V100S PCIe 32GB GPU.

EVALUATION METRICS \nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed model in \ncomparison to state -of-the-art models used  for skin lesion \nimage classification, multiple metrics were used to achieve  \ncomprehensive assessment of the model classification \nperformance.  \nA useful tool for visualizing the model classification \nperformance is the confusion matrix.

By comparing the training results, it can be \nobserved that the ConvNeXt model performs the best among \nthe four CNNs, according to all evaluation metrics, except for \nrecall on the  ISIC2019 dataset. The Swin Transformer \ndemonstrates the best classification performance among the two \nTransformer networks on both datasets, according to all \nevaluation metrics.  \n \nTABLE 3.

ABLATION STUDY \nTables 5 and 6 present the results of each step of the ablation \nstudy performed with the proposed model on the ISIC2019 and \nacne datasets, respectively. In the first step, by adding the \ndenoising module to ConvNeXt, the values of all metrics were \nimproved, compared to those of ConvNeXt, except for \nprecision on the acne dataset. In the second step , by \nincorporating the ECA attention module alone into ConvNeXt, \nthe values of all metrics were improved, compared to those of \nConvNeXt, except for precision on the ISIC2019 dataset and \nfor recall, specificity, and F1-score on the acne dataset. In the \nthird step , by directly fusing the features extracted by \nConvNeXt and Swin Transformer, the values of all metrics \nwere improved, compared to those separately achieved by \nConvNeXt and Swin Transformer, except for precision w.r.t. \nConvNeXt on the ISIC2019 dataset. In the fourth step, by \nadding AFF modules to the combined scheme of ConvNeXt \nand Swin Transformer, further improvement was achieved on \nall metrics, compared to the previous step, except for recall, \nspecificity, and F1-score on the acne dataset. Finally, in the last \nstep, when using all modules, resulting the proposed \nConvNeXt-ST-AFF model, top values of all metrics were \nachieved, except for precision on the ISIC2019 dataset. \nTable 7 displays the classification accuracy of the proposed \nConvNeXt-ST-AFF model under different hyperparameter \nsettings.

DISCUSSION \nTable 10 shows performance comparison of  the proposed \nmodel with state-of-the-art-models, based on their respective \nresults reported in the corresponding literature sources ( \"-\" in \nthe table indicates missing data in a source) . The proposed \nmodel clearly outperforms all other models, according to all \nevaluation metrics used, except for accuracy where the leader is \nthe model  described in [17]. Furthermore, compared to the \nlightweight models in [50] and [51], although the proposed \nmodel has a larger number of parameters, it has shown \nsignificant improvements in classification performance. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn the presented study, we have effectively mitigated the impact \nof class imbalance on classification performance by employing \ndata augmentation. We also introduced an image denoising \nmodule for eliminating the artifacts, such as hair in \ndermoscopic images , and for enhancing the contrast. \nFurthermore, we proposed a model fusion approach with \nadaptive weights whose effectiveness has been validated. \n  \nTABLE 10.

Moreover, the \ncomparison of  its results  on the ISIC2019 dataset  to those \nreported in the literature for state -of-the-art c lassification \nmodels clearly has demonstrated that the proposed model \noutperforms them, according to all evaluation metrics used, \nexcept for one of the models according to accuracy only. \nThe main limitation of this study lies in the increased \ncomputational burden resulting from the model fusion approach. \nIn the future, we plan to optimize the network architecture of \nthe proposed model  by incorporating the latest lightweight \nmodel design techniques , such as MobileViT  [56] and \nFasterNet [57], in order to reduce computational demands. \nAdditionally, we aim to further refine the denoising module to \nimprove its effectiveness in eliminating image artifacts and \nreducing the influence of irrelevant features on model training. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M.
