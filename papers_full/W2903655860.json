The variabil-\nity in the use of macro-tools in the past led to in-depth study of this category of artefacts,\nwhich has been analyzed from both a technological [2–6] and functional point of view,\nthrough the observation of macro and micro-traces [7–23]. There have also been important\nstudies of the mechanical [24–26] and physical properties of the rocks [27], applying UBM\nlaser profilometry methods [28], and of the residues [29–38]. Furthermore, the principles of\ntribology have made a great contribution to the study of macro-lithic tools for understanding\nthe various processes that lead to use wear development [39–48].\nSo far, most of the functional data regarding macro-lithics comes from later prehistoric\ncontexts–e.g. the Neolithic and Chalcolithic–while little information is available on the early\nuse of such tools during the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic. Recent studies carried out on the tools\nfound in the Bilancino site [49–52] and Grotta Paglicci [53], both in Italy, have emphasized the\nrelationship between these tools and technological aspects such as plant food processing dur-\ning the Upper Palaeolithic. Skills involved in the processing of different raw materials, such as\nplants [54–59] and minerals [60–64] have little visibility in the archaeological record. It is clear\nthat it is necessary to intensify the functional studies on this category of artefacts, especially\nwith regards to hunter-gatherer societies. The techno-cultural choices of these groups, for\nexample in relation to a general evolution of human cognition and social interaction, could\nhave been much more complex [65]. These choices encouraged the creation or the adoption of\ninnovative technologies combined with a series of collateral activities, such as the ability to col-\nlect raw materials, transport strategies, the complementary use of tools to produce other tools,\nor to process organic and inorganic raw materials [66].\nTools used in percussion activities, such as spheroids and anvils, are evident since the earlier\nphases of the Palaeolithic [67–70], being made out of different raw materials and used to pro-\ncess different substances.\nMacro-lithic tools are also related to the production of knapped stone tools. Indeed, ham-\nmerstones and retouchers made of stone [4,21,71–73] and bone [74,75], are found in numer-\nous contexts, especially related to the later phases of the Palaeolithic [4]. As an example, bone\nretouchers have been found in different Middle and Late Pleistocene sites [76,77,78–85, 86].\nRarer are the antler billets [87–89] or wood retouchers [90].\nTo date, functional studies on this tool category are still lacking. Indeed, the use and the\ntype of hammerstone or retoucher (e.g. hard or soft) is determined, or hypothesized, indirectly\nthrough the scrutiny of some morpho-metric features observed on the produced blanks (e.g.\nfeatures of the impact point and the bulb, the internal and external platform angle, the dimen-\nsions of the striking platform and the morphology of the detachment scars or ridges of the dor-\nsal face) or the retouched edge (e.g. features of scars and the bulb, the inclination of the\nretouch scars with respect to the opposed face, and the morphology of the scars). The identifi-\ncation of knapping techniques has usually been carried out in combination with experimental\nactivities and numerous contributions have been published over the years [91–98], while more\ngeneric information is available for the use of hammers on bones [99].\nEven though this type of analysis provides interesting information, some limitations do\nexist. Firstly, the analysis of these features focuses mainly on the knapping techniques. Sec-\nondly, it is an indirect analysis, which is exclusively based on diagnostic features on the “prod-\nuct”, even in those cases where the presence of hammerstones and retouchers or of ones\npotentially in the archaeological record would allow a detailed study of the percussion and\nretouching techniques. In this respect we often read about the presence of “fluvial pebbles”,\nwhich were probably used at the site as hammers, but have not been analysed by means of use\nwear analysis [100].\nAn integrated method for understanding the function of macro-li thic tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02077 73 December 12, 2018 2 / 46\nIn this paper we present a multidisciplinary analysis of the repertoire of pebbles associated\nwith the Protoaurignacian and Aurignacian levels of Fumane Cave. Such tools represent a\nvaluable opportunity to detail the gestures of Early Upper Palaeolithic percussion activities,\nand the criteria involved in raw material selection and macro-lithic tool exploitation at the site.\nThe combination of experimental archaeology, use wear analysis and GIS analysis allows fur-\nther enhancement of the results provided by functional analysis, through the addition of quan-\ntitative data, and its potential has been already proved by the pioneering studies performed by\nDe la Torre and colleagues [101], Caruana and colleagues [102] and more recently by Benito-\nCalvo and colleagues [103–105].\nOur results further confirm the reliability of this combined methodology and provide new\nand relevant insights regarding the variety of percussion activities performed during the early\nUpper Palaeolithic occupation of Fumane Cave.\nThe archaeological context: The Protoaurignacian and Aurignacian at\nFumane Cave\nFumane Cave is located in the Venetian Prealps (north-eastern Italy) (Fig 1). The cave has\nbeen under excavation since 1988 and is characterized by a high-resolution stratigraphic\nFig 1.

Today, it represents a key site for understanding the com-\nplex processes that led to the demise of Neanderthal populations and the spread of modern\nhumans across Europe [113]. Layers A2 and A1 date the appearance of the Protoaurignacian\nto 41.2–40.4 ky cal BP, while a combustion feature embedded in the stratigraphic complex D3\nFig 2.

A recent assessment of the\nProtoaurignacian [111,115] and Aurignacian [116] lithic technologies, has permitted an accu-\nrate narrative of the diachronic changes that occur throughout the stratigraphic sequence and\nenables us to critically address the techno-typological signature of the Aurignacian in northern\nItaly. Overall, bladelets were the first goal of the lithic production in all the studied assem-\nblages. They were obtained from a broad range of independent reduction strategies, among\nwhich carinated technology seems to increase towards the top of the sequence. The rather stan-\ndardized reduction procedures, reconstructed from the study of blanks and initial and\nexhausted cores, were tailored for the production of regular and frequently pointed bladelets\nby means of unidirectional convergent knapping progressions. Blades represented the second\ngoal of the lithic production system and their frequency remains stable throughout the\nsequence. Blades were obtained from sub-prismatic cores using direct marginal percussion on\nflat striking platforms and were also produced during several maintenance operations carried\nout on bladelet cores. Unlike blades, flake production increases in the Aurignacian assem-\nblages, where it also appears to be more standardized [117]. Tool assemblages are dominated\nby retouched bladelets, with frequencies that progressively decrease from layer A2 (around\n80%) to the top of layer D3 (around 50%). Modification is in most cases marginal, semi-steep,\nand was conducted to shape bladelets with convergent retouch and bladelets with lateral\nretouch [118]. In both cases retouch delineation is regular and generally follows the initial\nmorphology of the blank. Among common tools, laterally retouched blades and burins are\nmore prevalent in the Protoaurignacian layers, while endscrapers significantly increase in the\nAurignacian assemblages. Laterally retouched blades present unilateral or bilateral retouches.\nModification is in most cases direct and, especially on the thicker blanks, has a scaled mor-\nphology. The so-called Aurignacian retouch [119] is instead rare. Endscrapers, both on blade\nand flake, display in most cases a thin working edge shaped by short lamellar removals. Some\nof them were made on retouched blanks. The working edge was frequently reshaped, and sev-\neral wear traces were identified. Finally, thick endscrapers, such as carinated and nosed forms,\nwere in most cases used as cores for the extraction of small and curved bladelets.\nMaterials and methods\nThe archaeological sample\nThe archaeological sample coming from the Protoaurignacian and the Aurignacian levels of\nFumane Cave, is composed of 7 specimens, that characterize the entire assemblage (General\nTable 1.

These are naturally rounded pebbles originated in a flu-\nvial sedimentary context. As suggested by previous studies [120] pebbles with a high degree of\nrounding have been collected, more likely, from fluvial deposits originating from high-energy\nwater courses, like the Adige river which currently flows 20km south of Fumane. Indeed, they\ndo not present any technological modification, their morphologies are rather recurrent, circu-\nlar or oval with oval section. The overall dimensions are small, the average length equals to 68\nmm, with an average width of 56 mm and an average weight of 322 gr.\nPebbles are made of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks: a) compact limestone, with fine\ntexture (n 4); b) soft limestone, with a characteristic pink and white colour (n 2); c) ophicalcite,\na metamorphic rock with carbonate cement veins of allochthonous origin (n 1) (Determina-\ntion by Stefano Bertola).\nHowever, as stressed by Bertola and colleagues [120] in the case of sedimentary rocks, the\nlithologies are various, attributable to different horizons included in the carbonatic formations\ncropping in the area, from Upper Cretacic Scaglia Rossa to Jurassic “Calcari Grigi”\nWithin the archaeological sample, 6 artefacts are intact or with perfectly reassembling\nparts, while 1 sample are fragmentary, along with one specimen characterised by fractures\ncaused by a probable source of heat that caused it to expand (Table 1).

The functional approach is based on the analysis\nof different aspects related to the use of macro-lithic tools.\nFor the study, the specimens were observed utilizing a Zeiss Axio Zoom V16 binocular ste-\nreo microscope, oculars PI 10x/23, objective 1x/0.25 FWD 56mm, with progressive magnifica-\ntions ranging between 10x and 80x. This low-magnification observation allowed us to propose\na hypothesis regarding the gestures and details related to the kinetics of the object. Further-\nmore, it allowed us to determine the nature and status of the processed matter with which the\nobject came into contact. Topography and microtopography, grain shapes, pits, striation and\nfracture morphologies on experimental and archaeological artefacts have been described\naccording to parameters already described in literature [3,20]. 3D models of the surface were\nproduced utilizing Mountain Map Premium 7.2, which provided more information related to\nthe evolution of the microtopography and details concerning the morphology of the identified\ntraces.\nA second level of observation consisted of the analysis of the specimens at higher magnifica-\ntion (50-500x) using Zeiss Scope A.1 metallographic microscope equipped with 10x oculars\nand with objectives ranging from 5x to 50x. This allowed the investigation of micro wear (e.g.\nmicro-striations and micro-polishes) to achieve more information about the use of the tools.\nPolishes have been described by taking into account their texture, topography, distribution,\nextension and linkage (for more details see [23,121,122]). The surfaces have been documented\nusing a Zeiss Axiocam 305/506 color camera and were washed with neutro phosphate deter-\ngent (Derquim) and ultrasonic cleaner AU-32 (ARGO LAB) for 15/20m.\nPhotogrammetry\n3D Models of both experimental and archaeological samples have been created through the\napplication of photogrammetry. Following the protocol developed by Porter and colleagues\n[123] 3D models of the artefact were built using Agisoft Photoscan 1.3.4.\nThe tools were placed on an automatic turntable in order to produce 360˚ sets of each of\nthe tool’s surfaces. Pictures of the tools were shot using a Nikon D7200 DSLR camera equipped\nwith a Nikkor 105 Macro Lense. Each picture was taken every 15˚, and at every full revolution\nthe camera was lifted and slightly titled towards the target for a total of 72 picture per object\nside. A total of 144 pictures were taken per object, which were subsequently imported in Agi-\nsoft Photoscan Pro 1.3.4 to produce high quality dense point clouds and meshes.\nSurface morphometric analysis\nGIS analysis has been adopted to analyse the morphometric characteristics of both experimen-\ntal and archaeological samples. Applying both the methodologies proposed by Caruana et al\n[102], Benito-Calvo et al [103] and de la Torre et al [101] it has been possible to analyse and\nquantify use wear patterns originated from both retouching and percussive activities. After the\ncreation of 3D Models, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) featuring a resolution of 0.5mm were\ncreated in Agisoft Photoscan 1.3.4 and imported as raster files in ArcGIS 10.5.\nDigital Surface Models were generated in order to analyse the topographic features charac-\nterising the tool’s surface. At first a Hillshade model of the entire surface was created. This\nallowed a first morphometric assessment of the surface topography that permitted the identifi-\ncation of the Functional Area/s (FA) of the surface which are affected by use.\nAn integrated method for understanding the function of macro-li thic tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02077 73 December 12, 2018 7 / 46\nTable 2.

Subsequently, two DSMs devoted to the analysis of sur-\nface roughness were generated. Analysing surface roughness permits the analysis of the degree\nof homogeneity or heterogeneity characterising the tool’s surface. As already stated by Benito-\nCalvo and colleagues (2015) the measurement of surface roughness can lead to the identifica-\ntion of polished areas (low roughness) generated by use. Two methods of surface roughness\nmeasurement have been applied: Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) and Vector Ruggedness Mea-\nsure (VRM). TRI is based on the algorithm proposed by Riley and colleagues [124] and calcu-\nlates the sum change in elevation between a grid cell and its neighbourhood. In the resulting\nDSM, a TRI value of 0 represents the minimum degree of roughness (i.e. homogeneous sur-\nface). Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM) measures roughness as the dispersion of vectors\northogonal to the surface within a specific neighbourhood. This method captures variability in\nslope and aspect into a single measure. A value of 0 represents no terrain variation (or lowest\nroughness) while a value of 1 represents a complete terrain variation (maximum roughness).\nIn the case of the experimental replicas, 3D models and resulting DSMs were made before and\nafter use. This allowed the mapping and quantification of the degree of variation in surface\ntopography related to each of the experimental activities performed.\nFollowing the methodological framework proposed by Caruana et al [102] the FAs of both\nexperimental and archaeological implements were analysed through Topographic Position Index\nin order to identify areas of high micro topographic roughness coinciding with use related damage.\nTopographic Position Index (TPI) is an elevation residual analysis which is applied to iden-\ntify depressions and ridges affecting the artefacts surface topography [103]. The DSM gener-\nated is based on the computation of the difference between the elevation of a cell and the mean\nelevation in a neighbourhood surrounding that cell. Neighbourhood mean elevation is calcu-\nlated using a moving window centred on the cell of interest. TPI positive values indicate that\nthe cell is higher than its neighbourhood while negative values indicate the cell is lower, corre-\nsponding to either ridges and depressions. Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord GI\n�\n) was performed\non the generated surface in order to identify clusters of pits and ridges highlighted by TPI and\ncorresponding to wear caused by use. The patterns identified through Hot Spot Analysis\nTable 2.

Raw materials were collected\naccording to the size and morpho-metric features of the archaeological specimens. Small and\nrounded pebbles (mean length 50 mm) of compact limestone were gathered along the Adige\nriver bank, about 20 km away from Fumane. Coarse limestone pebbles were collected in a\nstream bed close to the site. The latter showed a pink/white colour, probably due to geochemi-\ncal alterations related to the particular depositional environment.\nThe collected items (5 retouchers, 3 retouchers/hammerston es, 9 hammerstones, 2 anvil)\nwere used in several experimental tests) and their surface was documented using both the ste-\nreo and metallographic microscopes before and after their use, in order to observe the modifi-\ncations caused by use.\nAfter a preliminary observation of the archaeological sample, it became clear that the\nFumane macro-lithics had been used in various activities related to the processing of stone and\nmaterials of a non-organic nature. The experimental framework involved 19 pebbles used as\nhammers in various stages of bladelet production and retouchers, according to the technical\nsolutions known from the analysis performed on the lithic artefacts from the Protoaurignacian\nand Aurignacian levels of the site, in which core reduction and maintenance are illustrated\nalong with the morpho-technical features of the laminar products and the typology of the\nretouched tools [110,111,115,120].\nFor our experimental purposes, nodules of fine-grained flints were used. Several tests have\nbeen performed by the flint-knapper, following a precise strategy: a single hammer has been\nused to perform a specific action with the aim of isolating the functional traces, while others\nhave been involved in different technical gestures to produce experimental replicas showing\nmulti-functional surfaces (a complete list of uses has been illustrated in Table 2).\nGestures have been described following the criteria outlined by Bourguignon [78]. The fol-\nlowing points aim to explain the different phases and the relative technical gestures performed\nby the expert knapper during the experimental activities:\nFig 4. Experimenta l retouchin g.

The soft stone hammers (103x55mm, average dimensions)\nwere used for opening of the nodules to remove cortical flakes in order to shape a pre-form\ncore composed of a single flaking surface related to a single striking platform. During this\nstep, the hammer’s marginal ends have been used as active parts, performing a punctual ges-\nture consisting of a wide rectilinear trajectory of the arm, related to the force necessary to\nremove larger products. Despite their effectiveness in flake detachment (cortical and non-\ncortical), they broke after a reduced number of blows (conchoidal fracture along the func-\ntional end or straight fracture following the percussion axis). Therefore, their use during this\nstage was evaluated as not functional;\n• flaking surface and striking platform configuration. After having designed the core volume,\nthe soft hammers (50x50mm, average dimensions) were used to open a flaking surface and\nprepare the platform and the flaking angle through tiny flake removal. During this phase,\nflakes of various sizes were removed alternating with abrasion of the overhang performed\nwith the same hammer. This latter action required consequential and rapid gestures with\nresting percussion, aimed to remove micro-flakes from the overhang. This resulted in a\nmore continuous action that involved a wide contact area–usually along the flat axis or\nFig 7. FSPM-13 use wear on experimen tal replica used in overhang abrasion.

Removals of larger\nmaintenance flakes required slower and more precise blows with a curvilinear trajectory,\nvariable amplitude and force related to the size of the desired flake to be removed. This\naction involved the use of the marginal ends of the pebble along the minor axis;\n• blank production and core maintenance. After having shaped the core, we proceeded to the\nextraction of lamellar blanks using an organic hammer (deer antler; [120], p.133) and a soft\nstone hammer, as hypothesized in a recent revision of the bladelets’ technical attributes\n([111] p.27). During this phase, the stone hammers (sized 50-40mm in length, average\ndimensions) were always used with a rectilinear trajectory on their marginal ends. They per-\nformed effectively in blade production, even though small conchoidal fractures appeared in\nthe functional area which, however, did not lead to discarding the tool. Flake detachment\nand abrasion operations were also carried out, aimed at maintaining the flaking angle and\nthe transverse and longitudinal convexities of the core;\n• bipolar percussion. Due to the presence of some splintered pieces in the archaeological\nassemblage ([120], p.139) we tested the bipolar percussion by placing the core on a base,\nFig 8.

At this stage, the core was\nof very reduced size and allowed the application of this technique despite the small size of\nthe anvil (50x50x30 mm, average dimensions);\n• retouching. Several gestures have been tested according to the different morphologies and\nintensity of retouching documented for Protoaurignacian and Aurignacian levels at Fumane\ncave. The occurrence of retouch features was strictly combined with the gesture and the tech-\nnique, which involved different uses of the functional areas of the pebbles (e.g. short edge or\nflat face).\na. Direct percussion. A rapid and consequential gesture was performed: the knapper’s arm\nmoved following an oblique dragging trajectory against the blank’s edge, striking it very\nquickly using the tool’s flat face along the apical area. This movement allowed the\nremoval of tiny flakes and was particularly effective for delineating straight cutting edges\nwith marginal and abrupt retouch on thinner edges, due to the limited contact area\nbetween the hammer and the blank edge of a wide spectrum of blank morphologies from\nsimple flakes to blades sharing a consistent thickness (Figs 4A and 5B). We noted that\nthis type of retouch can also be performed with different trajectories (e.g. perpendicular\nFig 9. FA-8 use wear on experime ntal replica used in passive percussion. (a) Macro-tra ces (40x) consisted of large pits with sub-quadrang ular/tria ngular morpholo gy,\ngrains appeared fractured, located in the central area of the flat surface of the pebble; (b) the micro-trac es (200x) are absent, the bottom of the pits appear rough; (c) 3D\nmicrotop ography of the unused surface and profile; (d) 3D microtopogr aphy of the used surface and profile.\nhttps://do i.org/10.1371/j ournal.pone .0207773.g00 9\nAn integrated method for understanding the function of macro-li thic tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02077 73 December 12, 2018 14 / 46\nto the blank axis). This technique was also used to delineate the front of carinated end-\nscrapers and of some thin scrapers, even though the short edge of the retoucher was\nused. This allowed the removal of tiny bladelets and elongated flakes by adopting a mar-\nginal percussion (cfr. [125]). A more punctual gesture produced a more invasive retouch\nof a scaled type (Figs 4B and 5A), due to a larger contact area between the hammer flat\nface and the blank to be retouched. This action followed a perpendicular trajectory, with\nrespect to the blank edge, with a movement from the top to the bottom of the arm and a\nfinal flexion downwards. This type of retouch has been performed on blades for delineat-\ning the front of the end-scrapers (cfr. [111,120]).\nb. Direct percussion on anvil (Fig 6). This technique was aimed at retouching tiny blade-\nlets: a flat pebble was used as anvil on which the blank edge was modified through the\nuse of a retoucher by percussion ([98,126,127]). The trajectory was found to be variable\ndepending on the position of the blank to be retouched on the anvil: in a central position\na perpendicular trajectory was adopted, while when slightly inclined in proximity of the\nlateral edge of the anvil an oblique trajectory was adopted. In both cases, the short edges\nof the retoucher were used.\nFig 10. FRS-1 use wear on experimen tal replica used in scaled retouch .

The mechanical levelling led to the\nproduction of short strips and sporadic polishing with loose-separated distribution on the\ntop of the grains, with deep striation with the same orientation, and a rough texture and\ndomed topography. The traces were located on the short edge of the hammerstone.\nPits produced by the trimming of the striking platform and the production of blanks and core\nmaintenance looked very similar in their distribution and morphology. Often overlapping, pits were\nnot well defined, but polishes looked different. In particular, the trimming of the striking platform\nproduced polishing as a consequence of repeated contact between the hammer and the edge of the\nflint tool. On the contrary, the detachment of the blades/bladelets consisted of a more precise blow.\nBipolar percussion\nBipolar percussion makes large pits with sub-quadrangula r/triangular morphology located in\nthe central area of the flat surface of the tool. The texture grains appear fractured, polishes are\nabsent (Fig 9).\nFig 15. Experime ntal objects utilized for scaled retouch (I) and marginal retouch (II).

In detail, the scaled retouch generated a\nseries of contiguous pits of a linear form (reduced half-moon) with a rough bottom and an\nasymmetric triangular section, localised on the flat surfaces of the tool concentrated near the\napices. There were also striations: short, more sporadic and superficial (Fig 10). The micro-\npolishes were probably absent because the traces resulted from a punctual contact between the\nretoucher and the edge of the flint tool (the dragged gesture is absent).\nMarginal retouch led to an association of small circular pits and dense long parallel stria-\ntions. Use-wear traces concentrated over the apical area of the flat surface, with oblique orien-\ntations. Bands of polishing with striations were present, with covered-closed distribution, a\nrough texture and domed topography. The dragging movement (oblique trajectory) related to\nthe marginal retouch, produced a mechanical levelling of the surface where the polishes were\npresent (Fig 11).\nOther types of retouching were tested, including edge abrasion. This activity produced\ntraces located in a small area between the short edge and the apical area of the retoucher. The\ntraces consisted of small pits with sub-quadrangular morphology and short striations. The\nrough polishes were present.\nRetouching on an anvil produced, on the passive base, superficial small pits with a sub-cir-\ncular morphology and short striation. The use wear was located on the flat surface. The pol-\nishes were absent. The same traces were present on the active retoucher but located on the\nshort edge (Fig 12).\nTable 3.

Macro-\nscopically, the prehensive area was smoothed, with several patches of smooth/flat polishing,\naffecting the top of the grains. Polishes visible between 20x and 50x developed on the flat and\ncentral portion of the tool, favoured by a type of prehension in which a large portion of the fin-\nger (fingertip) was in contact with the flat surface of the tool. Polishing was not observed in\ncases where the hammer or the retoucher was gripped by the short margins (tridigital prehen-\nsions) and the contact occurred with a reduced portion of the finger (Fig 13).\nGIS analysis—Experimental sample\nOverall, the raw material characterising the experimental sample presented in this work was\nhomogeneous. This led to minimal modifications of the tools surfaces in particular concerning\ntheir roughness. On the other hand, the analysis of slope revealed several differences between\nthe activities performed (Fig 14).\nThe experimental replicas utilised to produce scaled retouch recorded the development of\ndepressions exhibiting a mean slope value of 9.94˚. Surface ruggedness measured through TRI\nand VRM appeared low with a mean TRI value of (0.0015) and a VRM mean value of (0.001).\nFig 16.

Scaled retouch (Fig 15I,\nTable 3) led to the development of use-related wear on the apical portion of the tool. Wear fea-\ntures were characterised by an average perimeter and an area of 8.6 mm and 1.5 mm\n2\nrespec-\ntively. The average distance of the wear feature from the centre of the tool was 16 mm while\nthe average from its edge was 13 mm. Traces are concentrated over the central portion of the\ntool apex as suggested by the standard deviational ellipse elongation value (0.87 ad). As in the\ncase of scaled retouch, use wear generated by marginal retouch (Fig 15II, Table 3) also affected\nthe apical portion of the retoucher. The depression caused by use featured a slope mean value\nof 18.8˚. The surface showed an overall homogeneity as indicated by the recorded TRI\n(0.0015) and VRM (0.0023) mean values, with most of the surface variability localised on the\ntool apical areas.

Traces generated by marginal retouch were well spread over the retoucher apical\nportion as suggested by the standard deviational ellipse elongation value (1.7 ad), higher than\nthe value observed on the experimental replica used in scaled retouching.\nPassive percussion (Fig 16I, Table 3) led to the development of wear over the central area\nof the tool used as anvil, where depressions developed featuring a mean slope value of 11.2˚.\nThe surface was overall homogeneous (TRI mean value 0.007) with a low topographic variabil-\nity (VRM mean value 0,0009) mostly at the bottom of the produced wear. Use marks generated\nby passive percussion featured a mean perimeter of 7.2 mm and an average area of 1 mm\n2\n.\nTraces were localised near the centre of the tool, with an average distance from the centre of 9\nmm, while their average distance from the edges averaged 21mm. Traces were concentrated\non the tool surface centre as indicated by the standard deviational ellipse elongation value of\n0.7 ad.\nAdjustment of core ridges (Fig 16II, Table 3) led to the development of use wear over the\napical portion of the tool and in a minimal part over its inner areas. Depressions caused by use\nfeatured a mean slope value of 14˚, while the TRI and VRM mean values, 0.0011 and 0.0034\nrespectively, suggest an overall homogeneous surface topography with its higher topographic\nvariability localised over the outer portion of the tool apical area. Marks generated by use were\nrelatively large given their average perimeter of 14 mm and mean area of 3 mm\n2\n.

Use related damage was well spread over the affected area of the tool\nas indicated by the standard deviational ellipse elongation value of 1.2 ad.\nFor the purpose of bladelets production (Fig 17, Table 3), the short edge of the experimen-\ntal replicas was used rather than its surface. Over the used portion the depressions generated\nby use were characterised by an average slope value of 23.7˚. The used area of the tool was\ncharacterised by a higher degree of heterogeneity when compared to the other experimental\nsamples presented in this work, as indicated by TRI (mean value 0,0025) and VRM (mean\nvalue 0,0067). Of particular interest is the fact that surface roughness was lower in proximity to\nthe centre of the used surface area, where the bigger traces were located. Wear generated by\nbladelets production featured an average perimeter of 3.8 mm and a mean area of 1 mm\n2\n.\nDamage affected most of the used area of the tool as indicated by the standard deviational\nellipse elongation value (2.3ad) (Fig 18, Table 3).\nArchaeological sample\nUse wear analysis. In the archaeological sample, traces of use were identified on 7 objects.\nThese allowed the determination of the use of the tools at Fumane cave as: a) hammerstones\nFig 19.

The artefacts showed a general rounding due to\npost-depositional alteration, probably of chemical nature. Invasive patinas or concretions were\nvisible in one case (RF73 around the edge) (Table 4).\nHammerstones. In four cases (RF127, RF73, RF138, RF37) pits and flake scars were local-\nized on the short edges of the tool, namely on the opposing short margins or, if the instrument\npresents a sub-circular shape, all around its perimeter. Small pits overlapped, often associated\nwith short and chaotic striations (RF127) (Fig 19). Polishing was not present, probably due to\nthe overall rounding of the surface caused by post-depositional alterations. For the same rea-\nson, the pits morphologies were not well defined. However, they shared characteristics similar\nto those observed on wear produced during core maintenance, related to the detachment of\nsmall flakes observed during the experimental knapping of bladelets. One hammerstone\n(RF138) was characterised by pits associated with negative flake scars (average dimensions\n25mm) localised on the short edge of the tool. Deep, long striations were localised on the flat\nsurface, or on the long edge (RF73 and RF37). The flake scars looked very similar to the experi-\nmental ones produced during bladelet removal and in overhang abrasions during core man-\nagement. In one case (RF73) there was an association between the pits, in the marginal\nextremities, and long and deep striations on the flat surface (Fig 20). Moreover, on RF127\nFig 20.

These latter patches of polish, affecting the top of the grains were characterised\nby a flat topography and a smooth texture similar to that observed on the experimental sample\nand related to prehension (Fig 21).\nAnvil. Artefact RF92 featured pits with sub-triangular morphology over its central area.\nThese had a rough bottom with microcracks visible over the grains. Polishing was not present.\nThe observed functional patterns were similar to the experimental sample used as a passive\nanvil for flake detachment (Fig 22).\nRetouchers. Macro-traces observed at the stereo-microscope were represented by pits\nand striations. However, the pits displayed differences in morphology and location. In two\ncases (RF67 and RF127) the pits were located on the apices opposite to the flat surfaces (on one\nor both surfaces). The morphology of the pits was linear (reduced half-moon), with a triangu-\nlar section. Polishing was not present (Figs 23 and 24).\nIn two other cases (RF80 and RF92) (Fig 25) pits were always located on the flat surfaces of\nthe tool over the apices and were characterized by circular morphology, associated with the\npresence of long, parallel, superficial and overlapped striations. These traces were very similar\nto ones observed in the experimental replica used for marginal retouching.\nFig 21.

Wear generated by use featured a mean perimeter of 9 mm and\nmean area of 1 mm\n2\n. As observed on the experimental replica, use related traces were located\ntowards the artefact edge (mean distance 12mm), while their average distance from the tools\ncentre was 20mm. Wear results were well dispersed over the apical area of the retoucher as\nindicated by the standard deviational ellipse elongation value (1.6 ad).\nUse wear identified on artefact RF80 (Fig 26II, Table 5) allowed us to interpret its function\nas a retoucher utilised for marginal retouching. As in the case of artefact RF67 (Fig 26I,\nTable 5) wear was located over the apical area of the object, where depressions bearing a mean\nslope value of (13.8˚) were visible. The utilised area was characterised by a rough surface (TRI\nmean value 0.0021) becoming smoother towards the centre of the tool. The same pattern was\nevinced from VRM (mean value 0.0016), with a higher degree of topographic variation\ntowards the outer portion of the tool apical area and lower values characterising its inner por-\ntion. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the outer area of the tool’s apex suf-\nfered a higher degree of surface crushing compared to its inner area. The traces observed on\nRF-80 were relatively small with an average perimeter of 2.8 mm and an average area of 0.33\nmm\n2\n.

Use wear appeared dispersed over the apical area\nof the tool as indicated by the standard deviational ellipse value (1.3 ad).\nTwo distinctive functional areas were identified on artefact RF92 (Fig 27I, Table 5), one\nlocalised at the centre of the object and one corresponding to its apical area. The wear identi-\nfied on each of the FAs was related to two different activities, passive percussion (RF-92a) and\nmarginal retouching (RF92b). RF-92a was characterised by the presence of depressions with a\nmean slope value of 22.6˚, while more gentle slopes (mean value 15.6˚) characterised the\ndepressions identified over RF92b. The surfaces of both the functional areas exhibited a\nmedium to high degree of roughness, with RF92a exhibiting a TRI mean value of 0.0022 and\nRF-92b featuring a TRI mean value of 0.0029. A difference between the two surfaces was\nfound in their topographic variability. While RF92a was characterised by a low VRM mean\nvalue (0.0008), with the higher values corresponding to the bottom of the traces generated by\nuse, a higher variability characterised RF-92b (VRM mean value 0.0023) where higher values\nwere spread over the entire used surface. Traces observed on the central area exhibited a mean\nperimeter of 7mm and an average area of 1mm\n2\n. The damage was located close to the centre of\nthe tool (mean distance 10 mm) and were concentrated, as indicated by the standard devia-\ntional ellipse elongation value of 0.7ad.\nFig 24.

The utilised area of the tool was characterised by depressions bearing\na mean slope value of 9.6˚. Overall the surface topography was characterised by a medium to\nhigh degree of roughness (TRI mean value 0.0021) along with a low to medium degree of topo-\ngraphic variability (VRM mean value 0.0014). Traces related to use featured an average perim-\neter of 7 mm and an average area of 1 mm\n2\n.

The\nwear identified on the apical area was associated with the production of scaled retouching,\nwhile the traces affecting its short edge were related to percussion activity involving the pro-\nduction of blank and core management. The apical area of the tool was characterised by a\nmedium degree of surface roughness: TRI mean value 0.0015 (apical top) and TRI mean value\n0.0021 (apical bottom).

On both\nfunctional areas use related damage was dispersed over the surface as indicated by the recorded\nstandard deviational ellipse value of 1.3 ad. The short edge of RF127 was instead characterised\nby slightly steeper depressions (mean value 20˚) compared to the ones observed over its flat\nsurface. The topography of the surface was moderately rough (TRI mean value of 0.0021) with\nthe lower values coinciding with the area of the edge mostly affected by use related damage.\nThe surface topographic variability was low, given the VRM mean value of 0.0006. The traces\nidentified on the short edge of RF127 exhibited a mean perimeter of 2.7 mm and an average\narea of 1 mm\n2\n. They appeared highly dispersed over the utilised surface, as indicated by the\nhigh standard deviational ellipse elongation value of 2.5 ad (Fig 29, Table 5).\nDiscussion\nThrough the application of a dedicated experimental framework we were able to test the usage,\nand suitability for the task, of different areas of the hammerstone or retoucher. Use wear analy-\nsis, performed at low and high magnification, permitted the definition of the morphological\ncharacteristics of wear associated with each of the performed activities. In the study of\nFig 26. Archae ological items, RF67 (I) and RF80 (II), utilized in scaled retouc hing and marginal retouc hing.

GIS analysis allowed the investigation of the macro-traces from a quantitative\npoint of view, analysing aspects such as dimensions and spatial distribution of the wear gener-\nated by each activity. Moreover, it permitted the collection of data concerning the topographic\ncharacteristics (e.g. slope, roughness and topographic variability) of the utilised area of the\ntool.\nOverall, the dedicated experimental framework allowed the isolation of both qualitative and\nquantitative features concerning use wear deriving from both percussion and retouching activ-\nities. The microscopic analysis of the surfaces provided qualitative aspects such as development\nof polish, micro-striations etc. GIS analysis revealed quantitative data (distance from centre,\ndistance from edge and wear dispersion, this latter defined by the standard deviational ellipse\nelongation value) concerning the morphometry of use related damage associated to retouching\nactivity, bipolar percussion and core maintenance activities.\nComparing the experimental and archaeological datasets provided positive results (Figs 30,\n31 and 32), supporting interpretation derived from use wear analysis. However, on this matter,\na note of caution needs to be made. When the dimensions of damage were compared, those of\nthe wear on the experimental replicas resulted to be much larger than those observed on the\narchaeological materials. This is due to the post depositional alteration affecting the archaeo-\nlogical specimens and leading to an overall rounding and modification of the wear morphol-\nogy, suggesting that dimensions alone cannot be considered as a diagnostic feature in the\ninterpretation of tool use.\nTable 5.

In particular, artefacts RF67 and RF127 have been interpreted as retouchers used\nfor scaled retouching, while the apical area of artefact RF92 and RF80 exhibited use wear fea-\ntures which led to their interpretation as retouchers used to produce marginal retouching. On\n4 archaeological artefacts coming from Fumane Cave, the presence of overlapping pits over\nthe short edges of the tools (RF127, RF138) and of deep long striations affecting the flat surface\nof the implements (RF73, RF37) led to the interpretation of the artefacts as hammerstones\nused in both blank production and core maintenance activities. Wear patterns similar to the\nones associated with bipolar percussion have been identified on the central surface area of arte-\nfact RF92 leading to the interpretation of the use of its central area as an anvil (Fig 33). Our\nresults enabled the identification of specific functional patterns related to the use of hammer-\nstones and retouchers at Fumane Cave. We have been able to isolate specific patterns both\nregarding the morphology of the wear, its spatial distribution and the topography of the used\narea associated with each of the activities performed. This permitted the placing of the Proto-\naurignacian and Aurignacian macro-tools of Fumane Cave into specific stages of the produc-\ntion process of chipped tools. Our analysis underlined the high efficiency of the Fumane cave\nFig 30.

Furthermore, the analysis of the retouchers suggests relevant behavioural insights\nregarding the choice of objects with specific features (i.e. different types of limestones, soft or\ncompact; the morphological features that favours the success of the product;). Moreover, the\nanalysis of wear from a morphological and spatial point of view permitted to formulate a pre-\nliminary hypothesis, that will be confirmed in the future, under which the archaeological tools\nwere used employing two preferential gestures, perpendicular and oblique, involved in the\nproduction of scaled, marginal and abrupt retouches. The experimental results showed how,\nadopting a scaled retouch, it was possible not only to package or maintain formal tools such as\nend-scrapers, but also to delineate the lateral edges of some thicker blades. On the contrary,\nmarginal and abrupt retouch was mainly used to transform the flake/blade edges. Retouching\non an anvil, and edge abrasion techniques aimed at bladelet retouching, currently do not\nmatch with the archaeological traces and, following our results, it was difficult to use the flat\nsurface of the retoucher to perform the former activity. The absence of these types of use wear\ndoes not exclude that other raw materials and techniques have been used in the production of\nthe Dufour and pointed bladelets at Fumane Cave.\nConclusion\nGiven the lack of functional studies focused on the uses of hammerstones and retouchers, the\ncombined approach presented here enhances our current knowledge of this specific kind of\ntool. This approach provides data not only related to the use of the tools at the site (e.g. [128])\nbut also involving the gestures and ergonomic choices characterising the Protoaurignacian\nFig 32.

As emphasized by Bracco et al. [129] the\nreconstruction of gesture plays a major role within the analysis of technical processes. The\ntraces of prehension observed and documented during the experimental phase, and evidenced\nin the archaeological sample, reveal that in Fumane Cave there were different ways of handling\nthe objects. However, it is evident that the study of the variables on the modalities of prehen-\nsion requires the formulation of a specific experimental protocol.\nThe preliminary study conducted here showed the potentials of an integrated method\napplied to the study of prehistoric macro-lithic tools, which can be successfully increased in\nthe future with the support of a broader experimental collection. Our results emphasize the\nimportance of the combination of qualitative (use wear) and quantitative (GIS analysis)\napproaches which can be applied to a variety of tool categories, providing new data enhancing\nnot only our knowledge regarding the use of ancient Palaeolithic or Mesolithic tools but also,\nin a broader way, our understanding of ancient human behaviour.\nAcknowledgmen ts\nWe are grateful to Giulia Formichella for the drawing in Fig 6 and to the two anonymous\nreviewers for their careful reading of the manuscript and constructive comments, which\nhelped us to improve the first version of the article.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Isabella Caricola, Andrea Zupancich, Emanuela Cristiani.\nFunding acquisition: Emanuela Cristiani.\nInvestigation: Isabella Caricola, Andrea Zupancich, Daniele Moscone, Giuseppina Mutri,\nRossella Duches.\nMethodology: Isabella Caricola, Andrea Zupancich, Daniele Moscone, Marco Peresani, Ema-\nnuela Cristiani.\nProject administration: Emanuela Cristiani.\nSupervision: Marco Peresani, Emanuela Cristiani.\nValidation: Emanuela Cristiani.\nWriting – original draft: Isabella Caricola, Andrea Zupancich, Daniele Moscone, Giuseppina\nMutri, Armando Falcucci, Rossella Duches, Marco Peresani.\nWriting – review & editing: Marco Peresani, Emanuela Cristiani.\nReferences\n1.
