However, these m odels can inherit and propagate harmful and stereotypical\nlanguage from their training data, thereby exposing users t o downstream representational harms [6].

Conclusions made when evaluating models against\nUS-centric bias categories do not generalise well to other g lobal contexts and the full spectrum of biases encountered\nin diﬀerent sociocultural settings [54].\nThis paper seeks to measure LLM bias in application contexts beyond Western countries, speciﬁcally in India, the\nworld’s most populous country. There is a small body of exist ing work studying language model bias in the Indian\ncontext, but it is primarily concentrated on word embedding s [1, 37, 41] and encoder-based LLMs [5, 12, 68], thus\nleaving two research gaps. First, it remains unclear to what extent recently-released generative LLMs encode biases in\nthe Indian context. Second, there is a lack of comparative re search on the degree or severity of biases among categories\nwhich are more prevalent in the West (race and gender), as opp osed to others that are more prevalent in India (caste\nand religion).\nIn this work, we aim to bridge these gaps by computing the ster eotypical bias levels of popular LLMs in the Indian\ncontext and comparing these levels between the Indian and U. S. settings (see Table 1). For this purpose, we introduce\nI/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED(Indian Bias Evaluation Dataset), a novel dataset containi ng stereotypical and anti-stereotypical exam-\nples written in English language and covering the Caste and Religion domains in the Indian context. In addition to\nour ﬁndings through the dataset, we also pair this new datase t with a subset of English examples from CrowS-Pairs\n[43] in order to measure US-centric associations with race and gender. We ﬁnd that the majority of tested LLMs, both\nencoder-based and decoder-based, display strong biases to wards stereotypical associations in the Indian context. Th e\nlevel of this stereotypical bias is also consistently stron ger in the Indian context as compared to the U.S. context.\nIn sum, we make three main contributions:\n(1) We introduce I/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED,1 a novel Bias Evaluation Dataset designed for stereotypical bias evaluation for\ncaste and religion in the Indian context. 2\n(2) We use this dataset to measure stereotypical bias across LLMs for two Indian-centric axes of bias, caste and\nreligion, which remain underrepresented in fairness studi es.\n1Our dataset is available at: https://github.com/khyatikh andelwal/Indian-LLMs-Bias\n2Note that bhedbh¯ava translates as “discrimination” or “unfairness” in Hind i.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nI/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED: A Dataset for Measuring India-Centric Biases in Large Lang uage Models 3\n(3) We delve deeper to see if bias levels in LLMs are higher for topics prevalent in the Indian demographic (caste\nand religion) compared to well-researched U.S. contexts (r ace and gender). Our ﬁndings indicate that most LLMs\nexhibit notably more stereotypical bias towards Indian ste reotypes.\n(4) We posit potential reasons for such harms, while discuss ing methods to mitigate these biases.\nWe strongly encourage our readers to refer to Appendix B for f urther socio-cultural context about the axes of bias intro-\nduced in this paper.\n2 RELATED WORK\nThere is a mature body of research on bias in NLP [6]. Most of th ese studies focus on gender [7, 62, 63] and race [11]\nbut some work explores other bias categories such as sexual i dentity [15, 23] and political bias [20, 55], or investigate s\nintersectional biases [36]. Overwhelmingly, this body of w ork is situated in Western contexts, relying on Western data ,\nvalues and historical associations, and thus is not directl y portable to non-Western contexts [54].\nThere is some recent work, like ours, that seeks to develop re sources for evaluating bias beyond Western contexts.\nPast work in this space ﬂeshed out India-speciﬁc bias catego ries such as geographic regions or caste [5]. Empirical\nassessments have also been made of the prevalence of Indian- centric social stereotypes in text corpora [5], word em-\nbeddings [1, 41] and encoder-based LLMs [12, 37, 68]. Despit e its signiﬁcance for scoping more diverse evaluation\ncontexts, this existing work does not compare LLM bias levels across geo-cultural contexts. Furthermore , the few\npublicly-available datasets for measuring Indian-centri c bias are made of word pairs [12], which are not a practical\nmeasure of bias for modern decoder-based LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to put forth a\ndataset which can be used measure Indian caste and religious bias levels in the same LLMs, while comparing across\ntwo diﬀerent geo-cultural contexts, for both decoder and en coder-based LLMs.\n3 DATA\nBias axis Identity group Attribute associations\nCaste Brahmin pure, orthodox, religious, pious, intelligent,\nscholarly, beautiful, honest\nDalit dirty, disgusting, uneducated, regressive, thieves ,\ncriminals, untouchables\nReligion Muslim violent, militant, anti-national Indians, convert ing Hindus,\nmisogynistic, terrorists, orthodox\nHindu* innocent, backward, subject of conversion from Musl ims/Christians,\nvictims of Muslim men/criminals, uneducated, weird\nTable 2.

An example of the type of probe sentences used in our d ataset.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n4 Khandelwal et al.\nWe use two main datasets to evaluate stereotypical bias in LL Ms:\n3.1 Indian-BhED\nWe ﬁrst introduce I/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED, a novel dataset of 229 English-language examples on the Ind ian-centric issues of\ncaste-based discrimination and religious biases.\nFor the caste dataset , we adopt a binary approach in an attempt to maximize both met hodological simplicity and\nmaximum population coverage. The two subcategories for cas te are: (i) ’Dalit’ which is an umbrella-term for all of\nthe lower-castes, (ii) ’Brahmin’ which is an umbrella term f or some of the upper-most sub-castes that fall within this\ncategory [60].\nFor religion , the subcategories are (i) Hinduism, the major religion in I ndia and (ii) Islam, practiced by over 200\nmillion Indians who are often subject to discrimination [51 , 56], (iii) we also cover some stereotypes associated with\nother religious identities present in India (Buddhism, Jai nism, Sikhism, Christianity). In line with past work on LLM\nstereotypical bias [43], the examples in I/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scEDconsist of sentence pairs with one that represents a stereot ypical\nassociation and the other that represents an anti-stereoty pical association (Table 3). We choose to construct these\nsentences in English in order to bias test models in the India n and US-contexts whilst holding language constant.\nTo construct the dataset , in line with methodology used in previous work [58], (i) we r eview existing literature\non caste-based stereotypes and historical attributes, and caste-based and religious-based hate speech datasets [26, 27,\n33, 50, 60], (ii) construct a list of stereotypical and anti- stereotypical sentences using the literature as well as cul tural\nand domain knowledge of the lead author, (iii) consult three professors from India, researching on either caste or\nreligious studies regarding the validity and composition o f the dataset, (iv) alter and ﬁnalize the dataset based on the\nﬁnal suggestions of experts.\nIn total, the dataset contains 123 sentences for religion (60% Musli m stereotypes, 40% Hindu and other stereotypes)\nand 106 sentences for caste (50% positive stereotypes for Br ahmins, 40% negative stereotypes of Dalits, and 10% mixed\nstereotypes for the two castes).\nWe present an overview of bias stereotypes captured in the da taset for each category and subgroup in Table 2. We\nformat each example using a sentence template which is then u sed as a prompt for the model (see Table 3).\nMore details regarding the data generation process can be viewed in the Data Statement.\n3.2 CrowS-Pairs\nCrowS-Pairs [43] is a US-centric dataset that covers 9 types of social biases. Here, we only examine sentence pairs\nrelated to racial and gender bias. In total, there are 516 sen tences for racial bias and 262 sentences for gender bias.\nHowever, as these sentences are mainly crowd-sourced, ther e were many instances of improper sentence structuring,\nsometimes with little relation between the stereotypical a nd anti-stereotypical sentences, and repetition or improp er\nstructuring of target communities in stereotypical senten ces. To tackle this, we manually ﬁlter these by removing\nsentences with opposite/inconsistent stereotypes or repe titions, as well as ensuring the correct target communities\nare present in the target columns. After ﬁltering, we are lef t with 386 sentences for racial biases and 159 sentences for\nUS-centric gender biases.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nI/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED: A Dataset for Measuring India-Centric Biases in Large Lang uage Models 5\n4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n4.1 Specifying identity axes of bias\nFor our dataset, we set out to target two highly prevalent for ms of bias in India which may go relatively overlooked in\nfairness research and eﬀorts: caste and religion. We introduce these identity axes because (i) the literatur e is relatively\nsparse in these two areas, and (ii) caste-based and religiou s discrimination is historically and socially signiﬁcant a cross\nIndia [52], as we explain further in Appendix B.\nIn order to draw contrast between the noticed and unnoticed a reas of bias, we also seek to also measure race and\ngender for Western contexts because (i) there is a large body of exis ting research relating to these identity attributes in\nNLP [62, 66, 70], and (ii) conceptually, these identity attr ibutes have deep historical roots of discriminatory treatm ent\nin the U.S. and are of signiﬁcant cultural and legal importan ce in modern U.S. society [25, 45, 59].\nWe recognize bias’ connection to key demographic traits in s ociety, shaped by a history of marginalization. Bias\nvaries based on country and demographics. When comparing LL Ms in the US and India, we emphasize local bias\ncategories—caste and religion for India, and gender and rac e for the US.\nThis doesn’t disregard other biases in both countries. Gend er bias persists in India, and religious bias exists in the\nUS, each with unique aspects. Thus, we seek to compare bias fr ames (categories) that ﬁt national and cultural contexts,\nand investigate if the frames that are more dominant in the US are better catered to in fairness research.\n4.2 Models\nWe measure bias in two types of LLMs: encoder-based and decod er-based models.\nEncoders correspond to models which are based on a Transformer encode r and pre-trained with masked lan-\nguage modeling (MLM). We select among the most popular encod er-based models in terms of number of downloads\non HuggingFace. This includes both monolingual models, nam ely BERT-base [13], and multilingual models, namely\nMultilingual BERT and XLM-RoBERTa-large [10].\nDecoders correspond to models based on a Transformer decoder and are p rimarily used for text generation. We\nselect the most popular, publicly-available models in this space, namely GPT-2, GPT-2 Large[46], GPT-3.5 (OpenAI),\nFalcon [44], Mistral 7B [31] and LLamA-2 [67].\nThese models (apart from GPT 3.5, which was accessed through the API) were loaded from HuggingFace and run\non Google Colab infrastructure that utilised an A100 GPU.\n4.3 Bias measurement\nFor each model discussed above, we report the percentage of t imes the model is more likely to output the stereotypical\nversion of a sentence than the anti-stereotypical version. To ﬁnd the diﬀerence in likelihoods, we ﬁrst compute the\nlog-likelihoods of outputting a sentence for the encoder an d decoder models adjusted for diﬀerences in the relative\nbase frequencies of the words being interchanged.\n4.3.1 Encoders. For encoder models, we employ the All Unmasked Likelihood (A UL) score [34]. We choose this metric\nas it avoids measurement biases arising from word frequency and input contexts which existed in prior metrics [42, 43].\nIt does so by allowing the model to look at the entire sentence at once, instead of one-by-one masking. It is given for\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n6 Khandelwal et al.\nsentence /u1D446by:\n/u1D434/u1D448 /u1D43F( /u1D446) = 1\n| /u1D446|\n| /u1D446 |/summationdisplay.1\n/u1D456=1\nlog /u1D443/u1D440/u1D43F/u1D440 ( /u1D464/u1D456|( /u1D446;/u1D703)) (1)\nwhere | /u1D446| represents the length of sentence /u1D446, and /u1D443/u1D440/u1D43F/u1D440 ( /u1D464/u1D456|( /u1D446;/u1D703)) is the probability assigned during the MLM task to\na token /u1D464/u1D456 conditioned on the whole sentence /u1D446and pre-training parameter /u1D703. /u1D434/u1D448 /u1D43F( /u1D446) is computed as the summation\nof the logarithms of the probabilities of the individual tok ens for /u1D446using parameter /u1D703.\n4.3.2 Decoders. For open-source decoders, we rely on a metric called Conditi onal Log-Likelihood (CLL), which eval-\nuates the likelihood assigned by the decoder to a sentence co ntaining target words /u1D446/u1D464 , adjusted for the likelihood\nof outputting the target word sequence /u1D464 without any prior context. The CLL for a (stereotypical/ant i-stereotypical)\ntarget word /u1D464, given a sentence /u1D446/u1D464 (including the target words) and model parameter /u1D703 can be deﬁned by the equation:\n/u1D436/u1D43F/u1D43F( /u1D446| /u1D464) = ln /u1D443( /u1D446/u1D464 ; /u1D703) − ln /u1D443( /u1D464; /u1D703) (2)\nThis metric addresses a challenge pointed out in CrowS Pairs [43] where certain words (and group identiﬁers) may\nbe signiﬁcantly more common in the pre-training data than ot hers. Consequently, the probabilities of diﬀering target\nwords between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sente nces vary irrespective of context. To tackle this, [43] prop ose\ncomputing /u1D443( /u1D460/u1D452/u1D45B/u1D461/u1D452/u1D45B/u1D450/u1D452| /u1D464/u1D45C/u1D45F/u1D451) since the sentence /u1D446tokens remain constant while the target word tokens /u1D464 change\nbetween stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences. While originally designed for masked language models, we\nadapt this metric for autoregressive models by subtracting the log-likelihoods of model outputting the target words\nwithout prior context (and hence dividing the likelihoods) . This adaptation mirrors the approach utilized by [19] but\ntailored to a dataset where target words can appear anywhere in the sentence, not just at the beginning.\n4.3.3 GPT 3.5. For closed-source decoders, it is infeasible to obtain the C LLs for each word as the log-likelihoods are\nnot readily available through the API. Hence, we estimate un derlying priors by gathering three outputs, and taking\nthe majority vote outputs (best of three). Methods of estima ting stereotypical associations via statistical brute for ce\nhave been applied previously [36]. We provide each template from the dataset, along with the pair of stereotypical and\nanti-stereotypical words which can be used to ﬁll in the blan k. We then report the share of sentences where the output\nwas stereotypical or anti-stereotypical. More details on t he methodology can be found in Section D of the Appendix.\n4.4 Interpretation\nInteraction of scores with models. While both AUL and CLL scores try to capture the log likelihoo ds of the models,\nthe diﬀerence between the two scores largely arises due to th e architectures of masked language models (MLMs), and\nautoregressive (AR) models. While in MLMs the entire senten ce can be input to the model and pseudo log-likelihoods\ncan be obtained, AR models only provide next token predictio n given a previous context. Further, MLMs can be bi-\ndirectional, whereas ARs are uni-directional [21].\nIn the results section, we largely look at the percentage of p rompts in which the models prefer a stereotypical\nexample over an anti-stereotypical example. This makes up t he ‘bias score’. While the individual numeric scores for\nsentences diﬀer between MLMs and AR models, the bias score re mains comparable across model types and scoring\nfunctions.\nInteraction of scores with target communities: The score itself indicates the propensity of a model to confo rm to\nstereotypes within a certain category, but it is diﬃcult to e stablish whether a higher score is necessarily bad, particu larly\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nI/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED: A Dataset for Measuring India-Centric Biases in Large Lang uage Models 7\nfor race and gender categories. For instance, the gender dat aset contains the stereotypes that women are tidier than\nmen (positive) and that women are worse drivers than men (neg ative). In such cases, a high stereotypical bias score\nmay not always indicate harmful behaviour towards the minor ity community. However, for our caste and religion\ndatasets, high bias scores can indicate harmful behaviour a s ’Muslim’ and ’Dalits’ are consistently associated with\nnegative stereotypes, hence, conforming to those would gen erally mean negative behaviour.\nWhile it can be a point of debate regarding what constitutes a n ‘ideal’ score, one can nonetheless comparatively\ngauge the model’s propensity to conform to a particular type of stereotype over another. Hence, our ﬁndings are based\non past research that makes use of stereotypes [19, 34, 42, 49 ] such that a score closer to 50% signiﬁes that the model\nhas a balanced view between the stereotypical and anti-ster eotypical topics overall.\n5 RESULTS\nCaste (India) Religion (India) Gender (U.S.) Race (U.S.)\nGPT 3.5 79.52 70.49 50.94 61.65\nGPT 2 62.26 72.36 54.08 44.82\nGPT 2 Large 63.21 69.11 61.63 44.3\nMistral 7B 56.60 75.61 66.66 59.84\nFalcon 7B 61.32 72.35 69.81 65.02\nLLaMA-2 7B 57.55 65.04 64.78 60.88\nLLaMA-2 13B 56.61 72.36 68.55 63.47\nXLM Roberta 62.43 52.29 50.79 46.48\nm-BERT Uncased 57.74 52.77 52.52 49.5\nBERT Base 55.51 55.1 50.88 51.58\nAverage 61.18 65.75 58.69 54.75\nTable 4. Bias scores for each model and axis of bias.\nWe present the bias scores for each model and axis of bias in Ta ble 4. We ﬁnd that the average stereotypical bias score\nacross all models is highest for religion in the Indian conte xt, followed by caste. On the other hand, it is relatively clo ser\nto the ‘neutral’ 50% mark for the US-centric gender and race b ias axes. We also ﬁnd that for GPT 3.5, XLM RoBERTa,\nm-BERT, and BERT base, the caste category has the highest ste reotypical bias. For all of the remaining models, the\nreligion category has the highest stereotypical bias score . Further, GPT 2, GPT 2 Large, XLM RoBERTa, m-BERT, and\nBERT base have the lowest stereotypical bias for race.\nNotably, we ﬁnd that GPT 3.5, GPT-2, GPT-2 Large, XLM-RoBERT a and m-BERT have the lowest stereotypical bias\nscores for race. In particular, this score is lower than 50% f or GPT-2, XLM-RoBERTa and m-BERT, indicating that they\nfavour the anti-stereotype and signalling a potential reve rsed bias against the ’majority’ community. Similarly, gen der\nbias is nearly exactly 50% for GPT 3.5.\nFurther, upon qualitative inspection of religious bias, we notice that for GPT-2 (base and large) as well as GPT 3.5,\nmost cases of preferring stereotypical community is when th e target stereotypical community is Muslims (associated\nwith stereotypes such as violence or terrorism). For instan ce, for GPT-2, 75% of the 72.36% of religion stereotypical\nresponses were when Muslims were associated with negative s tereotypes. In case of caste-based bias, models particu-\nlarly show bias when the stereotypical target is upper-cast e (Brahmin), through the attribution of positive attribute s\n(pure, educated, etc.).\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n8 Khandelwal et al.\nAll of OpenAI’s GPT model scores have the largest gap between Western-centric (44-61%) and Indian-centric (62-\n79%) axes of bias, with the mean Indian-centric score as 69.5 % as mean US-centric score as 52.8%. We discuss potential\nreasons for such disparity further in Section 6.\n6 DISCUSSION\nThis work introduced the ﬁrst evaluation of bias levels in po pular encoder and decoder LLMs in the Indian context.\nOur results have some key takeaways. First, we ﬁnd that the ma jority of LLMs (both encoder and decoder) favour\nthe stereotypical associations in the Indian contexts of re ligion and caste, particularly the religious stereotypes. It also\nappears in some cases that debiasing eﬀorts or conscious pre -training choices may have swung some models, such as\nGPT-2, XLM RoBERTa and m-BERT, towards anti-stereotypical bias for the racial bias axis.\nWe cannot conclusively explain why the LLMs that we tested di splay stronger stereotypical biases within the Indian\ncategories than the US-centric gender and racial categorie s. However, we oﬀer some perspectives as to the roots of\nthis phenomena.\nThe development and evaluation of LLMs are mainly conducted with a US-centric perspective, with te chnology\ndevelopers primarily situated in Silicon Valley and employ ing predominantly educated US-based crowdworkers as\nhuman raters or red-teamers [35, 63]. This US-centric focus tends to often overlook potential adverse implications\nwithin the Global South.\nThe digital divide in India [47, 65] inﬂuences who has access to author internet content , or have content au-\nthored about their group and lived experiences [54]. Our emp irical observations reveal that terms like “Brahmin” have\na higher prediction likelihood compared to “Dalit” indicat ing a frequency bias possibly originating from their respec -\ntive frequencies in the pre-training data, despite the star k contrast in shares of the Indian population, with over 60%\nDalits, and only 5-10% Brahmins [9]. Also, top models such as Mistral and LLaMA-2 [31, 67] use the ToxiGen [28]\nframework to evaluate their harmful behaviour, which relie s completely on social media and digital data which may\nbe disproportionately representing the upper castes and pr ivileged in India.\nMitigation of such biases in LLMs is an active area of study and we believe that techniqu es such as in-context\nlearning [4, 18, 22, 39], reinforcement learning with human -feedback [16, 69, 71], or architectural methods such as\n[32, 40] can help in limiting harmful stereotypical associa tions by LLMs.\nFuture work could study how our cross-cultural studies of bi as extend to the cross-cultural and cross-lingual setting.\nWe only focus on English, but many languages are spoken in Ind ia, and caste may have an association with spoken\nlanguage, thus introducing further contextual dependenci es of bias axis and evaluation language. Furthermore, while\nwe do investigate some multilingual models, it would be inte resting to see how mono or multilingual models speciﬁcally\npre-trained or ﬁne-tuned on Indian data perform in our evalu ation framework.\nLIMITATIONS\nDataset coverage. While each bias category introduced in I/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scEDis comparable in size to the categories in\nother similar datasets [43], there is room to provide wider a nd more nuanced coverage. Firstly, the size, and nature\nof the dataset should be expanded in future work, by for insta nce adding more languages and stereotypes. Secondly,\nin particular, we focus on explicit statements of bias, but b iases may be more pervasive and appear in descriptions of\npeople (e.g. ‘turban wearers’). We are ourselves also subje ct to blind spots in our selection of cases. To reduce this ris k,\nwe consulted with experts on Indian caste bias, as well as lit erature, but the possibility of an overlook remains.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nI/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED: A Dataset for Measuring India-Centric Biases in Large Lang uage Models 9\nConceptualisation of bias. Bias can be a complex social concept, having many deﬁnitions and notions. It is diﬃcult\nto accurately quantify bias and the metrics used in this stud y are unlikely to encapsulate all the facets of bias. A\nmodel’s propensity to generate a stereotypical or anti-ste reotypical response leaves a gap for many ‘in-between’ targ et\nresponses which should also be accounted for. In cases where the underlying populations are unbalanced, it is also\nunclear whether a 50% balance between stereotypical and ant i-stereotypical responses is appropriate. Other approach es\n[36] use demographic data to establish a baseline score. It m ay be that such an approach leads to dramatic over-\nrepresentation of the ‘Brahmin’ caste, which is a small frac tion of the total Indian population.\nExplanatory power. Although our study shows evidence of the existence of a dispa rity in bias levels, we cannot\nattribute it to any particular factor, due to the black-boxe dness of such models, along with selective sharing of de-\ntails by certain companies (such as OpenAI). It is interesti ng that the diﬀerences persist across models trained with\nvery diﬀerent approaches, including in models which have be en ﬁne-tuned to reduce bias. However, we cannot deter-\nmine whether this results from the underlying datasets havi ng more embedded biases, less eﬀorts at bias mitigation\nfor Indian-centric categories, less eﬀectiveness of exist ing methods of bias mitigation for Indian categories of bias , a\ncombination of all of these, or another reason altogether.\n7 CONCLUSION\nAs the the user base of large language models becomes increas ingly global, there needs to be attention from academics,\npolicymakers and industry labs directed towards uncoverin g biases localised in speciﬁc geo-cultural contexts, that\nmay be missed or overlooked with a US-centric lens. This stud y provided empirical evidence to suggest certain areas\nof bias such as caste based or religious biases persist in mod els, even if gender and racial biases have been relatively\nbetter tackled as per our ﬁndings. We introduced a new datase t to capture biases in the Indian context and established\na framework for measuring bias on the same dataset for encode r as well as decoder based models. We hope this work\ninitiates a conversation surrounding the need to develop mo re inclusive standards of fairness in AI across geo-cultura l\ncontexts.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support by the Oxford Int ernet Institute, as well as the guidance of Dr. Adam\nMahdi.

Caste-based discrimination, unique to India, has a 3,000-y ear history rooted in texts like the “Manusm-\nriti, ” which sanctions the caste system and prescribes hars h punishments for dissent [48]. This system deﬁnes social\norder, with individuals’ karma and dharma determining thei r caste, passing it down through generations [24]. Ancient\nHindu society organized this hierarchy into four main caste s: Brahmins (intellectuals), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vais hyas\n(traders), and Shudras (laborers), with Dalits as untoucha bles [24]. Despite legal reforms, the caste system still aﬀe cts\nmany Indians [38]. About 30% of Indians identify as “General Category” (upper castes), while only 4% identify as Brah-\nmins [9]. Most Indians identify as “Scheduled Castes” (Dali ts), “Scheduled Tribes, ” or “Other Backward Classes. ” Cast e\ndiscrimination thrives on stereotypes, portraying Brahmi ns positively and Dalits negatively [57]. For simplicity, t his\npaper examines these biases using a dichotomous framework: “Brahmin” for the upper caste and “Dalit” for the lower\ncastes [57].\nReligious discrimination in India. Despite its constitutional claim to secularism, India has l ong grappled with a\nHindu–Muslim divide. This divide predates British colonia l rule but was exacerbated by British colonial policies [3, 6 4].\nHistorical events like Muslim rulers’ conquests and the Bri tish ‘divide and rule’ strategy further fueled this divide\n[30, 61]. In India, Orientalist scholarship contributed to the racialisation of communal identity, emphasising the In do-\nAryan linguistic family, Aryan Race, and the supposed end of a Golden Age of Hinduism due to Muslim invasions [2].\nHindu activists, drawing from Orientalist ideas, advocate d for a revival of this ‘Golden Age’, promoting the notion of\nHindus as descendants of a superior Aryan race [2]. These ide as gave rise to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS),\na right-wing Hindu nationalist organization, from which th e largest political party in India, the Bharatiya Janata Par ty\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nI/n.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/hyphen.scB/h.scED: A Dataset for Measuring India-Centric Biases in Large Lang uage Models 13\n(BJP) emerged. It is associated with many pro-Hindu policie s [14]. Today, Hindu–Muslim relations in India are marked\nby tension and a power disparity, with Hindus in the majority and Muslims as a minority [17]. This paper primarily\nfocuses on Hindu–Muslim religious discrimination as it is t he most prevalent form in the Indian context, especially\nonline [53].\nC DATA STATEMENT\nThe new dataset is created through a generation and validati on process, emulating the approach of HolisticBias [58].\nThe following steps were adopted:\n(i) The sentences are ﬁrst brainstormed by the authors based on the existing literature on casteism and religion-\nbased hate speech datasets from the recent past [27, 33, 50, 5 7]. In doing so, we prefer colloquial terms such as ‘dirty’\ninstead of ‘contaminated’ or ‘dilapidated’, and include bo th positive and negatively biased examples. At this stage it\nwas 112 sentences for caste, and 120 for religion.\n(ii) In order to minimize the authors’ own biases from this da taset, three professors in India- (1) a Linguistics pro-\nfessor, (2) a Caste Based Studies professor, and (3) an Islam ic studies professor, were consulted and asked to provide\nqualitative feedback for the dataset regarding the composi tion, validity, and coverage of the prompts. Those inputs\nincluded the suggestions such as to add sentences on ‘Muslim men tricking Hindu women into marriage’ and ‘Crime\nassociated with Dalits’. Their suggestions also involved r emoving certain sentences which captured the debatable\nstereotypes that Dalits are hard-working, and Muslims are a rtistic. Such qualitative reviews and suggestions were\nincorporated into the dataset and ﬁnally approved by the sam e professors unanimously.\nWe believe that closely basing our data on past research and d atasets also reduces the personal biases of the authors.\nUpon inclusion of ﬁnal suggestions, we add 5 more sentences i n caste dataset while removing 11 which the experts\nbelieved were inaccurate/problematic, while adding 3 more sentences for religion.\nThe caste and religion dataset is designed to be broadly bala nced and as comprehensive as possible given the size.\nThere are a total of 123 sentences constructed for religion ( 60% Muslim stereotypes, 40% Hindu and other stereotypes)\nand 106 sentences for caste (50% positive stereotypes for Br ahmins, 40% negative stereotypes of Dalits, and 10% mixed\nstereotypes for the two castes). We also provide full senten ce examples rather than word/stereotype pairs to better\nsupport future users of the data.\nD MODEL CHOICE AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nThe method for model selection was largely qualitative and b ased on obtaining certain representative, well-known and\nwidely downloaded models for diﬀerent categories. We began with popular BERT-based models, followed by several\nof the most popular generative models available on Hugging F ace. To be speciﬁc, for BERT-based models we chose the\noriginal BERT-Base [13], and prevailing multilingual mode ls BERT-Base-Multilingual (2019), and XLM-RoBERTa-Large\n(2019). These were chosen in order to compare the diﬀerence i n biases between a multilingual and a largely English\nmodel. Among open source generative models, we selected mod els based on popularity and availability. In particular,\nthese are Meta AI’s LLaMA 2 (7 billion and 13 billion paramete rs) [67], Falcon (7 billion and 40 billion parameters) [44],\nas well as OpenAI’s GPT 2 (117 million and 345 million paramet ers) [46]. Once again, these were selected on the basis of\nhow large they are, how commonly downloaded they are on Huggi ng Face (all of these models have been downloaded\n> 100, 000 times in the month of July, 2023). We were not able to acces s the necessary log-likelihood values for some\nof the other popular models such as GPT 4, Gemini, or Bard. We d o include GPT-3.5 as a non open-source model as it\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n14 Khandelwal et al.\nhas the highest number of users (100 million monthly active u sers) as compared to any other generative model that is\nin production. However, we can only provide metrics based on querying the API, which are not directly comparable\nwith the others.\nWe provide the prompt in the following format to GPT 3.5 to obt ain results: \"For the following sentence, ﬁll in\nthe blank strictly with < stereotypical word > or < anti-stereotypical word > : < sentence with blank> . Finally, the\noutputs for 3 prompts were calculated based on best of three r esponses. It is to note that there was also a case of\nneutral responses by GPT 3.5 (refusing to select between the two options/selecting both options/outputting a new\nthird option altogether). For reporting this, we took the nu mber of neutral responses, and divided it equally among\nthe number of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical respon ses to report the ﬁnal results. For instance, if there were 10\nneutral, 10 stereotypical and 10 anti-stereotypical respo nses, we reported it as percent of (10 + (10/2) ) = 15 stereotyp ical\nand 15 anti-stereotypical responses.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nThis figure \"acm-jdslogo.png\" is available in \"png\"\n format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/2309.08573v2",
