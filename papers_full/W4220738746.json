  "abstract": "Power transformers play an important role in the safe and reliable operation of the whole power grid. Once a fault occurs, it will endanger the normal operation of the transformer, and even result in power grid accidents. Accurate and practical methods of transformer fault monitoring and type identification have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrical engineering. However, it is difficult to obtain a large number of measurement data for different fault types on a large power transformer. The vibroacoustic characteristics of transformer faults have significant asymmetry. For the power transformer in service, it is complex and uneconomic to obtain the vibroacoustic signals under different fault conditions. To handle this problem, this paper proposes simulation methods of several common transformer core faults, based on multi-physical field coupling, and then analyzes the vibroacoustic signals generated by the operating transformer. Finally, it verifies the results of acoustic and vibration signals under several faults, through physical experiments. The results show that the transformer fault simulation method is reasonable and accurate. Furthermore, a change in the transformer core state will cause a change in the transformer vibroacoustic characteristics, and different types of core faults can be distinguished by the analysis of vibroacoustic characteristics.",
