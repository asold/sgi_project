Power transformer life ends \nbefore the predicted time because of lack of \ninsulation monitoring. Solid and Liquid insulation \nsystem used in transformer are designed to \nwithstand stresses like Power frequency voltage and \ntransient stresses like light ning impulses, switching \nimpulses and short circuits. The deterioration of \nsolid insulation system may be examined by various \nmethodologies like analysis of furan content and \nDegree of Polymerization. Monitoring of liquid \ndielectrics is achieved by examining various critical \nparameters like acidity, BDV, viscosity, volume \nresistivity, loss tangent and Dielectric constant. \nKohtoh et al. presented a characteristics analysis of \n \noil for samples heated to nu mber of days. Han et al. \npresented various condition monitoring techniques \nfor electrical equipments. Kohtoh et al. discussed \nabout aging effect on electrical characteristics of \ninsulating oil due to degrad ation. Syed Islam et al. \npresented a methodology to determine the furan \ncompounds in oil. In this paper as an initiative work, \nsame samples were subjected to different hours of \nthermal degradation. Various pattern changes in the \ncharacteristics of oil due to degradation were \nstudied. An exclusive Thermal –UV analysis were \ncarried out, in which degraded transformer oil were \nsubjected to UV-Visible light and their spectral \nresponses were examined. Based on the bandwidth \n(nm) and absorption capability of transformer oil, \nlevel of degradation can be determined. \n256 Radha and Thangaswamy \nActa Scientiarum. Technology Maringá, v.  35, n. 2, p. 255-262, Apr.-June, 2013 \nMaterial and methods \nExperiments are conducted as per American \nSociety of Testing and Materials (ASTM, 2012 a \nand b), Indian standa rds (IS, 1992) and \nInternational Electrotechnical Committee (IEC, \n2004) standards, variou s standards adopted are \npresented in Table1. Same sample of oil is used \nfor different thermal ageing test, UV response of \noil were analysed. In thermal ageing test \nmaximum temperature maintained is of 100ºC \nand the testing apparatus was provided with air \ntight sealed environment.  \nVarious modules of test conducted in this work \nare of  \n1. Thermal Degradation test on pure transformer \noil. \n2. Thermal Degradation test on transformer oil \nalong with Press board and Kraft paper. \n3. Exclusive Thermal-UV response test on pure \ntransformer oil. \n4. Exclusive Thermal-UV response test on \ntransformer oil with Kraft paper and Pressboard. \nIn case of thermal degradation test, pure oil is \nsubjected to heating hours of 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, \n20, 24 and 30. For thermal degradation transformer \noil along with insulation Kraft paper and Press board \nsubjected to heating hours of 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18 and \n20.  \nIn thermal UV visible property analysis of \ntransformer oil, the test is conducted on pure \ntransformer oil and also with the combination of \nKraft paper and press board. Based on the index \nresults obtained for bandwidth and absorption peak \nof various samples of transformer oil we can \nindirectly determine the level of degradation of \ntransformer oil. \nTable 1. Standards for testing. \nS.no Parameters Testing standards adopted \n1 BDV IS6792 (IS, 1992)  \n2 Flash Point ASTM D 3828 (ASTM, 2012a)  \n3 Fire Point ASTM D 3828 (ASTM, 2012a)  \n4 Viscosity ASTM D 2162-06, IP 70 (ASTM, 2012b)\n5 Volume resistivity IEC 60247 (IEC, 2004) \n6 Dielectric constant IEC 60247 (IEC, 2004)  \n7 Loss factor IEC 60247 (IEC, 2004)  \n8 Acidity BS 2000 Part 1 (BS, 2010)  \n \nBreak down voltage is the ability of oil to \nwithstand stresses withou t failure. Breakdown \nstrength analysis of tran sformer oil gives effective \nresults through which suitable dielectric material \nfor the related high voltage applications can be \nexplored. The tests are carried as per Indian \nstandard (IS, 1992) specifications. Acidity is a \nmeasure of free organic and inorganic acid present \nin the oil and expressed in terms of milligrams of \nPotassium Hydroxide (KOH) required to \nneutralize the total free acids in one gram of oil. \nPresence of these acid contents in oil causes \ndetrimental to insulation system and leads to \ncorrosion of transformer tank. Acidity level of \ntransformer oil is measured as per British \nStandard (BS, 2010). Flash point of a volatile \nliquid is the lowest temperature at which it can \nvaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air. The \nFire point is defined as the temperature at which \nthe vapour continues to burn after being ignited. \nIt is the lowest temperature at which, on further \nheating beyond the flash point, the sample \nsupport and combustion for five seconds. Flash \nand fire point test is carried out in Pensky-\nMartens apparatus as per ASTM (ASTM, 2012a).  \nThe perfect dielectric can be represented as \nlumped perfect capacitance. When a Sinusoidal \nAC voltage is applied the charging current flowing \nin the capacitance leads the voltage by angle 90º. \nHowever in realistic insu lation systems the angle \nis less than 90º due to losses caused by conduction \nand polarization current. The complement of \nangle between voltage and current vectors is \ncalled dielectric loss of angle δ or dielectric loss \nangle. The tangent of this angle δ provides an \nindication of losses in insulation and is known as \nPower factor or Dielectric Dissipation factor. The \ntests are carried out as per IEC standards (IEC, \n2004). Viscosity of o il is the measure of \ntransformer oil resistance to  shear. Viscosity varies \ninversely with temperature. Viscosity is measured \nusing Red wood viscometer at the temperature of \n30ºC. The test is carried out as per ASTM \nstandard (ASTM, 2012b).Various samples of \nTransformer Oil (TO) for the first two modules \nof test with their combination of materials are \ngiven in the Table 2. \nTable2.

Technology Maringá, v.  35, n. 2, p. 255-262, Apr.-June, 2013 \nResults and discussion \nThermal degradation test on pure transformer oil \nInitial test results for pure transformer oil are given \nin the Table 3. In thermal degradation test all the test \nsamples were heated for 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24 \nand 30 hours. Test is conducted to simulate the real \ntime aging of oil only due to heat source. Maximum \ntemperature maintained inside the apparatus is of \n100ºC. Various changes in the critical characteristics \nlike BDV, Flash point, Fire point, UV response, Loss \nfactor, Resistivity, Dielectric constant, Acidity and \nViscosity were examined.  \nTable 3. Initial Sample readings. \nParameters Value \nAcidity (mg KOH gm-1) 0.0269 \nViscosity(centistokes) 20.06 \nBreakdown Voltage(kV/2.5 mm) 15 \nFlash Point(ºC) 160 \nFire Point(ºC) 220 \nABS 0.1479 U.V. \nResponse T % 82.32 \nVolume Resistivity(Ωcm) (one minute value) 339 x 10\n9 \nLoss Tangent at 90ºC 0.1444 \nDielectric Constant 1.08 \n \nTest results for thermal degradation of \ntransformer oil are given in Table 4. Figure 1a shows \nthe variation of acidity to hours of heating. The \nacidity value increased up to 10 hours of heating \nfrom 0.02940 to 0.03457 mg KOH g\n-1. Heating of \npure oil for hours alone does not create acidity, \nvarious factors like moisture content and other \nimpurities causes the oxidation of transformer oil \nthereby increase the level of acidity. The oxidation \nprocess continues till the impurities are consumed. \nThe acid level did not increased beyond 10 hours \nwhich indicates that all the impurities responsible \nfor oxidative process have been consumed and \nhence no further oxidation and increase in acidity \nupon further heating. However from the test results \nit is conferred that whenever oil is heated up to 30 \nhours, the level of acid content (0.034 mg KOH g\n-1-\nsaturated) was up to accepted level as per BS \nstandard (BS 2000 Part 1). Figure 1b shows the \nvariation of viscosity to hours of heating, viscosity \nvalue shows a sharp increase at 10 hours of heating \nand then trends to decrease down rapidly, therefore \nflow rate of oil get increased. \nFigure 1c shows the variation of BDV to hours of \nheating. BDV gets increased at the initial stage, the \nreason is the moisture content in oil gets evaporated at \ninitial stage. On increasing the hours of heating it \ntrends to decrease rapidly. Fig.1d shows the variation of \nFlash point to hours of heating. Flash point variation \nshows a steady level up to 18 hours of heating, and \nthen its value gets sharp increase in 24 hours of heating, \nbut finally the characteristics shows a steady margin \nvalue at 160 to 161ºC.  \nFigure 1e shows the variation of Fire point to \nhours of heating. Fire po int value characteristics \nshows a rapid increase for 10 hours of heating and \nthen it tends to lower, finally after 18 hours of \nheating the value gets saturated in the range of \n230ºC.  \nFigure 1f shows the variation of absorption peak \nto hours of heating, at the initial stage of heating the \ncharacteristics shows a rapid increase and after hours \nof heating it shows downward  trends characteristics. \nFigure 1g shows the variation of transmission to \nhours of heating, transmissi on characteristics of oil \nshows a rapid increase during initial 12 hours of \nheating, finally it obtains the level of saturation. \nFigure 1h shows the variation of Volume resistivity \nto hours of heating. Volume resistivity at initial stage \nshows a peak increase, but when the oil is heated the \nvalue of volume resistivity trends to decrease. It is \nconferred that resistivity value of oil reduces on days \nof heating. Figure 1i shows the  variation of loss \nangle to hours of heating. Dissipation factor value at \ninitial stage shows a higher value but on further \nheating the dissipation fact or value gets decreased. \nFigure 1j shows the variation of Dielectric constant \nto hours of heating. Dielec tric constant at initial \nstage gets lowered and then it shows a steady \nincrease. The above test results provide information \nabout characteristics changes of pure transformer oil \nfor different levels of thermal degradation.  \nTable 4.

Test is conducted to \nsimulate the real time thermal degradation of oil \nalong with deterioration of solid insulation like press \nboard and Kraft paper. The total weight of Press \nboard and Kraft paper mixed along with oil is of 300 \ngm. Maximum temperature maintained inside the \napparatus is of 100ºC. Various changes in the critical \ncharacteristics like BDV, Flash point, Fire point, UV \nresponse, Loss factor, Resistivity, Dielectric \nconstant, Acidity and Viscosity were examined. Test \nresults for Thermal Degradation test on oil along \nwith Press board and paper is given in Table 5. \nFigure 2a shows the variation of acidity to hours \nof heating. Acidity value slowly increase at the initial \nstage of heating up to 10 hours of heating, after 20 \nhours of heating it remains unchanged. It shows that \nacidity value after 30 hours of heating was within the \naccepted level. Figure 2b shows the variation of \nviscosity to hours of heating. Viscosity value shows a \nsharp increase at 7 hours of heating and then trends \nto decrease down rapidly th erefore flow rate of oil \ngets increased. Figure 2c shows the variation of BDV \nto hours of heating. BDV gets increases at the initial \nstage the reason is the moisture content in oil gets \nevaporated at starting stage. On increasing the hours \nof heating BDV trends to decrease rapidly.  \nFigure 2d shows the variation of Flash point to \nhours of heating. Flash point values at the initial stage \ngets sharp increase and on further heating it gets \nreduced. Figure 2e shows the variation of Fire point to \nhours of heating. Fire point value shows increasing \ntrend characteristics and more or less it attains a \nsaturated value after 15 hours. Figure 2f shows the \nvariation of Absorption peak to hours of heating. At the \ninitial stage the peak absorption value sharply increases \nup to 9 hours of heating and then it shows a moderate \nincrease. Figure 2g shows the variation of \nTransmission to hours of heating. Transmission \nproperty of oil shows a variation of up and down value, \nat one stage (18 hours) the value starts to decrease. \nFigure 2h shows the variation of Volume resistivity to \n0.04 \n0.035 \n0.03 \n0.025 \n0 20 40 \n20 \n10 \n0 \n0 10 20 30 40\n40\n20\n0\n0 10 20 30 40\n162 \n161\n160\n159\n158 \n0 10 20 30 40 \n210 \n200 \n190 \n180 \n0 10 20 30 40\n0.145\n0.14\n0.135\n0.13\n0 10 20 30 40\n85 \n84.5 \n84 \n83.5 \n83\n0 10 20 30 40 \n500\n0\n0 10 20 30 40 \n0.5 \n0 \n0 20 40 \n2\n1\n0\n0 10 20 30 40\nTransformer oil response 259 \nActa Scientiarum.

Volume resistivity value obtained in \nthe sample of oil along with press board and Kraft \npaper is very high compared to characteristics value of \npure oil. Volume resistivity at initial stage shows a peak \nincrease, but when the oil is heated the value of \nvolume resistivity trends to decrease. It is conferred \nthat resistivity value of oil reduces on days of heating. \nFigure 2i shows the variation of Loss angle to hours of \nheating. Loss factor value obtained in the sample of oil \nalong with press board and Kraft paper is very low \ncompared to characteristics value of pure oil. \nDissipation factor value at initial stage shows a higher \nvalue but on further heating the dissipation factor value \ngets decreased.

The test results provide \nexcellent information about the correlation of \nelectrical characteristics like BDV, volume resistivity \nand loss factor.  \nFigure 3a shows the variation of loss factor to \nvolume resistivity. Samp les with press board and \nKraft paper have very high est value of resistivity. \nIt is clearly confirmed that loss factor value \nsteadily decreases for increase of volume \nresistivity. Figure 3b sh ows the variation of loss \nfactor to BDV, it is clearly identified that \nwhenever the loss factor increases, the BDV value \nshows steady decrease. Figure 3c shows the \nvariation of Volume resistivity to BDV. It is \nclearly recognized that on increase in values of \nresistivity the with stand capability BDV of \ntransformer oil show s a rapid increase. \nExclusive Thermal-UV response test on Transformer oil \nUV-Visible spectrophotometer is used to \nanalyse the transmission an d absorption capability \nof oil. As per IS, IEC, ASTM standards spectral \nresponse analysis is not a mandatory test for liquid \ndielectrics. Experiment is carried out with UV-\nVisible spectrophotomete r having single beam \nfacility. Test is conduct ed for various hours of \nheating of pure transforme r oil, based on the test \nresults like wavelength and Peak absorption we \ncan determine the level of thermal degradation of \noil as an indirect methodology. The wave length \nof pure transformer oil lies in the UV region \n(200-300 nm) and test results are presented in \nTable 6. \nExclusive thermal -UV response test on oil with Kraft \npaper and press board \nIn exclusive thermal UV-Visible test pure oil is \nmixed with kraft paper of weight 10 gm, thickness \nof 5 mm and press bo ard weight 105 gm, \nthickness of 4 mm. Kraft paper and Press board \non degradation generates fu ran derivatives such as \n5 Hydroxy methyl furan, 5Methyl furan, 2 Acetyl \nfuran and 2 Furaldehyde (2FAL). One of the main \nfuran derivatives is of 2 FAL which is a key factor \nfor determining strength of solid insulation paper. \nThese furan derivatives have the wave length of \nrange 250-380 nm. Based on the test results \nobtained from Table 6 and 7 it is confirmed that \ntransformer oil spectral re sponse tends to change \nfor various levels of contaminations and \ndegradation level. For pure transformer oil when \nsubjected to thermal degradation test, the wave \nlength lies between 2 00 to 300 nm and the \nabsorption peak varies based on the level of \nthermal degradation. For oil with Kraft paper and \npress board during measurement of absorption \npeak the wave length lies between 357-372 nm. \nFrom the results obtained it is clearly established \nthat bandwidth and absorption capability of \ntransformer oil changes for various level of \nheating. \n \n     Volume resistivity \n          Loss factor \n \n BDV (kV) \n        Loss factor \n \nBDV (kV) \n        Volume resistivity Ω-cm \nFigure 3.

Variation of Absorption peak to hours of heating of \nsamples.  \nAbsorption and bandwidth value differ for \nincrease of contaminants, pure oil has lesser \nwavelength since it absorbs light in small quantity. \nFrom the Figure 4 it is observed that absorption \npeak of transformer oil with Kraft and pressboard is \nhigher than pure oil, since the insulation materials \nabsorbs more UV light than the pure oil. Whenever \ncontaminants increases, UV-visible light take \nadditional time to penetrate the sample, hence \nwavelength value also increases. It can be predictable \nthat by knowing the exact peak absorption of oil \nwith range of particular bandwidth confirms the \npresence of furan derivatives dissolved in oil due to \nsolid insulation deterioration. UV test is not a \nmandatory test as per standards, but based on more \nnumber of experimental results obtained with \nvarious levels of degradation, an index value of \nabsorption peak with their corresponding bandwidth \ncan be formed. Based on the index values we can \ndetermine the level of contaminants\n. \nConclusion \nExperimental investigations have been carried \nout on transformer oil with various levels of \ndegradations to study its characteristics changes. \nCritical parameters of oil is analysed for various level \nof thermal degradation with combinations of \ninsulation materials. Aging characteristics analyses of \ntransformer oil using spectral response gives some \nidea towards level of degradation. Correlations \namong the electrical characteristics were examined \nand the results were inferred. Effective condition \nmonitoring of transformer oil surely paves way for \nincreased life time of insulation, as a result surprised \nfailure and forced outages shall be minimized. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors like to thank Department of Science \nand Technology (DST), Ministry of Science and \nTechnology, Government of India for funding the \nproject to do this research work on “Investigations \nof critical electrical char acteristics and UV response \nof transformer oil for optimized functions of Power \ntransformer” under Fast track Young Scientists \nScheme (SR/FTP/ETA-49/2010). \nReferences  \nASTM-American Society of Testing and Materials. \nASTM D 3828 - Standard test methods for determining \nFlash Point - Fire point for oil.
