Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-020-00045-1\nBackground\nEffective clinical handover is fundamental to clinical prac-\ntice and is recognised as a local [ 1], national [ 2], and global\n[3] quality and safety priority. Ineffective clinical handover\nincreases the risk of patient-related errors as a result of\npoor communication and the lack of appropriate and\ntimely transfer of critical info rmation at the time of report-\ning. This creates inefficiencies in clinical practice leading to\nsuboptimal patient care [ 2]. This is especially problematic\nat transitions of care, such as transfer from the ED to the\nward, when communication errors are more likely and\nthere is an increased risk of in formation being miscommu-\nnicated or lost. Ineffective co mmunication at clinical hand-\nover is also associated with clinicians spending extensive\ntime attempting to retrieve relevant and correct informa-\ntion [4]. This can result in inappropriate care, and the pos-\nsibility of misuse or poor use of resources [ 5]. There\nremain multiple barriers to effective handover including a\nlack of systematic structure, including incomplete hand-\novers, excessive reliance on memory without reference to\nwritten documentation and poor quality of written medical\nrecords [6]. These barriers are part icularly prevalent in the\ncomplex and hectic emergenc y department (ED) context\nwhere more than 2.5 million ED to ward clinical handovers\noccur in Australian hospitals each year [ 7], and the work\npattern is unpredictable making delivery of safe patient\nhandover challenging [ 8]. Responses to this have included\nrecommendations to standardise the structure of handover\ncommunication [ 9]a n di n c l u d et h ep a t i e n ta n dt h e i r\ncarers in the handover [ 2]. An effective standardised\nand structured clinical handover process enhances the\nreliability of information transfer by decreasing the\nreliance on memory and maintaining a focus on im-\nportant aspects of care [ 10]. All relevant participants\nknow the minimum information that needs to be\ncommunicated when handovers take place, the pur-\npose of the handover, the structured format to aid\ncommunication, and how responsibility and account-\nability are transferred. Furt her, critical information is\nmore likely to be accurately transferred and acted on.\nStandardised and structured clinical handover results\nin greater levels of patient satisfaction [ 11], better un-\nderstanding of diagnosis and treatment [ 12], and re-\nduced errors [ 6, 13].\nThe clinical handover from the ED to inpatient ward\nacross four hospitals in the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local\nHealth District (ISLHD) was identified by incident man-\nagement system reports to be inadequate. The clinical\nhandover practice was not meeting key criteria of the local\nMinistry of Health policy Clinical Handover [ 1], particu-\nlarly the requirement of a standardised process as different\ngroups of clinicians were requiring different information\nresulting in varying quality of the information provided.\nThis coincided with a number of reportable clinical inci-\ndents, and subsequent recommendations to improve the\nstandard of ED to ward clinical handover practices.\nTo address this policy — practice gap, an ED to in-\npatient ward clinical handover tool (EDWHAT), was de-\nveloped to comply with the Ministry of Health Clinical\nHandover policy and for the use in the digital platform\nused by the ISLHD (Fig. 1). EDWHAT was developed by\nan ED and ward nurse educator and nurse manager. The\ntool was reviewed by a small group of senior nurses and\nthen implemented at all four hospital sites by local nurse\neducators using face to face education. A formal strategy\nwas not developed. A local audit following the imple-\nmentation of EDWHAT demonstrated that uptake of\nthe tool was mixed between sites and wards. Compliance\nat the different sites ranged from 45 to 90% (mean\n70.1%). The proposed research will determine the facili-\ntators and barriers to the use of this newly implemented\nclinical handover tool by nursing staff at the study sites.\nBehaviour change theory will then be used to develop in-\nterventions to improve the target behaviour, that is, the\nuse of the clinical handover tool.\nMethods\nThis exploratory convergent mixed-method study [ 14]\nwas designed using French et al. ’s four-step implementa-\ntion process model [ 15]; (a) clarifying who needs to do\nwhat differently (nursing staff), (b) identifying barriers and\nenablers (electronic survey of nursing staff, informed by\nthe Theoretical Domains Framework), (c) selecting fit-for-\npurpose intervention strategies and components (mapping\nsurvey results using the behaviour change wheel) and (d)\nevaluating implementation interventions (comparing the\noriginal implementation with the findings of this study).\nThe study process is outlined in Fig. 2. The study was con-\nducted in a Local Health District (LHD) which has four\ngeographically and casemix diverse EDs (rural, regional,\nmetropolitan).

Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 3 of 14\nAustralian National Health and Medical Research Council\nand was approved by the University of Wollongong\n(UOW) and ISLHD Health and Medical Human Research\nEthics Committee (LNR/18/WGONG/148).\nPhase 1: staff survey\nInstrument\nThe electronic survey was administered via REDCap\n(Research Data Capture), a secure Web-based applica-\ntion for data management and survey tool. The survey\ncommenced with participant characteristics such as age,\nplace of work (ward or ED) and level of experience. This\nwas followed by 11 questions focussed on known bar-\nriers and enablers to uptake of new tools in the clinical\nenvironment generally [ 2] and specific to the study site\n[16, 17] that were then mapped to the domains of the\nTheoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The TDF is a\nsynthesis of behavioural change theories presented as a\nframework to explore the science of intervention imple-\nmentation in health care [ 18]. The TDF was selected to\ninform the survey to enable targeted questions related to\npractice within the clinical environment, classification of\nenablers and barriers using a broad range behavioural\ninfluences, as the investigators had previously success-\nfully used the TDF to identify and design interventions\nin the ED/acute care context [ 16, 17, 19]. Each of the\nkey influences on behaviour are listed in Table 1. The\ninformation gathered from the survey assisted in identi-\nfying the main factors influencing behaviour change in\nthe clinical setting. Most questions had a 5-point Likert\nresponse, with the opportunity for free text/comment.\nThe survey can be found in Additional file 2.\nParticipant recruitment and procedure\nEligible participants were registered or enrolled nurses,\nwho as part of their role would be involved in the giving\nor receiving of handover on patients being transferred\nfrom an ISLHD ED to a participating inpatient unit\nwithin the ISLHD. Maternity and mental health units\nwere excluded as at the time of the study, they did not\nuse the handover tool. There were approximately 3000\nnurses across ISLHD eligible to complete the survey.\nThe study was conducted over a 5-month period from\nNovember 2018 to March 2019. The data collection\nperiod was extended due to delays in distribution and the\nChristmas holiday period. Participants were emailed the\nsurvey link and a participant information sheet to their\nNSW Health staff email address via their managers. Time\nto complete the survey was allocated during education\nand other downtimes. Reminders were sent fortnightly.\nData analysis\nQuantitative survey data were analysed using descriptive\nstatistics. Preliminary analyses were run to check for\nmissing data. Responses were presented as proportional\ndata. Sub-analyses were conducted to identify specific\nbarriers or facilitators by site, and/or by ward or ED lo-\ncation. Qualitative data from the free-text responses\nwere analysed using inductive thematic analysis using\nBraun and Clark ’s 6-step process [ 21]. The responses\nwere read through several times to get a sense of the\ndata and allocated into thematic areas [ 22]. The meaning\nunits were developed by condensing the text. Meaning\nunits were classified into themes and sub-themes. This\nprocess was completed by two authors (KR and KC).\nFig. 2 Convergent mixed methods study informed by behaviour change theory\nCurtis et al. Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 4 of 14\nPhase 2: identification of facilitators and barriers and data\nintegration\nQuantitative items were considered facilitators if they\nwere positively worded with greater or equal to 70%\nagreement with a statement. Items were considered bar-\nriers if they were positively worded with less than 70%\nagreement with a statement [ 23, 24]. Qualitative themes\nwere considered facilitators or barriers based on the lit-\nerature, and/or positively or negatively worded state-\nment. The quantitative and qualitative results were then\nmapped to each of the TDF domains by two authors\n(KR and KC). Each item was reviewed to identify poten-\ntial facilitators and barriers to implementation in each\ndomain. If it was unclear if an item (survey response or\ntheme) was a facilitator or barrier for the implementa-\ntion, then the consensus was sought from a senior mem-\nber of the study team with experience in the use of the\nTDF (BM). For any items that crossed multiple domains,\nfor ease of presentation, we selected the domain we felt\nmost represented the item. However, if the secondary\ndomain was not identified in any other items, we allo-\ncated that domain to prevent the omission of any rele-\nvant domains. Sub-analyses (cross-tabulation) of\nenablers and barriers were conducted to determine if\nthere were any findings specific to the type of nurse (ED\nor ward) or hospital site.\nPhase 3: development of implementation strategies\nThe facilitators and barriers from the survey were then\nmapped to intervention functions and behaviour change\ntechniques guided by the Behaviour Change Wheel [ 25].\nFirstly, the authors mapped the TDF domains identified\nin phase 2 to intervention functions. Intervention func-\ntions are “broad categories by means of which an inter-\nvention can change behaviour ”. Each intervention\nfunction was assessed to see if they were Affordable,\nPractical, Effective, Acceptable, had Side-effects and\nwere safe and Equitable (APEASE criteria) [ 25], and\nprioritised [ 26]. Stakeholders (front line nurses, nurse\nmanagers, nurse educators) were involved in the assess-\nment of intervention functions during a series of meet-\nings where the initial concept was tabled at various\ndepartmental meetings to garner support for the inter-\nvention. Secondly, the authors chose behaviour change\ntechniques (BCTs) from the Behaviour Change Tech-\nnique Taxonomy (BCTTv1) based on the intervention\nfunctions. A BCT is a component of an intervention that\nwill alter behaviour [ 25]. The taxonomy includes 93\ntechniques for behaviour change linked to the Behaviour\nChange Wheel. Each intervention function is associated\nwith a list of BCTs that are relevant to that intervention\nfunction, which can be assessed for relevancy to the local\ncontext. For example, if the barriers and facilitators dif-\nfered between the ward and emergency nurses, the inter-\nvention function and supporting BCTs were refined to\nthat context. Each BCT was also assessed using the\nAPEASE criteria for inclusion alongside the intervention\nfunctions. The resulting BCTs were collated and used as\nsuggested techniques to support the selected modes of\ndelivery specific to the context of the sites (wards vs\nEDs, or particular sites). The TDF domains were\ngrouped using COM-B then developed to a logic map.\nResults\nParticipant characteristics\nOf the 300 nurses (approximate10% response rate from\nthe whole of ISLHD) involved in the study, 80.41% were\nbetween 20 and 50 years of age, with just over one third\n(33.89%) between six and 15 years of experience. The re-\nsponses were proportionally representative of the size of\neach site. Just over half of respondents were ward nurses\n(56.7%) (Table 2).\nTable 1 The 14 behavioural influences of the Theoretical\nDomains Framework [ 20]\nDomains included in the survey are italicised\n1.

Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 5 of 14\nReasons for not using the EDWHAT\nThe most common reasons for not using EDWHAT\nwere uniform across nurse type and hospital site. How-\never, within each reason, there was some variance. For\nexample, the most frequently cited reason for not using\nthe tool was the inability to locate a computer near a\nphone (44%, n = 121, but more so in the ward 47%, n =\n65), being told to transfer the patient before being able\nto complete the form (particularly in ED 52.10%, n =\n62), the other nurse receiving (or giving) the handover\nnot using the form (38.83%, n = 106) and not having\ntime (34%, n = 94) (Fig. 3). More than half of nurses\nfrom the two sites with the poorest uptake felt the tool\ndid not support timely (60%, n = 75; 55%, n = 50) or\neasy handover (54%, n = 68 and 54%, n = 49). These two\nsites also had the largest proportions of nurses that re-\nported being told to transfer the patient before being\nable to complete the form (33%, n = 42 and 55%, n =\n50). The site who had the highest uptake also had the\nhighest proportion of nurses reporting the tool was im-\nportant (76%, n = 38).\nQuantitative results presented within the corresponding\nbehavioural domains\nKnowledge\nKnowing where to locate the tool proved a facilitator to\nusing the tool, with 91.26% ( n = 261) of staff across all\nnursing types knowing where to locate the tool. All of the\nnurses in the ED knew where to locate the tool, whereas a\nsmall portion of ward nurses did not (16%, n =2 4 ) .\nSkills\nThe majority of nurses (78.25%, n = 223) indicated they\nhad a good understanding of how to use the tool. Some\nward nurses however had little (23.13%, n = 34) or no\n(8.16%, n = 12) understanding of how to fill out the tool,\nwhich was considered a barrier.\nEnvironment\nEnvironmental influences were a substantial barrier. The\nmost frequently reported factor that hindered nurses\nfrom using the tool was the inability to access a phone\nnear a computer (44.32%, n = 121).\nBeliefs about capabilities\nThe majority of respondents reported they felt confident\nusing the tool (77.39%, n = 219). However, more ward\nnurses reported not feeling confident with using the tool\n(33.10%, n = 48) compared to ED nurses (9.92%, n = 12).\nOverall, 68.27% ( n = 185) of nurses agreed that the tool\nwas easy to use. Within the ED setting, ease of use was a\nfacilitator (78.99%, n = 94), whereas this was a barrier\nfor ward nurses (60.74%, n = 82) and nurses who work\nin both contexts (52.94%, n = 9).\nBeliefs about consequences\nBeliefs about consequences were one of the largest bar-\nriers to use of the tool, as just over half of the respon-\ndents considering the tool important (59.30%), in\nparticular those aged over 51 years. The age group with\nthe largest proportion reporting that the tool was not\nimportant was the 31 –40-year group (46.27%). There\nwas a little difference between ED and ward nurses re-\ngarding the importance (59.86% and 57.85%) or how\nlong nurses had been working. The information commu-\nnicated within the tool was also a substantial barrier as\nnearly half of respondents felt it was inadequate to en-\nsure safe handover (45.79%, n = 125). The majority of\nnurses considered the tool did not promote timely hand-\nover (54.91%, n = 151) or make the handover process\neasier (50.91%, n = 140). These beliefs trends are the\nsame between nurses who work on the wards, in the ED,\nand who do both.\nTable 2 Characteristics of nursing respondents\nParticipant characteristic Number (%) ( N = 301)\nHospital location*\nWollongong Hospital (WH) 142 (47.3)\nShoalhaven District Memorial Hospital (SDMH) 96 (32.0)\nShellharbour Hospital (SHH) 51 (17.0)\nMilton Ulladulla Hospital (MUH) 11 (3.7)\nNurse type*\nWard 158 (56.7)\nED 123 (41.0)\nBoth 19 (6.3)\nAge group\n< 20 years 1 (0.3)\n20–30 years 77 (25.6)\n31–40 years 86 (28.6)\n41–50 years 70 (23.3)\n51–60 years 57 (18.9)\n61–70 years 10 (3.3)\n> 70 years 0 (0.0)\nYears of experience\n< 5 years 81 (26.9)\n6–10 yrs 50 (16.6)\n11–15 years 52 (17.3)\n16–20 years 24 (8.0)\n21–25 years 38 (12.6)\n26–30 years 25 (8.3)\n> 30 years 31 (10.3)\n*n = 300\nCurtis et al. Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 6 of 14\nMemory\nOverall, finding the tool easy to remember to use was a\nfacilitator (83.15%, n = 232). However, this trend differed\nbetween nurse types, with this being a barrier for ward\nnurses (51.05%, n = 73) in contrast to ED nurses\n(81.51%, n = 97). The greatest factor for remembering to\nuse the tool is having time to prepare for the handover\n(52%), which is similar between nurse types. In contrast,\nthe factor contributing the least to remembering to use\nthe tool is being reminded by a manager (6%) (Fig. 4).\nQualitative results\nThere were 399 free-text comments, resulting in 31\nthemes representing 22 barriers and nine facilitators\n(Table 3). These mapped to eight of the 14 TDF do-\nmains (Table 3). The most barriers were related to the\nenvironment in which the tool is required to be used,\nthe content and usability of the form, and beliefs about\nthe benefits (or lack thereof), particularly in relation to\nsocial influence. The most problematic behavioural in-\nfluence was the environment with four sub-themes.\nFirstly, the functionality of the form within the elec-\ntronic medical record system. This highlighted the tech-\nnical difficulties of having the information in a “form”\ntemplate within the electronic medical record, which\nmeans it cannot be minimised or open and shut, without\nlosing information, to view other areas of the patient\nchart. Encapsulated by these respondents;\n“Issue is that once in the tool you cannot revisit\nyour notes which is a problem because you miss\nvital information ”(ED nurse 16)\n“Access to the form should be instant as ED/ward\nare very busy. Access to the handover form depends\non computer availability, staff login time and form\nloading time, for a busy ward and at ED the wait is\ntoo long. Also some ED Nurses are happy to wait\nfor form to be accessed, some ensure you hear their\ndispleasure with sighs or statements of being too\nbusy to wait. ”(Ward nurse 301)\n“…The form is hard to access, through 3 menu ’s…”\n(Ward nurse 222)\nSecondly, there were a number of responses related to\nthe lack of phones and computers which impacted on\nstaff ability to use the form to handover. For example,\n“The only reason to not fill the form out is access to\ncomputers/ telephones ”(ED nurse 204)\nand;\n“there have been times where all the computers\nhave been used and there is no other option than to\nwrite on a piece of paper … .buy more computers ”\n(Ward nurse 78)\nFig. 3 Factors that hinder nurses from using the EDWHAT by nurse type\nCurtis et al. Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 7 of 14\nThe third sub-theme identified concerns related to the\nstructure of the form. The form has limited free-text sec-\ntions, some auto-populated in formation, with the majority\nof information being tick boxes. A number of comments are\nrelated to the content of the form itself; however, this was\noften contradictory. For example, these respondents stated;\n“I believe that the section where you tick that their\nobs are btf is important to ensure safe transfer as\nwell as outstanding actions to ensure there is a rec-\nord of what still needs to be done for the patient ”\n(ED nurse 17)\n“It is easy to use however it is useless as it does not\nprovide enough information and the other staff\nmember becomes complacent and just wants to tick\nboxes”(ED nurse 158)\nAnd in contrast;\n“sometimes important information is lost or import-\nance negated by the volume of information asked for\nand given. often questions are mechanically asked\nwith nil active listening involved …” (ED nurse 24)\n“…Some nurses will ask all the questions in the tool\nand then they go to hang up, and you have to promt\nthem and say ' do you wan tto know what i have done\nsince they have been here now? ’”(ED nurse 249)\nThe other frequently reported domains were beliefs\nabout consequences and social roles and influences.\nWithin these domains, staff reported feeling that the tool\nwas useful in helping important patient safety informa-\ntion gets handed over and improving the patient con-\ntinuity of care and the patient experience;\n“The tool is useful in ensuring a holistic handover is\ncovered”(ED nurse 204)\nHowever, responses also highlighted a number of beliefs\nheld by the nurse sending the patient (ED) and the nurse\nreceiving the patient (ward) about the handover. These\nbeliefs seem to indicate conflict which may have been\npresent prior to the introduction of the form. This may in-\ndicate differences in the working environments of emer-\ngency departments and wards who have different\nfunctions and responsibilities. Responses from ward staff\nsuggest a lack of knowledge about the patient by ED staff;\n“most of the time handover was wrong and wasting\ntime filling the form ”(Ward nurse 280)\nand;\n“…The ED nurses most of the time do not know\nenough information about the patients to be able to\ncomplete all the questions, as they are taking over\nfrom another nurse who cared for that patient previ-\nously or it is another nurse bringing the patient to the\nward. A telephone handover from the nurse who is\ncaring for the patient, so I can access my computer\nand they can access their computer to complete the\nform and then the ward nurse collects the patient or\nFig. 4 Factors that make it easier to remember to use the EDWHAT by ward vs ED\nCurtis et al. Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 8 of 14\nthe ED nurse brings the pateint down would be\nMORE EFFECTIVE.”(Ward nurse 222)\nConversely, the ED nurse respondents felt the ward\nstaff are focused on tasks and not the patient\ncondition;\n“Often ward nurses want to skip the brief hand-\nover (2 minutes). I would usually provide that\ntells them why the patient presented, what we've\ndone and the plan. They only want to hear the\nanswers to the questions prompted by the form ”\n(ED nurse 97)\nWithin these themes, time pressure was raised as a\nstrong influence on the ability to adequately handover,\n“Being told to hurry a handover does not respect\nthe value of handover ”(Ward nurse 10)\nand;\n“I don't have any objection to using the handover\nform. However I have found time constraints some-\ntimes prevent me using it. Also at times we are di-\nrected to transfer the patient prior to having\nhandover”(Ward nurse 81)\nTable 3 The 32 themes identified that facilitate or hinder the use of the EDWHAT in the ISLHD\nBarriers TDF domain\nNot supported by manager to complete handover Reinforcement\nNot being face to face for handover means things get missed Beliefs about consequences\nDoesn't make a difference to the handover I get Beliefs about consequences\nED staff don't use properly and don't like using it Social influence\nWard staff don't want to use it Social influence\nCan't click out of the from to other part of the notes Environment\nDuplication of processes Environment\nResults in a focus on tick boxes and not the whole patient story Environment\nIrrelevant content within the form Environment\nCumbersome Environment\nDifficult to locate form in eMR Environment\nTime restrictions — it takes too long Environment\nPt in transfer before hand over starts Environment\nUnavailability or difficult location of computer Environment\nStructure/flow is not intuitive Environment\nMore information is required than listed in the form Environment\nTime pressure to move patients does not support handover Environment\nHard to remember to use Memory\nUsefulness is user dependent Skills\nMinimal use means unfamiliarity Skills\nHas to be mutual agreement between ward and ED to complete Social/professional role\nED don't know their patient Social influences\nFacilitators\nEnsures completion of tasks Beliefs about consequences\nImportant for patient safety Optimism\nImproves communication between ED and ward Beliefs about consequences\nImproves continuity of care Beliefs about consequences\nProvides evidence of handover Beliefs about consequences\nGood systematic tool that ensures everything completed Beliefs about consequences\nPrompts identification of issues Beliefs about consequences\nPrompts sharing of the information needed for handover Beliefs about consequences\nIt's just part of what we do Social/professional role\nCurtis et al.

It can vary from thorough, to vague,\nto someone who doesn't know the patient. An expe-\nrienced clinician knows the questions to ask, a nov-\nice clinician may take all information on face value ”\n(Ward nurse 36)\nPhase 3: development of implementation strategies\nThe TDF domains identified in phase 2 were mapped to\nthe nine corresponding intervention functions (Table 4).\nEach intervention function [ 27] and selected BCT [ 28]\nwas assessed using the APEASE criteria. Seven of the\nnine intervention functions and 18 BCTs were consid-\nered appropriate for use in future implementation, and\nthe commentary from key stakeholders regarding each\nintervention function is listed in Table 4.\nThe agreed-upon BCTs were collated and were used\nto develop implementation strategies (modes of delivery)\nspecific to the context of the sites (wards vs EDs, or par-\nticular sites). These were then developed into a logic\nmap (Fig. 5). The logic map demonstrates the mapping\nprocess and selection of BCTs to inform the strategy to\nimprove uptake of the EDWHAT. Filled boxes or par-\ntially filled boxes in the recommendation column repre-\nsent interventions/BCTs that were completed or\npartially completed in the original implementation. An\nimplementation checklist for future use was developed\nbased on the behavioural influences most prominent in\nthe survey responses and themes, the intervention func-\ntions selected through the APEASE process and gaps\nhighlighted by the logic map (Fig. 6).\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated the numerous barriers and fa-\ncilitators to uptake of a new intervention designed to im-\nprove ED to Ward Handover across a local health\ndistrict, in particular, the influence of the working envir-\nonment, social influence and beliefs about consequences.\nImplementation of new interventions needs planning\nand strategy that address the complexity of healthcare\nsystems and individual practitioners [ 29] and strong or-\nganisational support [ 30]. There are multiple models\navailable on which to develop and plan an implementa-\ntion strategy [ 31], the most well known in health is\nFig. 5 Logic map demonstrating the mapping process and selection of BCTs to inform the strategy to improve uptake of the ED to Ward\nHandover Tool. *Filled boxes or partially filled boxes in the recommendations column represent BCTs that were completed or partially completed\nin the original implementation\nCurtis et al. Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 11 of 14\nperhaps the Promoting Action on Research Implementa-\ntion in Health Services Framework or PARIHS Frame-\nwork [ 32]; however, human behaviour, which is central\nto the sustainable success of any change, must also be\nincorporated. Using a systematic four-step approach as\nthe principal framework to inform intervention develop-\nment process such as that proposed by French et al. [ 15]\nis ideal and is known to be effective in the acute care\ncontext [ 19]. Colquhoun et al. ’s[ 33] systematic review of\npapers focussing on methods for designing interventions\nto change health care professionals ’behaviour reported\nthat designing an intervention for individual-level\nchange includes identifying barriers, selecting interven-\ntion components, using theory and engaging end-users.\nDeveloping interventions systematically based on evi-\ndence and theory enhances implementation success and\nsustainable worthwhile effect. Further, clear presentation\nof the methods of theory use progresses theory develop-\nment by helping to understand why interventions have\nfailed or succeeded [ 34].\nAll intervention functions, with the exception of envir-\nonmental restructuring and financial incentives, were\nFig. 6 Implementation checklist\nCurtis et al. Implementation Science Communications            (2020) 1:71 Page 12 of 14\nassessed as affordable and practical within existing roles\nand orientation processes. Environmental restructuring\nwas ranked as one of the most important interventions\nrequired, and while some investment will be required,\nthe majority can be achieved with existing IT and senior\nnursing staff roles. Additional computers are not an\nonerous budget item and a priority. When operationalis-\ning the reinforcement and persuasive interventions, par-\nticular care must be taken to ensure an equitable\napproach to all staff to ensure no staff feel “singled out ”\nand the intervention is not misconstrued as too authori-\ntarian. A transformational leadership approach is pre-\nferred [ 35]. The success of the interventions would also\nbe enhanced by nursing staff from different areas having\na shared mental model, that is, a common understanding\nof the task (handover process) and the clinical and logis-\ntical needs to conduct handover for their colleague [ 36].\nIt would also ensure that nursing staff from different\nareas of the hospital are familiar with one another ’s roles\nand responsibilities, could anticipate each other ’s needs\nand be flexible [ 37].\nIn relation to education as a method to influence\nchange, the excessive educational focus may lead to neg-\nlect in other domains and in isolation is unlikely to be\neffective in increasing uptake of the EDWHAT [ 38].\nThis is reinforced by the fact that education was the\nmain intervention in initial implementation that had\nsuboptimal uptake. The study process also highlights the\nimportance of using a structured, evidence-informed\nprocess to diagnose implementation problems and solu-\ntions that are likely acceptable and practical to the or-\nganisation to enable success. This is demonstrated in the\nlogic map (Fig. 5). The initial implementation of the\nEDWHAT partially considered only three aspects of hu-\nman behaviour (knowledge, skills and beliefs about cap-\nability). The poor uptake of the tool is a clear indication\nthat for interventions to success in the clinical environ-\nment, influences on human behaviour must be ad-\ndressed. A re-implementation strategy is now under\nconsideration by the organisation; however, it must be\nadequately resourced and take into consideration the\nfindings of this study for optimal implementation. It will\nbe necessary to evaluate the re-implementation of the\ntool in the future.\nLimitations\nThere were some limitations to this study. Firstly, the\nsurvey response rate was much lower than expected\n(10%) despite allowing time during work hours to\ncomplete the survey, although data saturation was\nreached. The overall estimate of staff obtained from de-\npartmental managers included part-time, casual and vis-\niting staff, as well as those on maternity, annual and\nlong service leave which may have exaggerated the\nactual numbers of staff available to participate. Staff\nfrom all departments and levels of seniority completed\nthe survey, resulting in a representative sample.\nThe theoretical frameworks provided a systematic\nmethod for the identification of facilitators and barriers;\nhowever, our experience was of crossover between do-\nmains. These were resolved with a discussion between\nthe authors. The authors agreed to categorise barriers or\nfacilitators in one domain over another to aide in the in-\ntegration and interpretation of the results while appreci-\nating the potential interaction between TDF domains.\nConclusions\nTo improve uptake, the functionality, content, and flow of\nthe handover tool must be revised, alongside environmen-\ntal restructuring. Modelling and enabling of effective\nhandover by nursing management is also required. Nurses\nneed increased awareness of each other ’s needs to develop\na shared mental model, and monitoring and enforcement\nof tool use should become part of a routine audit.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.\n1186/s43058-020-00045-1.\nAdditional file 1.
