    "abstract": "Information and communication technologies are opening up vast new arenas for conducting the work of health promotion. Technology-based health promotions expand reach, standardize information and its delivery, provide opportunities for tailoring, create engaging interactivity within content delivery, provide for privacy and autonomy, improve portability, and lower delivery costs. This commentary describes the ongoing exploration and development of a web-based tool for enhancing the reach and impact of photovoice as a community change intervention. Features of the tool use information and communication technologies that integrate the use of an online learning management system, tailored messaging, gaming technology, interactive features, and the application of social media's power to increase the capacity of communities to employ comprehensive strategies to improve the health of their communities. It will enable individuals and groups to use photos and captions to assess the physical environment, social norms and behaviors of communities; raise community awareness of the factors contributing to ill-health in their communities, mobilize stakeholders, and inform environmental strategies and policy changes. We believe it will enhance the delivery of educational content about conducting photovoice projects, provide features unavailable without the application of information and communication technologies, and will be substantive advancement over existing photovoice resources.",
