INTRODUCTION\nDegradation of transformer oils can cause a failure. This\nfailure can put transformers out of service and could cause\non them severe damages due to lack of insulation [1]. Each\nturn of transformer windings has one or more thin sheets of\nKraft paper as its insulation that is, basically, cellulose [2].\nMoisture content in insulation oil can have several adverse\neffects such as a reduction in dielectric strength. This mois-\nture can originate through transformer breathing or cellu-\nlose decomposition. In addition, moisture content accelerates\npaper degradation [3]. Besides, it contributes to lower the\ntemperature at which, bubbles form [4]. It is well known that\nbubbles give rise to partial discharges.\nDuring the operating life of a transformer, its windings,\nand more speciﬁcally, its insulation have to withstand high\nmechanical, thermal and chemical stresses [5]. This causes\nthe aging of the insulation that degrades and adds water to\ntransformer oil [6]. This water adds to the water that enters\nthrough the vents used for transformer breathing [7].\nDissolution of water in oil is a problem because it acceler-\nates insulation degradation. It also has a harmful action over\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Paolo Giangrande\n.\noil dielectric strength and decreases the maximum voltage\nthat a transformer can withstand without being damaged [8].\nWater presence in transformer oils is measured in parts\nper million (ppm) and must not exceed 35 ppm [9]. If that\nlimit is exceeded, corrective actions should be taken. Among\nthem, oil drying processes can be applied before the insula-\ntion ages severely or in more serious cases, the oil must be\nreplaced [10], [11].\nIn this article, a new sensor and measurement method of\nmoisture content is presented. It is based on introducing a\ncapacitor inside the transformer tank and analyzing its fre-\nquency response with a Frequency Response Analysis (FRA)\ndevice. The sensor should be submerged in the transformer\noil, away from high-voltage areas. As oil moisture content\nis temperature dependent [12], oil temperature should be\nmeasured as well.\nCurrent FRA test results, from an oil sample, are compared\nwith a set of reference, same oil FRA tests made with different\nmoisture content at the test temperature. From this compari-\nson, the sample oil moisture content can be determined.\nThis information could contribute to estimate insulation\nstate and could help other studies to calculate the remaining\nlife of a transformer, as it is done with other components\nand techniques [13], [14]. Furthermore, it improves actual\n7576 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ.

Section IV presents the computer simulations while\nSection V includes the laboratory test results to corrobo-\nrate the proper operation of the method. Finally, Section VI\npresents conclusions, main contribution of the paper and\nfuture lines of research.\nII. STATE OF THE ART\nThe disadvantages of degradation and loss of insulation in\npower transformers have been known for decades. As previ-\nously stated, water concentration in transformer oil is a good\nestimator of cellulose degradation and, therefore, of insula-\ntion aging. This knowledge helps to avoid possible trans-\nformer failures. For this reason, several techniques have been\nused. Most of them are based on extraction of samples that are\nsubsequently taken to a laboratory for their analysis. From the\nresults of these analyses, appropriate measures are applied.\nAmong the techniques of measuring water in transformer\noil, the Karl Fisher Titration Technique stands out as the\nmost used. There are several variants of this technique; all\nbased on the addition of a known concentration of a chemical\nagent iodized in the sample to determine the amount of water\nby means of a stoichiometric equation. Due to the difﬁculty\nof measuring minimal amounts of water dissolved in the\nsample, it is usually heated to separate steam from oil and\nits impurities in order to improve its sensitivity [15].\nIn new oils, different measurement techniques have consid-\nerable deviations among them. Moreover, for aged oils these\ndeviations increase [16].\nSamples are extracted from the transformer tank using\na syringe. Then, they are carried to a laboratory for anal-\nysis. These processes have an inherent risk of sample\ncontamination.\nOther methods, such as furfuraldehyde analysis (FFA),\ncontemplate on-site tests for cellulose degradation and deco-\nmposition in water. Using spectroscopic methods installed\nin transformer windings, and measuring wavelengths with\nan optical sensor, furfuraldehyde concentration can be cal-\nculated [17]. Therefore, cellulose degradation state can be\nestimated.\nAnother method for assessing the concentration of water\nin transformer oils is through equilibrium diagrams. They are\nbased on the principle that the moisture in the oil is the same\nas the moisture in the insulation as long as equilibrium at a\nconstant temperature is reached [18].\nThis technique is similar to the Karl Fisher Titration Tech-\nnique, but with an additional step in order to directly deter-\nminate the moisture in the winding insulation (Fig. 1).\nThe procedure is based on the extraction of an oil sample.\nIts water concentration is analyzed and, through the equilib-\nrium diagrams, the moisture in the cellulose is obtained.\nFIGURE 1. Theoretical Karl Fisher diagram with different oil operating\ntemperatures.\nThese equilibrium diagrams confront on one axis the mois-\nture content in the cellulose and on the other axis the moisture\ncontent in the oil (Fig. 1). Several curves, obtained over the\nyears through experimentation with various types of materials\nand at different temperatures, are inside the diagram. There-\nfore, after obtaining moisture in oil, by regression, moisture\nin the insulation can be determined.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 7577\nJ. M. Guerreroet al.: Transformer Oil Diagnosis Based on a Capacitive Sensor FRA\nThis method has additional drawbacks to the Karl Fisher\nTitration Technique. As the sample is analyzed in a labora-\ntory, it has the same potential measurement errors. An addi-\ntional source of uncertainty is that not all winding points are\nat the same temperature, due to non-homogeneous cooling.\nMoreover, the equilibrium in the dissolution of water in oil is\nhardly reached.\nBoth weaknesses violate the fundamental principle of equi-\nlibrium diagrams.\nDue to known errors in moisture measurement in trans-\nformer oils shown by previous techniques, new ideas were\ndeveloped. Among them, Recovery V oltage Method (RVM),\nfocused on measuring the dielectric response of the insulation\nby subjecting it to a DC voltage [19].\nThis technique is based on applying a DC voltage to the\ninsulation and measuring the recovery voltage. First, the insu-\nlation is charged during a certain time. When it is charged,\nit is short-circuited for a brief time span. After clearing the\nshort-circuit, a peak recovery voltage appears (Fig. 2). This\npeak is registered to create a spectrum called ‘‘polarization\nspectrum’’ through several measurement repetitions.\nAnother online operating test uses a portable optical ﬁber\nspectroscopy that measures the degree of polymerization\n(DP) [20].\nAn additional technique used is Frequency Domain Spec-\ntroscopy (FDS). In it, a sample is subjected to a step polariza-\ntion current and its response is Fourier transformed. From it,\ndielectric permittivity and dielectric dissipation factor of the\nsample are calculated [21].\nFinally, there are capacitive sensors that allow an online\nmoisture measurement in oil [22]. They are based on the\nfact that moisture content changes dielectric properties. This\nchange can be detected as a capacitance change. Therefore,\nthey correlate moisture changes to capacitance changes.\nFIGURE 2. A RVM wave evolution during a test.\nHowever, these type of sensors are slow in oil aging\ndetermination because sensor capacitance should reach equi-\nlibrium to determine which is the actual water content\nin oil [23].\nThe FRA technique is commonly used to assess if any\ndeformation on the active parts of a transformer has hap-\npened [24]. Notwithstanding, it has been proposed also\nto examine the aging of transformer insulation with faster\nresults than the FDS method [25]. In this article, the pro-\nposed capacitive sensor response is analyzed using the\nFRA technique combined with a slow forced-convection\nto homogenize the mixture. It should be emphasized that\nsensor capacitance is not a required parameter for taking\nmeasurements.\nIII. OPERATING PRINCIPLES OF THE NEW METHOD\nA capacitive sensor for on-line measurement of moisture\ncontent in power transformer oil has been designed. It is\ncomposed of 24 aluminum plates vertically stacked. They are\n1 mm apart. The whole set is a capacitor. Although some\ntests were made using steel plates, their fast oxidation advises\nchanging the material to aluminum, which has performed\nmuch better during the tests.\nEach aluminum plate is 120 mm high, 30 mm wide and\n2 mm thick. All of them are supported by an upper and lower\nplastic base. In this way, the device has enough stiffness.\nThe whole set will be embedded in a transformer tank. The\ncapacitor is shown in Fig. 3.\nFIGURE 3. 3D design of the plain-parallel capacitor prototype proposed\nin this article as an oil degradation sensor.\nAs it is well-known, the capacitance of a plain-parallel\ncapacitor is deﬁned in (1) as:\nC =(N −1)ε0εr ·S\nd (1)\nAs the device has all its parts ﬁxed, plate’s surface and dis-\ntance between them are constants. N is 24 and ε0 is vacuum\npermittivity (8.854 ·10−12 F ·m−1). Then, the capacitance of\nthis device only depends on the relative dielectric permittivity\nof the material that ﬁlls the space between the plates.\nAs mentioned above, cellulose is the main compound\nof winding insulation. When it degrades, it contaminates\n7578 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. M. Guerreroet al.: Transformer Oil Diagnosis Based on a Capacitive Sensor FRA\nFIGURE 4.

For this reason, inside the transformers there\nis no pure oil. This fact must be considered to estimate the\npermittivity of the ﬂuid that ﬁlls the space between plates in\nthe proposed device.\nTherefore, the relative permittivity of the ﬂuid is a function\nof moisture content. It can be expressed as (2):\nεr =f (X) ·εr oil +g(Y ) ·εr water (2)\nwhere X, Y are fractions of oil and water, respectively, and\nf and g are functions that depends on the compounds’ type\nand the behavior between them. Relative dielectric permittiv-\nity of transformer oil, εroil, is commonly in a range between\n2.1 and 2.4 and although relative dielectric permittivity of\nwater, εrwater , depends on frequency, its value is around\n80 between 0 and 1 MHz [26].\nFluid resistivity of a ﬂuid mixture can be described in the\nsame way (3):\nρm =u(X) ·ρoil +v(Y ) ·ρwater (3)\nwhere oil resistivity, ρoil is around 12 ·1012 ·m [27] and\nwater resistivity, ρwater , is approximately 18 ·104·m [28].\nThe functions u and v also depend on the mixture behavior.\nDuring an oil degradation process, the amount of water in\nparts per million, ppm, increases, so the oil volume fraction\nX decreases and the water molar fraction, Y , increases.\nBecause water dielectric permittivity is larger than oil\npermittivity, oil degradation increases the medium relative\npermittivity and therefore the capacitance of the device\naccording to (1).\nNew oil has constant resistivity and permittivity. How-\never, as degradation progresses, permittivity and capacitance\nincrease while resistivity and impedance decrease. All these\nchanges can be detected through FRA.\nIn order to carry out the measurements, a FRA device that\nsupplies an alternating current (AC) voltage (U 1) of 1 V RMS\n(root mean square, RMS) at a frequency that varies from\n10 Hz to 20 MHz is used. This equipment measures the output\nvoltage (U2) for each frequency with a voltmeter in parallel to\na 50 impedance (R2). The frequency sweep has 1000 points\nin logarithmic progression.\nFor a better interpretation, the whole system is represented\nschematically in Fig. 4 and maximum frequency operating\nTABLE 2. FRA device main characteristics.\nrange, measuring impedance and accuracies are summed up\nin Table 2.\nConsidering ZC capacitive and representing system voltage\ngain on the y-axis and frequency on the x-axis, this gain is\ndeﬁned as (4):\nA(dB) =20 ·log\n(U2\nU1\n)\n=20 ·log\n\n R2√\nR2\n2 +Z2c\n\n (4)\nInitially, for low frequencies, due to the capacitive behav-\nior of the sensor and good insulation oil’s properties, its\nimpedance is remarkably high. Consequently, the voltage\ndrop is almost entirely in the capacitive sensor causing the\nsystem gain to be minimal. As the frequency increases,\nthe sensor’s impedance decreases. Therefore, the system gain\nalso increases.\nHere, the research focuses on the dual dependence of the\nimpedance variables of the device, being its frequency and\nits capacitance. Both will increase the frequency because the\nsweep is in increasing order, and the capacitance because of\nthe aging oil. A third dependence is also considered: changes\nin the resistivity of the ﬂuid mixture caused by the aging oil.\nThis resistivity will decrease as the amount of water in oil\nincreases.\nAll these parameters imply a continuous reduction of Zc\nas much as the oil becomes aged. For this reason, in order\nto detect oil aging, the research is carried out at different\nfrequencies. Then, the impedance of the device decreases\nand, consequently, the gain increases, expressed, as shown\nearlier (4), as a logarithmic function.\nThe permittivity of this ﬂuid can be estimated as a linear\nregression for small values of water content in oil, according\nto the Lewin’s Formula [29], [30]. This ﬂuid resistivity shows\na logarithmic reduction with the increasing amount of water\nin oil [29]. For this reason, new oils will have the lowest\nvalues of FRA measured gain since they have lower moisture\ncontent. Aged oils, on the contrary, will have the highest gain\nvalues.\nThe capacitive sensor can be installed in a transformer\nfor on-line monitoring. Inside the transformer tank, the elec-\ntric and magnetic ﬁelds may distort the frequency response.\nTherefore, an appropriate location is outside the tank in the\npipe between the transformer’s tank and the oil radiators as\nshown in Fig. 5. Consequently, there are two different pos-\nsibilities, the installation in the upper (A) or lower (B) pipe.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 7579\nJ. M. Guerreroet al.: Transformer Oil Diagnosis Based on a Capacitive Sensor FRA\nFIGURE 5. Possible locations of the capacitive sensor in a transformer for\non-line monitoring: (A) Upper pipe connection and (B) Lower pipe\nconnection. Both between the tank and the radiator.\nIn the upper pipe, the temperature of the oil is higher than\nin the lower connection. This can be positive for moisture\nmeasurement, but the sensor is closer to the high voltage\nterminal, which can be negative as the magnetic and electric\nﬁelds will be greater than in the lower position. As this\nresearch is a proof of concept, the optimum conﬁguration\nshould be determined in a commercial transformer.\nSensor capacitance should be as large as possible to get\nthe best possible sensitivity. For this reason, the number\nof plates must be as large as possible and the distance\nbetween plates as small as possible. However, free section\nbetween plates should be enough to allow oil ﬂowing. For\nthe above reasons, the capacitive sensor is quite big.\nIV. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS\nOnce the method has been deﬁned, some simulations have\nbeen carried out in Matlab R⃝to estimate the behavior of the\nﬂuid mixture.\nTo this aim, a parallel RC circuit, whose parameters are\nfrequency independent, models the device (Fig. 6). The sen-\nsor’s capacitance (C ), through the sensor plates, is calculated\nas (1). In addition, the electric permittivity and dielectric\nresistivity changes have been ﬁtted with the ﬂuid parameter\nvalues shown in Table 3 and data taken from [29]. Then,\nthe following functions have been obtained:\nεr =2.70 ×10−3 ·M(ppm) +2.18 (5)\nρm =−10 9 ·ln(M(ppm)) +2 ×1010 (6)\nFIGURE 6. Simulation setup for measuring oil degradation through FRA.\nAchieving a correlation coefﬁcient (R 2) of 0.7912 and\n0.9318 for (5) and (6), respectively. Once the ﬂuid\ndegradation parameters are deﬁned according to water con-\ntent in oil in ppm (M ) the ﬂuid resistance, Rﬂuid , have been\ncalculated using a well-known relationship shown in (7):\nRﬂuid =ρm ·εr\nC (7)\nThen, both parameters will change when water concentra-\ntion increases according to Equations (5) and (6).\nFig. 7 shows the results of the simulations. The differences\nobserved in simulation results between 0 and 100 ppm are\naround 2 dB in the low frequency range (≈100 Hz).\nFIGURE 7. Capacitor response simulations for water concentrations in oil\nof healthy plus 10, 20, 50 and 100 ppm.\nAccording to the simulation scenery, Table 3 shows the\nvalues of the parameters. Considered water concentrations\nwere healthy oil plus: 10 ppm, 20 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm.\nThe healthy, 10, and 20 ppm are not separate enough\nbetween them (only a few decibel tenths) in comparison to\nconcentration changes of 100 ppm, that can be detected with\nincrements around 2 dB at the same frequencies.\nHowever, water concentration in oil-cooled transform-\ners must be lower than 35 ppm to avoid severe damages.\nThen, the FRA device used should detect slight differences\nin dB to have enough resolution to detect changes in water\nconcentration.\n7580 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. M. Guerreroet al.: Transformer Oil Diagnosis Based on a Capacitive Sensor FRA\nTABLE 3. Simulation setup parameters.\nTo corroborate these results and evaluate if the sensor is\nable to detect these small changes, several tests were made\nusing a commercial FRA measurement device.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY TESTS\nA. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe experimental setup is based on the electrical circuit repre-\nsented in the Fig. 4. The designed capacitive sensor (Fig. 8) is\ndived in a 2 liters recipient full of oil. In order to characterize\nthe oil response, water concentration was increased.\nFIGURE 8. The plain-parallel capacitor prototype proposed as oil\ndegradation sensor.\nInitially, the FRA connections to the equipment are made.\nThe pole 1 of the capacitive sensor was connected to the\nsupply voltage of the FRA test device. On the other hand,\nas shown in Fig. 4, the pole 2 was connected to the output\nFRA signal in order to measure the sensor output voltage.\nOutput voltages are measured by a voltmeter inside\nthe FRA test device at different frequencies. A computer,\nconnected to the FRA test device, records these measure-\nments. In the computer, an application displays the results.\nThe characteristics of the commercial FRA test device used\nin the tests are presented in Table 2.\nAs temperature inﬂuences oil moisture measurements,\na thermostable bath was used to keep the temperature constant\nduring the FRA tests. The temperature was set to 70 ◦C. Slow\nforced-convection was used to ease mixture homogenization.\nFig. 9 depicts the complete experimental setup.\nFIGURE 9. Test setup: (1) FRA equipment, (2) Oil in a recipient, (3) pole\n1 of the capacitor, (4) pole 2 of the capacitor, (5) neutral connection, (6)\nthermostable bath and (7) display of the transfer functions in a computer.\nB. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nExperimental tests are carried out under similar conditions to\nthose that a transformer withstands.\nAs mentioned above, the maximum allowed concentration\nof water in transformer oils is 35 parts per million. For this\nreason, this research focuses on the concentration range from\nlow ppm to such limit, although higher concentrations are\nalso measured and recorded.\nFirst, a reference frequency response characteristic of a\nnew oil is needed. Subsequent responses of this aged oil will\nFIGURE 10. FRA test performed in new oil. Healthy state conditions.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 7581\nJ. M. Guerreroet al.: Transformer Oil Diagnosis Based on a Capacitive Sensor FRA\nFIGURE 11. FRA tests performed in oil with water concentrations from10 ppm to 1000 ppm.\nFIGURE 12. FRA tests performed in oil with water. [(a): Water concentrations 10 ppm to 20 ppm; (b): Water concentrations 20 ppm to 100 ppm].\nbe compared with the reference one. For this purpose, a FRA\nin healthy conditions was done. It is shown in Fig. 10.\nOil degradation is then emulated by adding water. FRA\ntest results were recorded for each water concentration from\nnew oil to 40 ppm with increments of 1 ppm of water\nconcentration.\nLater, the responses are recorded up to 100 ppm concentra-\ntion with 10 ppm increments in water concentration. Finally,\nincrements of 100 ppm are performed between FRA tests\nuntil 1000 ppm are reached.\nFig. 11 presents the results, obtained in the computer\nprogram that displays FRA recorded response. The system\nvoltage gain, expressed in dB, is shown on the Y axis and the\nfrequency is represented on the X axis.\nThere are three zones in these curves. The ﬁrst one appears\nat low frequencies, up to 1 kHz. There, the responses are more\nseparated among them and they show a continuous growing\ngain when water concentration (in ppm) increases. A second\none covers the frequency range from 1 kHz to 2 MHz. Slope\nvaries, but the growing behavior becomes undetermined.\nFinally, the last one starts from 2 MHz until the end of\nthe frequency sweep, 20 MHz. In this zone, the response\nis determined by the FRA connections and not by the oil\nproperties.\nIn Fig. 12, the FRA tests for 10 to 20 ppm and 20 to\n100 ppm in oil can be observed for a frequency window from\n20 Hz to 10 kHz. These ﬁgures are zooms from Fig. 11.\nAs expected, they display the gain growing as oil pollution\nincreases. However, this trend is more noticeable for low\nconcentration (Fig. 12.a) than for higher ones (Fig. 12.b).\nFor low frequencies (20 Hz up to 1 kHz), the FRA\nresponse is representative of the capacitor behavior (see\nFig. 12). As relative permittivity increases with oil degra-\ndation, the sensor capacitance and, consequently, the output\nvoltage increases. This results in a gain increase. The pro-\nposed testing procedure is based on this fact. Then, models\nrelating concentration with gain can be ﬁtted.\nGraphically, and at constant frequency, the theory states\nthat the curves must move up with oil degradation. How-\never, in practice, this is more complex. For this reason,\nrelations between water concentration and gain for several\nfrequencies are needed.

Then, a combination of two exponential\nfunctions are used to estimate water concentration in trans-\nformer oil.\nIn the experiments carried out to design the method,\nthe values shown in Table 4 for the parameters k1, k2, µ, σ,\nα, βand R2 have been obtained.\nTABLE 4. Values for the parameters of the oil degradation model.\nIt can be seen in the ﬁtted results shown in Fig. 13.a\nand Fig. 13.b, that better correlation coefﬁcients (0.9963 and\n0.9948) were obtained for the lower frequencies (50 Hz and\n100 Hz respectively).\nFrom the ﬁgures and parameters obtained, the ﬁrst conclu-\nsion drawn is that the measurements should be made at low\nfrequencies if accuracy is pursued.\nOn one hand, the measurement equipment must be accurate\nenough to detect variations of 0.5 decibels when the range is\nbetween −55 dB and −51 dB at 1 V RMS input. On the other\nhand, results obtained at higher frequencies have not a clear\ntrend and, so, the model performance is poor.\nThen, using an appropriate measurement device, and read-\ning voltages at a 50 resistor in the output terminal of the\ncapacitor, the concentration of water in a previous character-\nized ﬂuid can be determined. The results corroborate these\npremises with excellent results for low frequencies.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis article presents a new online method to evaluate oil\naging. It is based on the relative permittivity variation of\ntransformer oil caused by changes in its water content. This\nmethod uses a capacitive sensor dived in transformer oil. The\ntransformer can be in operation during the tests.\nThis method performs FRA tests to the capacitive sensor.\nThe sensor has to be previously calibrated through several\nFRA tests for this particular oil, with different moisture\ncontents.\nA prototype capacitive sensor has been designed, built and\ntested. This prototype has been calibrated by FRA laboratory\ntests with water contents between healthy and 1000 ppm.\nThe results of experimental tests show an increase of 4 dB\nfor low frequencies (50-100 Hz) when water concentration\nincreases between 10 and 40 ppm. This is the standard water\nVOLUME 9, 2021 7583\nJ. M. Guerreroet al.: Transformer Oil Diagnosis Based on a Capacitive Sensor FRA\ncontent of power transformers. Additionally, sensor perfor-\nmance has been simulated, obtaining results in accordance\nwith the experimental tests. They demonstrate that the results\nobtained through experimentation are supported by theoreti-\ncal principles.\nSumming up, the proposed sensor and method could be\nuseful to evaluate power transformer oil condition. This\nmethod has the advantage that disconnection of the power\ntransformer is not required.\nFuture research will address temperature effect in the\ncharacterization of oil FRA tests. In the presented research,\nthe experimental tests were performed at 70 ◦C. However,\nit is well known that temperature has a notable inﬂuence in\noil moisture measurement. Consequently, additional exper-\nimental tests will be made at different temperatures. Then,\nthe regression model for oil moisture estimation (Eq. 8) will\nbe modiﬁed in order to include sample temperature.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of\nDíaz, Talavera, Peña, and Ms. Martín for their implication in\nthis work.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
