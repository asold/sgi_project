  "abstract": "When we talk about multimedia learning, we can ask several questions to ourselves understand the effect of information and communication technologies (ICT's) on our lives.ICT's have introduced new instructions that we use to think; consequently, the ways in which we think would also change.New identities are born that are connected to communication tools.From the viewpoint of applied linguistics, we are specifically interested in the effects that these communicative skills can have on the processes of language production and interpretation.Our conceptions of language and communication have changed substantially with the arrival of computer and its digital capabilities.Communications have also changed considerably.These changes have affected the school communities and the relationships established between teachers and students now involve other modes of cognitive involvement and social interactions made possible by digital online communications.In this paper, the researchers discuss the issues of ICT, multimedia learning, its principles, CALL, its advantages and implications of multimedia learning.Then multimodal learning, multimodality and second language acquisition, and implications of multimodality in language learning and teaching will be discussed.A review of the literature will determine how multimodal models affect the teaching and learning processes.",
