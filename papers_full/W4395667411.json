  "abstract": "Abstract Sentiment analysis is an essential task in natural language processing that involves identifying a text’s polarity, whether it expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. With the growth of social media and the Internet, sentiment analysis has become increasingly important in various fields, such as marketing, politics, and customer service. However, sentiment analysis becomes challenging when dealing with foreign languages, particularly without labelled data for training models. In this study, we propose an ensemble model of transformers and a large language model (LLM) that leverages sentiment analysis of foreign languages by translating them into a base language, English. We used four languages, Arabic, Chinese, French, and Italian, and translated them using two neural machine translation models: LibreTranslate and Google Translate. Sentences were then analyzed for sentiment using an ensemble of pre-trained sentiment analysis models: Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment-Latest, bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and GPT-3, which is an LLM from OpenAI. Our experimental results showed that the accuracy of sentiment analysis on translated sentences was over 86% using the proposed model, indicating that foreign language sentiment analysis is possible through translation to English, and the proposed ensemble model works better than the independent pre-trained models and LLM.",
