Investment in early childhood initiatives\nin low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is\nincreasing. These initiatives use early childhood\ndevelopmental assessment tools (CDATs) as outcome\nmeasures. CDATs are also key measures in the\nevaluation of programmatic health initiatives in LMICs,\ninﬂuencing public health policy. Interpretation of CDAT\noutcomes requires understanding of their structure and\npsychometric properties. This article reviews the structure\nand main methods of CDAT development with speciﬁc\nconsiderations when applied in LMICs.\nINTRODUCTION\nIt is estimated that up to 200 million children fail\nto reach their developmental potential in low-\nincome and middle-income countries (LMICs). 1\nThis statistic underpins recent calls for urgent\nglobal action to improve early child development in\nthe ﬁrst 5 years of life.\n2 Poverty , malnutrition,\nrecurrent and/or chronic infectious diseases plus\ninadequate cognitive stimulation, can all have life-\nlong consequences on development.\n3–5 Economic\nmodelling studies demonstrate how early interven-\ntions and investment in disadvantaged children are\neffective in improving child development and cost-\neffective in improving the‘human capital’potential\nof individuals.\n6 Investment in early child develop-\nment initiatives in LMICs is burgeoning and with\nthis, prioritisation of global health research into\ninterventions that have maximum impact on child\ndevelopment. Speciﬁ c child development assess-\nment tools (CDATs) are recommended by major\nresearch funding bodies as appropriate tools to\nevaluate child development interventions, despite\nlimited evidence of the nature of the CDATs’ rela-\ntionship with quality of life measures and later\npotential human capital.\n78 Since no CDAT is suit-\nable for all populations, a variety of tools have\nbeen developed worldwide.\n9 T ypically , knowledge\nof the structure, psychometric properties, applic-\nability and limitations of CDAT is restricted to\nchild development specialists. In practice, health\nworkers from various backgrounds often administer\nand interpret these tests. This article describes the\nstructure, main methods of CDAT development\nand their application, focusing on children less than\n5 years of age in LMICs.\nWHAT IS A CHILD DEVELOPMENTAL\nASSESSMENT TOOL, WHAT DO THEY MEASURE\nAND HOW ARE THEY ADMINISTERED?\nEarly childhood is a period of rapid physical\ngrowth during which an individual acquires a\ncomplex set of skills and functional competencies\nthat should facilitate achievement of their potential\nin life. W eight and height charts were developed on\nthe premise that children from similar ethnic back-\ngrounds follow similar growth trajectories. In a\ncomparable fashion, acquisition of skills during\nearly childhood is also expected to follow a set tra-\njectory . For growth and development we know that\nit is best to intervene promptly in order to maintain\na healthy trajectory .\n10–12 US legislative changes\nincorporated in the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act 2004 specify the use of standardised\nCDATs to evaluate the following developmental\ndomains; cognitive, language, motor, adaptive and\nsocioemotional, in order to guide diagnostic inves-\ntigations and interventions (table 1).\n13 14\nEach domain of development is assessed by the\nchild’s ability to carry out a series of increasingly\ncomplex activities that are thought to reﬂect the\nexpected level of development at a particular age.\nThe developmental domains evaluated by CDAT\ndo not function as discrete entities but inﬂuence\neach other— for example, to successfully complete\na jigsaw puzzle requires a combination of cognitive\nand ﬁne motor skills, and sufﬁcient understanding\nof language to process instructions.\nMethods to assess child development may\ninclude: (A) direct assessment of standardised activ-\nities by a trained assessor in a clinical environment,\n(B) verbal reporting/completion of a questionnaire\nabout the child’s abilities by parents or teachers\nand (C) unstructured observation by a trained asses-\nsor in an environment familiar to the child\n(eg, home/school). Direct testing in an unfamiliar\nenvironment by an unfamiliar adult may restrict a\nchild’s engagement and participation in the assess-\nment. Parental reporting, on the other hand, may\nbe affected by recall bias.\n8 Unstructured observa-\ntion can be difﬁcult to reproduce and interpret. An\nideal CDAT would include aspects of all three\nmethods, but with limitedﬁnancial resources, often\none method is chosen.\n8\nTYPES OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS— SCREENING\nVERSUS FORMAL ASSESSMENT?\nScreening tools are administered quickly , using a\nlimited sample of items representing a domain and\nrely on predetermined cut-off points.

Screening tools are bene ﬁcial when used within the\ncontext of a development surveillance programme, where there\nare appropriate norms and known applicability in speci ﬁc\nsubgroups.\n15\nMost formal tools require specialised speci ﬁc training of\nassessors. They allow administration of items above or below\nthe age bracket of the child thus allowing the child’s strengths\nand weaknesses to be categorised more accurately . Formal assess-\nments can be administered repeatedly to evaluate changes over\ntime and/or following an intervention.\nIS THE TOOL MEASURING WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED\nTO— VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY?\nDevelopmental domains are a theoretical concept, typically\nreferred to as‘constructs’ in the psychometric literature. These\ncannot be directly measured but are inferred through the child’s\nperformance on a number of observed variables (test items).\nReliability is the variability of scores obtained by an individual if\nrepeatedly given the same test. There are widely cited levels of\nacceptable reliability for testing,\n16 however the result should be\ninterpreted in context. For example, retest reliability can be\ninﬂuenced by developmental maturation over the time interval,\nor training by the caregiver following mistakes seen in theﬁrst\nassessment.\n17 V alidity is the accuracy of the score representing\nthe construct of interest.8 In addition, screening tools are evalu-\nated for sensitivity , speciﬁcity , positive predictive value and\nnegative predictive value. Reliability and validity of CDAT can\nbe evaluated through several methods, summarised intable 2.\nHOW TO DETERMINE A CHILD’S PERFORMANCE ON THE\nCDAT— THE REFERENCE POPULATION\nAll assessment tools have a threshold that a child must achieve\nfor the assessor to be conﬁdent that there are no current devel-\nopmental concerns. There are two main ways of setting this\nthreshold, norm referencing and criterion referencing. A norm-\nreferenced test is usually administered in a standardised manner\nand the individual child’s scores in each domain are compared\nwith scores from a large representative sample of children of the\nsame age and sex (normative data). Standard scores allow\ncomparison between scales evaluating the same domain and\nmonitoring of individuals at different ages. By contrast,\ncriterion-referenced tests assess whether a child has acquired a\nparticular skill by a certain age, according to a speciﬁc curricu-\nlum. Administration may not be standardised, since individual\nchildren sometimes require additional instructions or physical\naids to complete a particular task but are then able to complete\nthe speciﬁed tests. Criterion-referenced tests are often used in\nscreening procedures, for example assessment of reading skills\nat school entry , or evaluation of an intervention such as a pro-\ngramme of physical therapy . In some cases criterion-based tests\nhave been standardised on large representative populations.\nThere are concerns that the rapidly changing nature of society\nmeans that normative data become outdated very quickly . T o\ncounter this, inclusion of a control group is now considered\ncrucial for research studies, even when the normative popula-\ntion is contemporaneous and comes from the same linguistic\nand cultural background as the study population.\nWHEN TO ASSESS DEVELOPMENT, WHAT DOES IT MEAN\nFOR THE FUTURE— PREDICTIVE VALIDITY?\nCDAT will only give a snapshot of the child at that time point.\nT raits that have not yet evolved in early childhood clearly cannot\nbe assessed until such time as they might reasonably be expected\nto be present, and yet impairment within these characteristics\nmay impact subsequent development signiﬁcantly .\n18\nAfter an assessment, it is important to know the predictive\nvalidity of the CDAT score, whether normal or abnormal.\nCorrelations between early childhood performance and school\nabilities in normal children are variable.\n19 Children with moder-\nate developmental delay , despite the same initial difﬁculties, have\ngreat variability in developmental trajectories, with some chil-\ndren catching up while others exhibit evolving difﬁculties with\nage.20 Aspects of early development may be predictive of later\nacademic ability . Preschool English language acquisition of\nvocabulary , grammar and descriptive phrasing predicted school\nreading ability in a prospective longitudinal US study .\n20a\nResearch in normal infants suggests that acquisition of efﬁcient\nTable 1 Developmental domains\nDevelopmental domains\nand subdomains Description of domain\nCognitive39 40 Strategies and processes children develop to interpret and respond to their environment and experiences including; memory (ability to encode,\nretain and recall information over time) attention (the ability to choose what to focus on for a sustained period), that influence memory\nlanguage skills which as the brain develops children acquire and refine language skills.\nNewborn explores the world by mouthing objects; and later explores the world by imitating actions, manipulating objects and planning\ntwo-step strategies to get what he wants.\nFrom 2 years, children increase their use of language and start make-believe play.\nIn children aged 3– 5 years there is rapid development in information processing (the speed and fluency of response following stimuli),\ncognitive flexibility (the ability to make and change strategies as required, and to simultaneously process multiple stimuli) and goal setting\n(the ability to plan strategies in a coherent and efficient order).\nLanguage\n41\nReceptive Understanding of the spoken word and sentence structure\nExpressive Spoken vocabulary\nMotor42\nFine motor Ability to manipulate small objects\nGross motor Ability to walk, run and coordinate complex physical activities\nSocial and emotional42 43 The ability to identify and understand one’s own feelings and to accurately read and comprehend emotional states in others.

Three lon-\ngitudinal nutritional intervention studies collected CDAT scores\nin infants from Indonesia and Guatemala.\n23 Scores on 2\nmonthly assessments correlated poorly in infants less than\n24 months, but score correlations increased on assessments\ncarried out between 24 months and 30 months of age. The\nscores at age 20 months or younger had no predictive value for\nverbal reasoning and arithmetic scores at school age. Overall,\npredictive power in comparative US research was similar.\n24\nThere is still a lack of evidence as to whether the interpretation\nof group differences in scores due to an intervention or expos-\nure in infancy should be interpreted as predicting anything in\nterms of later intelligence.\n23\nAPPROACHES AND CHALLENGES OF CDAT DEVELOPMENT\nIN LMICS\nCurrently , only a few CDATs are available in LMICs and most\nare used in research settings. These CDATs typically follow one\nof the following formats: (A) a standard western CDAT with no\nadaptations; (B) a western CDAT translated (linguistic equiva-\nlence) and/or adapted for the local cultural environment (cul-\ntural equivalence); (C) an amalgamation of a number of\ntranslated and/or adapted items from several different western\nCDATs; or (D) a locally developed, culturally speciﬁcC D A T\nconsisting of original items designed to be relevant to the popu-\nlation of interest.\n25 The format of CDAT adaptation depends on\nthe aim of the application. Rie et al evaluated the impact of\nHIV on neurodevelopment of children in Kinchasa, Congo. The\nresearchers deliberately used a direct translation of a western\nCDAT without cultural adaptation to compare between groups\nin the same setting and then compare between past and future\nstudies in other settings.\n26 This method does not ensure that the\ntool is measuring the same underlying ability in all settings.\nHolding et al\n27 aimed to facilitate comparisons between differ-\nent cultural groups in differing countries and needed to measure\nthe same underlying ability in all settings. This was done by cul-\ntural modiﬁcation of a western tool. The Kiliﬁ Developmental\nChecklist (KDC) was also based on items from a range of\nCDAT s.\n28 The items were chosen based on ease of observing\nitem success, how well the item could differentiate within the\npopulation of interest and if the item could be readily described\nin the local languages. Additional considerations pertaining to\nLMICs include the prohibitive cost of the license fee to translate\nor adapt a western CDAT , the level of skill of the assessor and\nlocation of assessment. Fernandeset al\n29 developed a screening\ntool for use in high-income countries and LMICs. The team\nfaced the challenge of developing a culture-free tool that was\nlow in cost, could be administered after limited level of assessor\ntraining and completed in 30 min. T o achieve this, an advisory\npanel listed project-speci ﬁc criteria that the CDAT needed\nto fulﬁl.\nOnce items are selected, the ﬁrst step is pilot studies on a\nsmall number of children. These aim to discover the range of\nresponses elicited from the tested population and identify pro-\nblems with unfamiliar stimulus materials. Pradoet al\n17 adapted\na cognitive test for Indonesian children, who had difﬁculty iden-\ntifying a picture of a bunny , so replaced it with a picture of a\nTable 2 Basic psychometric properties used to evaluate child development assessment tools (CDATs)\nRelevance/\nImportance Comment\nReliability\nInternal\nconsistency\nEvaluates the similarity of test items assessed in one domain. One\nmeasure is split-half reliability, which compares the scores on two halves\nof a test in a single domain.\nHigh internal consistency suggests that some items are too similar, so no\nadditional information is gained from assessing them. Low internal\nconsistency suggests the items may not be assessing the same domain.\nInterobserver Evaluates variability between different assessors on the same subject There may be systematic errors, specific to a particular group of assessors,\nand this parameter may not be generalisable when the tool is used by a\ndifferent group of assessors.\nIntraobserver Evaluates variability within a single assessor on a single subject Commonly evaluated by the same assessor scoring video recordings of\ntheir own assessments. This is not essential unless there is low\ninterobserver reliability\nValidity\nTest-retest Evaluates variability within the subject (influenced by random factors such\nas familiarity with items and mood)\nDifficult to interpret in early childhood when changes in development occur\nover a short time.

To ensure the test is not overlapping with\nconstructs not of interest, the scores evaluating different constructs should\npoorly correlate, for example, test scores on‘fine motor’ should correlate\npoorly with ‘social emotional’.\nConstruct Statistical evaluation to see whether values of observed data fit a\ntheoretical model of the constructs (confirmatory) or to explore a possible\nmodel of the‘underlying traits’ being measured.\nLarge numbers of assessments are required to evaluate this.\n484 Sabanathan S, et al.

Despite modi ﬁcation to the KDC following pilot\nstudies, audit ofﬁnal study scores found some items could not\nbe successfully completed by at least one child less than\n36 months of age.30 These data were used to reﬁne and then\nexpand the KDC to create the Kiliﬁ Developmental Inventory .30\nIn some situations, no appropriate tool exists and new test\nitems need to be devised. This requires understanding of the\ndomain being measured and the cultural references of the rele-\nvant population, but can still be problematic. The most\ncommon method of developing new items is to engage partici-\npant representatives of the population in focus groups.\nDecisions regarding who will participate and how the informa-\ntion will be transcribed and analysed are important factors in\nthe process. Local experts evaluate the suitability of particular\nitems for a target group, and evaluate whether items adequately\ncover the domain under investigation. Gladstoneet al\n31 adapted\na tool for Malawi but needed to devise new items for the social/\nemotional domain. Themes for new items were devised from\nfocus groups, and despite good face and content validity , pilot\ntesting results identiﬁed that the new items did not perform well\nwhen compared in terms of their psychometric properties\nalongside original items. An iterative process of adaption and\ntesting led to two more draft versions of the Malawi\nDevelopmental Assessment T ool before the team successfully\ndeveloped theﬁnal version.\n32\nT able 3presents examples of the basic structure and psycho-\nmetric properties of several CDATs developed for LMICs.\nWHAT HAVE WE LEARNT FROM CDATS IN LMICS: FACTORS\nTHAT INFLUENCE EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT IN LMICS\nDebate on the inﬂuence of nurture versus nature continues,\nalthough an increasing body of opinion now considers the early\nperinatal environment to be as important in determining cogni-\ntive ability as an individual’s genetic background. Intrauterine\nenvironment, nutritional deﬁciency in infancy , infectious dis-\neases and poverty , all shape the developmental trajectory of a\nchild in a LMIC. What we know about these threats to develop-\nment come from research using CDAT . W alkeret al\n33 reviewed\nthe risk and protective factors of early child development that\ncan be modiﬁed by interventions in children under the age of\n5 years in LMICs, including iron deﬁciency , malaria and inad-\nequate cognitive stimulation. These three factors illustrate chal-\nlenges of CDAT interpretation. Three prospective iron\nsupplementation trials unexpectedly found no change in cogni-\ntive development measured by an adapted western CDAT .\n34 It\nwas plausible that the CDAT was not sensitive enough to the\neffects of supplementation of a nutritional deﬁciency , resulting\nin a shift to a more hypothesis-driven, focused testing of speciﬁc\nareas of development.35 This shift to ensure the CDAT can\nevaluate hypothesised outcomes based on biological mechanisms\nwas incorporated into developing an appropriate CDAT for\nsevere malaria.\n36 A team in Kiliﬁ adapted a western tool for\nschool-age children and then successfully evaluated its construct\nvalidity and sensitivity for discriminating cognitive deﬁcits fol-\nlowing severe malaria (high-risk), mild malaria (medium risk)\nand no previous admission with malaria (low-risk).\n27 There\nwere signiﬁcant differences in scores between unschooled high-\nrisk children and unschooled low-risk children. There was no\nsigniﬁcant difference in scores between high-risk and low-risk\nmalaria children who were at school, highlighting the plausible\nbeneﬁt of formalised education in protecting from neurocogni-\ntive sequelae in LMIC settings. This ﬁnding was put into\ncontext by the authors, who reported that the group attending\nschool was not necessarily representative of severe children,\nsince school attendance is limited by economic restraints and\nparental perception of whether their child would beneﬁtf r o m\nformal schooling. A child perceived to have cognitive deﬁcits by\ntheir parents might not be sent to school. In a setting with a\nmultitude of biological threats to early child development, the\naddition of poverty will limit the beneﬁcial opportunities of a\nchild’s environmental inﬂuence on their development. However,\nthere is variability in parental attitudes and behaviours within\none socioeconomic class and also variability within the same\nsocioeconomic class between cultures. A South African Home\nScreening Questionnaire, found mental development was primar-\nily accounted for by the mother's ability to structure the child's\nenvironment for learning.\n36a This was through the provision of\nplay materials and maternal involvement in the child’s activities,\nwhich were believed to promote development. The authors con-\ncluded that the socioeconomic variables evaluated did not solely\ndetermine maternal behaviour. Supporting this premise are\nstudies suggesting maternal stimulation programmes within early\nchildhood community-based stimulation interventions that can\nhave long-lasting beneﬁts on cognitive, socioemotional well-\nbeing despite adverse socioeconomic environments.\n37 CDAT\nresearch will continue to inform the agenda for early interven-\ntion, before lifelong trajectories leading to large health and eco-\nnomic inequalities becomeﬁxed.\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nChildhood developmental outcomes are ﬁrmly on the current\nglobal health agenda particularly now that it is time to set the\nnew millennium developmental goals. However the relationship\nbetween future employability , quality of life measures and per-\nformance on a CDAT before the age of 5 years, is not known.\nLongitudinal research is needed to evaluate these relationships.\nIn LMICs where early intervention support is limited, robust\nCDAT construction within culturally acceptable early child\ndevelopment programmes will help explore the relationship\nwith later outcomes and promote the factors which protect\nagainst the neurocognitive detrimental effects of adversities\nfaced by children in LMICs.\n38\nQUICK CHECKLIST FOR APPRAISING A CDAT\n1. Does the CDAT adequately measure all aspects of the\ndomain(s) theoretically affected by a risk factor or intervention?\n2. Has the CDAT been shown to be reliable and valid in the\npopulation of interest?\n3. Is the CDAT sensitive enough in the setting required to iden-\ntify the changes expected for the risk factor or intervention?\n4. Are the number of evaluations and duration of follow-up\nsuitable for evaluating the outcome of interest?\n5. In research studies, is there a suitable control group and\nhave potential inﬂuences been considered?\nContributors SS conceived the article and wrote theﬁrst draft of the manuscript,\nwhich was then critically revised by BW and MG.
