    "abstract": "With the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs), information\\nretrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines and recommender systems, have\\nundergone a significant paradigm shift. This evolution, while heralding new\\nopportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases\\nand unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we\\npresent a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias\\nand unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first\\nunify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a\\ngroundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution\\nalignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and\\nunfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into\\nIR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing\\nso, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the\\ndefinitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies\\nassociated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open\\nproblems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and\\nstakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias\\nand unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a\\nGitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising\\ndirection at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.\\n",
