The process of finding suitable metaphase chromosomes for accurate\nclinical analysis is, however, very time consuming since they are selected manually. The selection of suitable\nmetaphase chromosome spreads thus represents a major bottleneck for conventional cytogenetic analysis.\nAlthough many algorithms have been developed for karyotyping, none have adequately addressed the critical\nbottleneck of selecting suitable chromosome spreads. In this paper, we present a software tool that uses a simple\nrule-based system to efficiently identify metaphase spreads suitable for karyotyping.\nResults: The chromosome shapes can be classified by the software into four main classes. The first and the second\nclasses refer to individual chromosomes with straight and skewed shapes, respectively. The third class is\ncharacterized as those chromosomes with overlapping bodies and the fourth class is for the non-chromosome\nobjects. Good metaphase spreads should largely contain chromosomes of the first and the second classes, while\nthe third class should be kept minimal. Several image parameters were examined and used for creating rule-based\nclassification. The threshold value for each parameter is determined using a statistical model. We observed that the\nGaussian model can represent the empirical probability density function of the parameters and, hence, the\nthreshold value can be easily determined. The proposed rules can efficiently and accurately classify the individual\nchromosome with > 90% accuracy.\nConclusions: The software tool, termed MetaSel, was developed. Using the Gaussian-based rules, the tool can be used\nto quickly rank hundreds of chromosome spread images so as to assist cytogeneticists to perform karyotyping\neffectively. Furthermore, MetaSel offers an intuitive, yet comprehensive, workflow to assist karyotyping, including tools\nfor editing chromosome (split, merge and fix) and a karyotyping editor (moving, rotating, and pairing homologous\nchromosomes). The program can be freely downloaded from“http://www4a.biotec.or.th/GI/tools/metasel“.\nBackground\nIn cytogenetic studies, abnormalities in chromosome\nstructure are examined by microscopy. Each human cell\nnormally has 23 pairs of chromosomes, consisting of 22\npairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes\n[1,2]. Cytogenetic abnormalities are manifested as extra or\nfewer chromosomes than normal, e.g., having three copies\nof chromosome 21 in Down’s syndrome, one of the most\ncommon abnormalities. Cytogenetic testing for abnormal-\nities requires high-quality metaphase chromosome images,\nwhich are selected and sorted as shown in Figure 1.\nIn order to obtain enough analyzable metaphase\nspread images, at least 8 to 10 glass slide specimens\nhave to be prepared for each individual. Each glass slide\ntypically contains about 10-20 metaphase spreads. From\nthe total of approximately 200 prepared metaphases,\n* Correspondence: sissades@biotec.or.th\n6National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Thailand\nScience Park, Pathum Thani, Thailand\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nUttamatanin et al.

Once the chromosome complement\nis verified, generally two to five of the“sharpest” images\nare chosen for chromosome banding analysis for detect-\ning chromosome band abnormalities. Each step in this\nprocess is time consuming and requires experienced\ncytogeneticists to operate. Thus, considerable effort has\nbeen made to develop automated chromosome image\nanalysis tools to expedite this procedure.\nEach metaphase spread contains not only chromosome\nimages but also some cell preparation artifacts [1-5].\nThese non-chromosome residues can be eliminated by\nvisual inspection. However, in order to obtain an accurate\nkaryotyping result, the metaphase spread must contain a\nlarge number of analyzable chromosomes, i.e., with clear\nbanding patterns not obscured by overlapping chromo-\nsomes. Previous research efforts have mainly focused\non segmentation of overlapping chromosomes [1,6,7].\nHowever, when overlapping chromosome images are seg-\nmented, the regions of chromosome overlap are ambigu-\nous, which could potentially lead to an inaccurate\ndiagnosis. Therefore, getting clean metaphase spreads with\nwell-separated individual chromosomes is preferable.\nOther earlier studies on chromosome analysis have\nconcentrated on automatic karyotyping which attempts\nto order and classify the chromosomes into 22 pairs of\nautosomes and the two sex chromosomes. Automatic\nkaryotyping requires very informative features, such as\nband profiles, centromere positions, chromosome\ndimensions, etc. Automatic karyotyping is based on the\nassumption that the input contains analyzable meta-\nphases. Numerous algorithms have been proposed to\nfacilitate automatic karyotyping [4-7]. A recent techni-\nque proposed by Moallem et al. [17] used dark paths\nbetween chromosomes for classifying touching and\noverlapping chromosomes from good metaphase images.\nKhan et al. [18] presented a technique to geometrically\ncorrect deformed chromosomes so that the chromo-\nsomes can be karyotyped correctly. Jahani et al [19]\nfocused on classification by identifying chromosome\ncentromeres and their corresponding length.\nTo perform automatic karyotyping, hundreds of images\nmust be manually examined in order to select spreads\ncomprising mostly metaphase chromosomes for further\nanalysis. The goal is thus to select the best metaphase\nspreads with clearly separated individual chromosomes\nfor karyotyping. The selection of good, metaphase\nspreads is very time consuming, perhaps requiring hours\nof expert inspection of hundreds of specimens. Thus, the\ncytogeneticist will normally select approximately 20 of\nthe first good metaphase spreads that he/she has encoun-\ntered, instead of examining all metaphase spreads from\nall specimen slides. Hence, this arbitrary approach may\nexclude better metaphase spreads, and so lead to sub-\noptimal results. There is thus a need for a more thorough\nand efficient method of selecting good metaphase spreads\nfor karyotyping. Although some techniques have been\nFigure 1 Metaphase image and Karyotyping image.

BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 16):S13\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105-14/S16/S13\nPage 2 of 13\nproposed for automatic metaphase selection, in practice\nthese techniques are impractical for processing hundreds\nof images in a typical cytogenetic analysis owing to the\nhigh computational complexity [1-3,,5]; [13-15].\nTo our knowledge, there are only two works that have\naddressed the problem of improving the efficiency of\nautomated metaphase selection. The first study [12] con-\ncentrated on rapid identification of metaphase, but did\nnot assess metaphasequality, i.e. the selection of analyz-\nable versus non-analyzable metaphase. The second\napproach in [9] utilizes skeletal analysis of chromosome\nimages in order to estimate the number of analyzable\nchromosomes; hence, it can quickly select a few good\nmetaphase spreads in terms of quality. However, the time\nto process each image can take up to 5 minutes, which is\nstill not practical when dealing with a large number\n(>100) of images.\nTo address the aforementioned problems, this work\npresents a rapid, practical chromosome classification tool\nfor identification of good metaphase spreads based on\nrule-based classification. The software, called MetaSel, is\nthe first attempt to offer a free assistive karyotyping tool\nfor chromosome analysis. The software employs a heuris-\ntic that first defines important image parameters for\nchromosome feature extraction and then constructs rules\nfor chromosome classification.\nMaterials and methods\nOverview\nSpecimens for cytogenetic testing were obtained by a\nstandard clinical procedure a t the Rajanukul Institute,\nMinistry of Public Health, Bangkok. In brief, cells from\namniocentesis samples from pregnant women were\napplied to glass slides and stained with Giemsa. Chromo-\nsome images were obtained by microscopy using the\nZeiss Axioskop2 model. A metaphase spread contains\nsome individual chromosomes as well as other chromo-\nsomes that may not be well spread out, i.e., overlapping\nor touching. We defined objects from the metaphase\nspreads into four classes (Figure 2). The first three classes\nFigure 2 Types of chromosome classification . Chromosomes from Class-1 and Class-2 are individually separated. Both classes are\ndifferentiated by their straightness, i.e., Class-1 is straight individual chromosome while Class-2 is individually separable but with bended or\nskewed structure. Class-3 chromosomes are those that appear touching/overlapping with other chromosomes. Finally, Class-4 is characterized as\nnon-chromosome residues and to be excluded in future analyses.\nUttamatanin et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 16):S13\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105-14/S16/S13\nPage 3 of 13\nare in fact the underlying chromosomes whereas Class-4\nis considered as residues or artifacts, e.g., cell debris. Indi-\nvidual chromosomes from Class-1 and Class-2 can be dis-\ntinguished by their straightness. Chromosomes from both\nclasses must be individually separable. Hence, Class-1 is\ndefined as straight individual chromosome, while Class-2\nis defined as skewed or bended individual chromosome.\nChromosomes from Class-3 comprise other non-indivi-\ndual chromosomes that may be overlapping or touching\nwith other chromosomes in the vicinity.\nPre-processing\nFirst an image is enhanced by using the histogram equali-\nzation threshold as described in [10,11] for adjusting the\ngray level in the image. Then, we attempted to separate\nthe real chromosome image from its background. This\nprocess is called image segmentation in image processing\n[16]. In order to do the segmentation, we adopted the\nOtsu’s automatic threshold technique [8] to isolate the\nchromosome image from the background.\nChromosome classification\nWe performed image segmentation and rotated the\nresulting objects into their vertical orientation in order to\nclassify segmented objects from metaphase spreads. The\nimage parameters, namely width, height, and estimated\narea ratio, are extracted from the rotated images. The\nwidth and height parameters of each chromosome seg-\nment are the important factors used to quickly character-\nize the chromosomal objects into the four classifications.\nIn particular, the area ratio can be defined as:\nArearatio = Ao\nAr\nwhere Ar is the number of pixels inside the smallest\nenclosing rectangle (Wrect ×Hrect) of the segmented object\nand Ao is the number of pixels of the segmented object.\nFigure 3 shows image parameters for chromosome image\nclassification, whereWrect and Hrect are the width and the\nheight of the minimum rectangle of segmented objects in\npixel unit.\nThe area ratio quantifies the amount of the actual object\npixels per the pixels inside the rectangle box demarcating\nthe object. This ratio can beeffectively used to classify the\nstraightness of the chromosome. We verified this ratio by\nperforming statistical analysis of randomly chosen chro-\nmosome area ratios from 822 straight and 1012 touching/\noverlapping (including skewed objects) chromosomes. The\nempirical probability density function was estimated using\nthe kernel density method (Figure 4). Gaussian model was\nused to determine the threshold value of the area ratio for\nclassification. When the area ratio is greater than 67.84%,\nthe chromosome can be classified as Class-1 (straight\nobjects). However, this class may contain some non-chro-\nmosome residues that need to be excluded.\nSince the width of Class-1 chromosomes should be\nconsistent, deviation from their average width is consid-\nered as residual objects. To detect these remainders, we\nfirst determine the total average width of all objects with\nthe area ratio > 67.84%. If the object width is greater than\nFigure 3 Image parameters for chromosome image classification. The segmented chromosomal objects in the left metaphase image are\nrotated into vertical orientation and calculated image parameters.Wrect and Hrect are width (pixel) and height (pixel) of the smallest enclosing\nrectangle of the segmented object respectively.\nUttamatanin et al.

LetOw represent the set of objects with the\nunderlying width less than 1.5 times of the total average\nwidth. The chromosome width of each object (W)i nt h e\nset Ow can be defined as:\nWi = Total number of pixels in chromosome\nHrect\nThen, the average width is defined as:\nWavg =\n∑\ni∈OW\nWi\n|OW |\nTo quantify the deviation from the average width, we\ndefine the rectangle width ratio as:\nWrectratio = Wrect\nWavg\nClearly, the deviation from the unity of Wrect ratio\nentails differences in terms of the quality of chromosome\nstraightness. Thus, the threshold value of the rectangle\nwidth ratio for Class-1 is determined by the probability\ndistribution of Wrect ratio .T h ee x p e r i m e n t a ls t u d i e so f\nthis ratio were performed using 222, 327 and 500 samples\nof small, large residual objects and straight individual\nchromosomes respectively. The empirical and Gaussian\nprobability density functions ofWrectratio are depicted in\nFigure 5. When 0.9897≤ Wrectratio ≤ 1.5597, the corre-\nsponding object will be classified as straight individual\nchromosome (Class-1). When Wrect ratio <0.9897, the\nchromosome object will be classified as a small non-\nchromosome residue (Class-4). Moreover, the object can\nbe classified as Class-4 when Wrect ratio > 1.5597, i.e.,\nbeing a large object.\nWhen Wrectratio < 67.84%, the corresponding object can\nbe classified as either skewed individual chromosome or\nFigure 4 Empirical and Gaussian probability density functions of the area ratio. Gaussian model was used to determine the threshold\nvalue of the area ratio for classification. When the area ratio is greater than 67.84%, the chromosome can be classified as Class-1, straight object.\nUttamatanin et al.

To distinguish\nbetween skewed objects and non-chromosome residues,\nthe height of segmented object is defined as:\nHi = Ao\nWavg\nThe ratio betweenHi and Hrect,h e i g h tr a t i o(Hiratio), is\ncomputed by.\nHiratio = Hi\nHrect\nWe observed 600 skewed objects and overlapping chro-\nmosomes as well as 70 non-chromosome residues. The\nstatistical analysis was performed to determine the thresh-\nold value of the height ratio for screening out unwanted\nresidual objects. Figure 6 presents the empirical probability\ndensity function of the height ratio which can be\napproximated by the Gaussian model. Using this model,\nchromosome objects will be classified as“residual” when\nHiratio < 0.7507. WhenHiratio ≥ 0.7507, the objects will be\nclassified as mixing between skewed objects and touching/\noverlapping chromosomes.\nTo separate skewed objects from those touching/over-\nlapping chromosomes, one additional parameter must be\nused. It can be observed that the width of an overlapping\nchromosome will be larger than the width of a skewed\nindividual. This parameter, called maximum width ratio\n(Wmaxratio ), therefore, can be computed by using the\nmaximum object width in pixels (Wmax) and the average\nwidth (Wavg):\nW maxratio = Wmax\nWavg\nFigure 5 Empirical and Gaussian probability density functions of theWrectratio. The experimental studies of this ratio were performed\nusing 222, 327 and 500 samples of small, large residual objects and straight individual chromosomes respectively. When 0.9897≤ Wrectratio ≤\n1.5597, the object is classified as straight individual chromosome (Class-1) while ifWrectratio <0.9897 indicates that the object is potentially a\nsmall non-chromosome residue (Class-4). The object is considered to be a large residue (Class-4) whenWrectratio > 1.5597.\nUttamatanin et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 16):S13\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105-14/S16/S13\nPage 6 of 13\nThe threshold to separate skewed chromosome indivi-\nduals from overlapping chromosomes was determined\nby using statistical analysis . The empirical probability\ndensity functions of skewed individuals and overlapping\nchromosomes were determined using 593 and 393 sam-\nples respectively. The Gaussian model was used to\napproximate the empirical model for threshold calcula-\ntion. The threshold for separating skewed individuals\nand overlapping chromosomes was chosen to be the\nintercept of the two Gaussian curves (2.3453) as shown\nin Figure 7. In other words, the objects will be classified\nas overlapping chromosomes whenWmaxratio is greater\nthan this selected threshold. When Wmaxratio is less\nthan or equal to the threshold, objects will be classified\nas skewed individuals. Figure 8 summarizes image para-\nmeters (see flowchart in panel A) and the proposed\nrule-based algorithm (see panel B) to classify chromo-\nsome images.\nImplementation of MetaSel\nThe proposed rule-based classification for metaphase\nselection was implemented in C# with OpenCV library.\nThis classification module was incorporated into our kar-\nyotyping software tool, called MetaSel, which was written\nfrom scratch using C# on Microsoft Windows 7 operating\nsystem. Based on the decision rules presented in Figure 8,\nthe workflow of this tool can be described as follows:\n1. Open a project folder, which contains metaphase\nspread images (Figure 9).\n2. Performing metaphase analysis by using the pro-\nposed classification rule (Figure 10).\n3. The metaphase images will be grouped into four\nclasses and ranked according to their total number\nof individual chromosomes, which is calculated by\ncombining the number of objects in Class-1 and\nClass-2 (Figure 11).\nFigure 6 Empirical and Gaussian probability density functions of the height ratio. The statistical analysis was performed to determine the\nthreshold value of the height ratio for eliminating residual objects. It can be observed that the empirical probability density function can be\napproximated by Gaussian model. From the Gaussian model, the objects are classified as residual objects whenHiratio < 0.7507. WhenHiratio ≥\n0.7507, the objects are classified as mixing between skewed objects and touching/overlapping chromosomes.\nUttamatanin et al.

The higher rank generally refers\nto better quality (analyzable) of the spread. In case of\na tie, users are strongly advised to choose the image\nthat contains more objects in Class-3. If the number\nof objects in Class-3 is equal for the tie images, the\nnumber of object in Class-4 (smaller is better) should\nbe used to break the tie.\n5. After choosing the metaphase spread image, Meta-\nSel will line up the individual chromosomes from\nClass-1, and Class-2 (Figure 12). Users can select good\nmetaphase images to later perform karyotyping.\n6. Users can go back to the original image to edit the\nambiguous chromosome images (touching/overlapping\nobjects) by cutting, merging, or fixing (make a correc-\ntion on the contour line of a chromosome image), the\nimages so that they can be karyotyped as described in\nthe previous step. (Figure 13).\nResults\nTwo hundred metaphase spreads were used to determine\nthe accuracy of the proposed rules. From these 192 meta-\nphase images, 7817-segment ed objects were obtained.\nThe processing time for 192 metaphase images was 35.52\nseconds and, hence, the average processing time for each\nimage was approximately 0.185 seconds. The accuracy of\nthis classification rule is sh o w ni nT a b l e1 .W eo b s e r v e\nthat only 0.58% of Class-1 was misclassified into Class-4.\nThis classification error occurs due to residual objects\nthat come with straight shape. Skewed individuals (Class-\n2) were misclassified as overlapping chromosomes\n(Class-3) or residual objects (Class-4). The accuracy of\nskewed individuals (Class-2) classification was 90.67%.\nSome of class-2 objects were classified into Class-3 and\nClass-4. This is because some overlapping chromosome\narrangements were similar to the banding shape and\nsome medium size residual objects.

The threshold for separating skewed individuals and overlapping chromosomes was chosen to be 2.3453\n(the intercept between the two Gaussian curves). In other words, the objects will be classified as overlapping chromosomes whenWmaxratio is greater\nthan this selected threshold. WhenWmaxratio is less than or equal to the threshold, objects will be classified as skewed individuals.\nUttamatanin et al.

We found\nthat the area ratio, the rectangle width ratio, the chromo-\nsome width ratio, maximum width ratio and height ratio\ncan be used to efficiently classify chromosome objects into\nfour classes. From our experiments, the accuracy of indivi-\ndual with straight shape and skewed individual chromo-\nsomes were 99.42% and 90.67% respectively. This study\ndemonstrated that Class-1 and Class-2 of chromosomal\nimages can be used to efficiently and accurately determine\nquality of the metaphase images. In other words, these\nclasses of chromosome can be utilized to identify analyz-\nable metaphase spreads. The processing time of chromo-\nsome classification is crucial for automated systems since\nthe systems need to process large number of images in\norder to correctly diagnosis a patient. Consequently, chro-\nmosome counting, e.g., Down ’s syndrome screening\ncan greatly benefit from our proposed chromosome classi-\nfication. In the future, we planned to integrate existing\nFigure 12 Demonstration: Classification results of input Metaphase spreads. MetaSel lined up the individual chromosomes from Class-1,\nand Class-2.
