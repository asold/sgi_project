  "abstract": "The extraction of disaster geospatial intelligence (DGI) from social media data with spatiotemporal attributes plays a crucial role in real-time disaster monitoring and emergency decision-making. However, conventional machine learning approaches struggle with semantic complexity and limited Chinese disaster corpus. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to overcome these challenges due to their enhanced semantic comprehension and multi-task learning capabilities. This study investigates the potential application of LLMs in disaster intelligence extraction and proposes an efficient, scalable method for multi-hazard DGI extraction. Building upon a unified ontological framework encompassing core natural disaster elements, this method employs parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to optimize open-source Chinese LLMs using a meticulously curated instruction-tuning dataset. It achieves simultaneous identification of multi-hazard intelligence cues and extraction of disaster spatial entity attributes from unstructured Chinese social media texts through unified semantic parsing and structured knowledge mapping. Compared to pre-trained models such as BERT and ERNIE, the proposed method was shown to achieve state-of-the-art evaluation results, with the highest recognition accuracy (F1-score: 0.9714) and the best performance in structured information generation (BLEU-4 score: 92.9649). Furthermore, we developed and released DGI-Corpus, a Chinese instruction-tuning dataset covering various disaster types, to support the research and application of LLMs in this field. Lastly, the proposed method was applied to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the Zhengzhou “7.20” flood disaster. This study enhances the efficiency of natural disaster monitoring and emergency management, offering technical support for disaster response and mitigation decision-making.",
