  "abstract": "Sensory perception of forests is closely related to human health and well-being. Based on attention recovery theory and stress relief theory, this paper investigates the influence of sensory perception of forests on visitors’ restoration effects from a multidimensional and multisensory perspective, integrating the use of a generative large language model, regression analysis, and semantic analysis. The results of the study show that (1) the application of a generative large language model provides new ideas and methods to solve the dilemma caused by the traditional self-report scale measurement and provides a possible way to explore a new research paradigm in the context of the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence; (2) the effects of each sensory quantity differed, with the sensory quantities of sight, hearing, touch, and taste having a significant positive effect on visitors’ restoration effects, and the sense of smell having a significant negative effect on visitors’ restoration effects; (3) sensory psychological distance partially had a significant effect on visitors’ restoration effects, both proximal psychological distance and distal psychological distance were significantly correlated with visitors’ restoration effects, and intermediate psychological distance had a negative effect on visitors’ restoration effects, but the effect was not significant; (4) the sensory dimension has a significant positive effect on visitors’ restoration effects, the integration and synergistic effect of the senses are enhanced, and multidimensional sensory cross-perception has a positive effect on visitors’ restoration effects at the social health level; and (5) the sensory elements of National Forest Parks that influence visitors’ restoration effects are mainly natural attributes, and the elements related to “people” also play an important role in visitors’ restoration effects. This study provides a useful complement to the study of forest sensory perception, and at the same time has an important reference value for exploring the management of forest recreation experience and sensory marketing practices.",
