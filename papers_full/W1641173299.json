    "abstract": "Implementation of the control of a Solid State Transformer (SST) is described in this paper. The SST topology considered is derived from a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC), in which the cells have the capability to transfer (inject or drain) power. The MMC is combined with an isolation stage formed by Dual Active Bridges (DABs) and a DC/AC power converter. The resulting modular multiport power converter can connect both high voltage and low voltage AC and DC ports, providing isolation between the high voltage and the low voltage terminals, and with full control of the power flow. Implementation of the control of this power converter is not trivial, due to the large amount of power devices and sensors involved, and to the complexity of the control algorithms. Furthermore, the need to provide isolation among the different stages adds further concerns mainly related with cost. This paper discusses the configuration, selection of the required hardware, as well as implementation aspects for the control of the proposed SST topology",
