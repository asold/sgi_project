An important part of the human action repertoire\nthat needs to be acquired consists of our remarkable ability to use\na wide variety of objects as a means to achieve a diverse amount of\ngoals. This unique quality of object-related (transitive) interaction\nis particularly developed in humans and involves the exposure to\nand learning of speciﬁc routines to master the correct gestures for\nfunctional object use, an ability called praxis.\n1 The neural basis of\ntool use is dramatically illustrated by the sudden deﬁcits in the pro-\nduction of learned movements in patients suffering from apraxia\nfollowing stroke. T ool perception and tool use have received a fair\nshare of attention in recent functional neuroimaging research with\nparadigms ranging from visual tool perception to actual tool use.\n1Although I realize that the words “object” and “tool” do not convey exactly the\nsame meaning, I will use them interchangeably in the manuscript. In both cases, I\nconsider them as external objects that serve a functional purpose in the transitive\naction, such as a scissors applied to cut a piece of paper or a pebble thrown to\ndemonstrate my aiming skills.\nWhat all of these paradigms seem to have in common is that they\nelicit robust neural responses in areas of the posterior parietal, pre-\nmotor, prefrontal, and posterior temporal cortices, and that this\npattern of activation is clearly lateralized to the left hemisphere\n(Johnson-Frey, 2004;Lewis, 2006). The ﬁnding that this particular\nneural activation pattern is triggered by a diversity of tool-related\ntasks and stimuli underlines the importance of tools for our brain\n(and species) and also suggests that the neural network of oper-\nations underlying tool-related behavior is highly interconnected.\nThe co-activation of distant neural regions during different types\nof tool-related tasks has obscured a detailed record of the func-\ntional role of each of these regions to tool use. In addition, the\nexpanse of the neural response in the parietal, frontal, and tempo-\nral lobes has hampered the identiﬁcation of a mosaic of specialized\nfoci within each region as well as their speciﬁc contribution to\ntransitive gestures.\nCentral to a functional transitive gesture are two other com-\nponents of upper limb behavior that have been associated with\na complex cortical organization, namely reaching and grasp-\ning. In contrast to the functional manipulation of objects,\nreaching, and grasping are readily observed in newborns and\nimprove dramatically through practice within the ﬁrst year of\nwww.frontiersin.org March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 1\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nlife. Much of the research on the neural correlates of reach-\ning and grasping has been performed on non-human primates,\nbut the emergence of neuroimaging has allowed a more ﬁne-\ngrained study in humans as well. Surprisingly, the scientiﬁc study\non reaching and grasping and the research on object and tool\nmanipulation have evolved as relatively independent ﬁelds with\nremarkably limited cross referencing in their literatures. Here,\nI will try to review the major observations on reaching, grasp-\ning, and the purposeful use of objects and tools. The focus is\non the posterior parietal lobe and the action-related sub-regions\nwithin it, and how they contribute to goal-directed visuomotor\naction.\nANATOMY OF THE POSTERIOR PARIETAL REGION\nSituated between the somatosensory cortex in the postcentral\ngyrus and the visual cortex in the occipital lobe, the posterior\nparietal cortex (PPC) is well positioned to bridge visual and\nsomatosensory input and to contribute to the sensory control\nof action via output to the frontal (pre)motor areas. Anatomi-\ncally, the lateral part of the PPC is divided in the superior and\ninferior parietal lobules separated by the intraparietal sulcus (IPS;\nFigure 1A). Anteriorly, the parietal lobules emerge out of the post-\ncentral sulcus (PoCS) and posteriorly the small parieto-occipital\nsulcus (POS) forms the lateral boundary with the occipital lobe.\nThe superior parietal lobule (SPL) consists of two cytoarchitec-\ntonically different regions, a smaller anterior Brodmann area (BA)\n5, and a larger posterior BA area 7. These BA areas extend medi-\nally into the longitudinal ﬁssure where they give rise to a similar\ndivision of the precuneus (PCu), the medial surface of the parietal\nlobe. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL) also consists of two differ-\nent cytoarchitectonical regions that by and large correspond to two\nanatomical structures, namely the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) or\nBA 40, and posterior to it, the angular gyrus (AG) or BA 39. The IPS\nseparating both lobules, is roughly about 4.5 cm long and ascends\nanteriorly from the postcentral sulcus (aIPS), runs a horizontal\ncourse over its middle segment (mIPS), and then descends caudally\n[segment called caudal IPS (cIPS)] where at its most posterior end\n(pIPS) merges with the POS. The IPS is quite deep, in some regions\nup to more than 3 cm, and a lateral (sometimes called horizon-\ntal) and medial bank are distinguished. In order to expose these\nintraparietal regions that remain concealed in a classical lateral\nview of the brain I have constructed a schematic image of the PPC\n(Figure 1B).\nAlthough our knowledge on the sensory control of action has\nbeneﬁtted a lot from macaque neurophysiology, anatomical and\nfunctional homologies of the primate brain in humans are highly\ntentative. First, the monkey’s parietal lobe is cytoarchitectonically\nquite different from ours. Macaques do not have BA ’s 39 and 40,\nrather their IPL is made up of (subdivided) BA 7, whereas their SPL\nis BA 5 (Figure 1D). In addition, their IPS consists of many spe-\ncialized regions that appear to be organized differently in human\nIPS. Second, compared to non-human primates, the magnitude\nand complexity of human tool use reﬂects a profound discontinu-\nity between us and our close relatives with regard to the cognitive\ncapacities underlying tool use (V aesen, 2012). As a consequence of\nthese important differences between species, we will focus on ﬁnd-\nings from human neuropsychology and neuroimaging, although\nwe will refer to monkey research when it comes to more basic\ncomponents of transitive gestures such as reaching and grasping.\nREACHING\nDEFINITION\nReaching can be described as the transportation of the hand to the\nobject by the upper limb\n2. Obviously, this requires an integration\nof the hand and target positions into a single reference frame,\nthus combining proprioceptive and visual information. A detailed\nreview of the vast literature on the sensorimotor integration of eye-\nhand coordination, gaze modulation, and (near) space coding is\nbeyond the scope of this contribution (Carey et al., 2002;Culham\net al., 2008). Instead, we will focus on the parietal correlates of\nsimple reaching tasks in humans.\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH\nThe classical deﬁcit associated with difﬁculties in reaching is optic\nataxia (OA). Although these patients typically do not exhibit prob-\nlems when reaching for objects in central vision and show no signs\nof motor or sensory disturbances, neglect, or apraxia, they are\nseverely impaired when reaching to targets in the peripheral visual\nﬁeld (Perenin and Vighetto, 1983,1988; Prado et al., 2005). Patients\nwith OA present with reaching errors of their contralesional hand\nin both visual ﬁelds, and also on the presentation of the object in\nthe contralesional hemiﬁeld. This hand and ﬁeld effect acknowl-\nedges the problems of visuomotor integration in OA. Recent data\nof a patient with a selective lesion in left PPC demonstrates the\nfunction speciﬁcity of OA, showing impairment of reaching (but\nnot grasping) and effector independence (disturbances of armand\nleg reaches; Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2013). Common lesion sites of\npatients with OA include the IPS and SPL. V oxel-based lesion func-\ntion mapping later contradicted the involvement of the SPL proper,\nand pointed to the parieto-occipital transition zone spanning the\nIPL, SPL, and PCu border with the superior occipital cortex instead\n(Karnath and Perenin, 2005).\nNEUROIMAGING RESEARCH\nBecause of the difﬁculty of studying arm and hand movements\nwithin the scanner bore, researchers have turned to different solu-\ntions for the viewing and motor limitations of the MR-setting.\nInstead of true reaching, some studies asked participants to ori-\nent the wrist and point with the index ﬁnger, thus eliminating\nthe transport component of the reach movement. In addition,\ntarget presentation during fMRI is classically achieved by means\nof back projection through a mirror ﬁxed to the head coil. This\narrangement, however, induces a discrepancy between the spatial\nreference frame of the movement and that of the target, and mirror\nconditions have been shown to impact neural activations patterns\nand even behavior (Binkofski et al., 2003) .S o l u t i o n sh a v eb e e n\nproposed to offer direct viewing of the target that allow for more\nnatural reaching responses (Prado et al., 2005;Beurze et al., 2007).\nBlangero et al. (2009) performed a meta-analysis on neu-\nroimaging studies of reaching to identify the relevant parietal foci\nand to compare these foci with lesion studies from OA patients.\n2Although one can also reach to a location or to a person, I will focus on reaching\ntoward an external object.

The\nmost posterior pair is located on the inferior side of the POS, a\nlocation also referred to as the parieto-occipital junction (POJ).\nThe second pair is located on the opposite (superior) bank of the\nPOS in posterior IPS (pIPS). The third pair is situated in mIPS,\nand ﬁnally, the last pair is located in aIPS, a region that is often\nassociated with grasping. It is of importance to note that reach-\ning generally elicits bilateral activation along the IPS, but that the\nhemisphere contralateral to the moving hand is substantially more\ninvolved than the ipsilateral hemisphere. In addition, Blangero\net al. (2009)were able to show that the more posterior foci (pIPS\nand POJ) displayed greater lateralization for contralateral visual\nstimulation, whereas the more anterior foci (aIPS and mIPS)\nrevealed higher lateralization for the use of the contralateral hand,\nthereby demonstrating an antero-posterior gradient of these mod-\nules to somatic-to-visual integration (V esia et al., 2010; V esia and\nCrawford, 2012). Finally, lesion overlap of 11 OA patients super-\nimposed on the parietal clusters derived from the meta-analysis\nshowed overlap with the three most posterior foci (Blangero et al.,\n2009).\nIt has proven difﬁcult to disentangle the functional contribu-\ntion of each of these regions to reaching. A popular option is to\ncompare the functional organization of monkey IPS to that of\nhumans (Culham and Kanwisher, 2001; Grefkes and Fink, 2005;\nCulham et al., 2006; V esia and Crawford, 2012). Electrophysiolog-\nical and anatomical research in the macaque revealed a mosaic\nof interconnected IPS areas that encode combinations of sen-\nsory and effector information that deﬁne their functions. Roughly,\nanterior parts are involved with sensorimotor processing and pos-\nterior parts with visual processing. In addition, neurons in the\nwww.frontiersin.org March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 3\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nFIGURE 2| Human parietal foci responsive to reaching (A) and grasping\n(B). aIPS, anterior intraparietal sulcus; aPCu, anterior precuneus; aSPL,\nanterior superior parietal lobule; cIPS, caudal intraparietal sulcus; IPL, inferior\nparietal lobule; mIPS, middle intraparietal sulcus; PCu, precuneus; pIPS,\nposterior intraparietal sulcus; POJ, parieto-occipital junction; POTZ,\nparieto-occipital transition zone; SPL, superior parietal lobule.\nmedial bank respond more to arm movements, and neurons in\nthe lateral bank are more concerned with eye movements. Neuro-\nphysiological testing of IPS neurons according to their preferences\nresulted in the differentiation of several functional regions named\nafter their anatomical location in the anterior (AIP), middle (MIP ,\nLIP), fundus (VIP), and posterior (CIP , V6 complex) portions of\nthe monkey IPS (Figure 1D). T wo of these areas seem of particular\nimportance for reaching, the V6 complex and MIP . The mon-\nkey V6 complex consists of a purely visual V6 area that receives\ninput from early visual areas and sends output to the V6A visuo-\nmotor area and MIP . T ogether with MIP , the V6 complex forms\nthe monkey parietal reach region (PRR) that makes a circuit with\nmacaque area F2, a dorsal premotor region located anterior to\nprimary motor cortex. Similar to the monkey, human pIPS and\nPOJ are on each side of the POS, making this area a likely can-\ndidate for the putative human V6 complex (Pitzalis et al., 2013).\nA recent series of experiments conﬁrmed the speciﬁc contribution\nof the human superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) for visu-\nally guided reaching (Quinlan and Culham, 2007; Culham et al.,\n2008; Filimon et al., 2009; Gallivan et al., 2009; Cavina-Pratesi\net al., 2010).\nNeuronal discharge in the macaque MIP is dependent on the\ndirection of hand movements toward a visual target and appears\ninvolved in the coordination of hand movements and visual targets\n(Johnson et al., 1996; Eskandar and Assad, 1999;Grefkes and Fink,\n2005). In humans, true reaching tasks also show increased neural\nactivity in mIPS and this region is deemed crucial for transforming\nvisual coordinates into motor programs (Grefkes et al., 2004;Gre-\nfkes and Fink, 2005;Prado et al., 2005). The association between\nvisual and motor coordinates is in line with the observation that\nthe mIPS is also robustly activated in paradigms requiring visually\nguided saccadic eye movements and may be involved in the plan-\nning of eye movements in relation to the goal that is to be achieved\n(Beurze et al., 2009;Filimon et al., 2009;Vingerhoets et al., 2010).\nFinally, the anterior bilateral IPS pair reported in theBlangero\net al. (2009)overview can be associated with monkey AIP . Situated\non the lateral bank, monkey AIP contains neurons that are highly\nselective to the size, shape, and orientation of objects, and are\nactive during ﬁxation and manipulation of objects (Grefkes and\nFink, 2005; Culham et al., 2006). Although aIPS is also activated\nduring reaching, it is more active during grasping, and we will\ndiscuss the AIP-aIPS comparison in more detail below (Culham\net al., 2003).\nWhereas most reaching related parietal activation appears to\nbe located bilaterally along the IPS, recent studies have docu-\nmented activation of superior regions within the PPC. Filimon\net al. (2009)and Filimon (2010) r e p o r t e dar e a c hs e l e c t i v ea r e ai n\nthe anterior precuneus (aPCu). This medial parietal region was\nequally active in a reaching-to-target task with the hand visible as\nin a similar (darkened) task in which the participant could not see\nhis/her hand, suggesting that aPCu is a sensorimotor region whose\nsensory input is primarily proprioceptive. This ﬁnding under-\nlines the observation that there may be multiple reach-related\nareas within the PPC with greater visual dominance in posterior\nparts, mixed responses in between, and greater or even exclu-\nsive somatosensory dominance in anterior PPC regions (Filimon,\n2010). Cavina-Pratesi et al. (2010) reported, besides the already\nmentioned SPOC, also activation in the rostral SPL during a task\nthat manipulated the transport component by positioning the tar-\nget in a far or near location. A recent neuroimaging study that\ndirectly compared reaching and grasping movements reported a\nfunctional gradient of speciﬁcity with grasp-speciﬁc regions being\nlocated in the left anterior IPS extending in the PoCS, regions\nalong the IPS showing activation during reaching and grasping\nmovements, and reach- speciﬁc activation in the left PCu and SPL\n(Konen et al., 2013). T ogether, these data suggest that in compari-\nson to tasks involving object grasping or manipulation (see below),\nreaching without grasping activates more dorsal and medial parts\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 4\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nof the PPC (Filimon et al., 2007;Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2010; Konen\net al., 2013).\nOBSERVATION AND IMAGERY OF REACHING\nOnly few studies investigated the observation and/or mental sim-\nulation of reaching movements. Compared to passive viewing\nof objects (baseline), observed reaching and imagined reaching\nactivated the IPS, SPL, and PCu ( Filimon et al., 2007). Imag-\nined reaching also included SMG activation. In both conditions\nleft hemispheric activations were much stronger as these right\nhanded volunteers observed/imaged the reaching tasks with the\nright hand. Signiﬁcant overlap between activations during exe-\ncuted, observed and imagined reaching was found in the left\nmedial IPS and the left SPL extending medially into the supe-\nrior PCu. The contrast between observed and imagined reaching\nshowed no difference in parietal activation suggesting an equal\nneural response in observation and imagery of reaching (Filimon\net al., 2007).\nGRASPING\nDEFINITION\nWhereas reaching requires correspondence between the spatial\nlocation of hand and target, grasping is focused on another visuo-\nmotor match, namely the correspondence between the object’s\nform and the hand’s posture. Grasping requires the extraction of\nvisual features of an object, such as its size, shape, orientation, tex-\nture, and estimated weight in order to properly preshape the hand\nduring the approach, adjust grasping speed during contact, and\nclose the ﬁngers around the object applying the correct grip force.\nAlthough reaching and grasping can be distinguished conceptually,\nin practice they form a continuum as revealed by the kinematics\nof a reach-and-grasp movement showing adaptation of the grip\naperture during the reaching phase of the gesture (Jeannerod et al.,\n1995; Castiello, 2005). The close relation between the transport\nand grip components of prehension make it difﬁcult to separate\nthe neural correlates underlying each component. As a result, sev-\neral areas are activated during reaching and grasping, although\noften a preference in responsiveness to reaching or grasping can\nbe observed.\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH\nBinkofski et al. (1998)performed a lesion analysis in nine patients\nwith parietal lesions who showed no or only minor visuomotor\ndifﬁculties and underwent kinematic analysis during reach-and-\ngrasp movements. Patients showing kinematic deﬁcits (n = 5) all\nrevealed lesions in the lateral bank of the aIPS, whereas in patients\nshowing normal grasping this region was spared. Kinematics fur-\nther revealed that the deﬁcit was more pronounced for grasping\nthan for reaching, and especially affected the contralesional hand.\nT o the best of my knowledge, this is the only study that investigated\ngrasping in a clinical population with parietal lesions.\nNEUROIMAGING RESEARCH\nSimilar to reaching, the technical limitations of the scanner have\ninﬂuenced the ecological validity of the grasping paradigms used.\nAs grasping involves objects and movement – two well known\nsources of artifacts during MR-data acquisition – researchers have\nused pantomimed grasping (no object) or imagined grasping (no\nobject, no movement) instead. Again, these are rather unnatu-\nral, or at least uncommon, tasks that question the validity of\nthese paradigms’ claims on the neural representation underlying\nreal grasping. Fortunately, methodological and technical solu-\ntions have been presented over the last few years that allow a\nmore natural setup within the scanner environment (Culham et al.,\n2006).\nData from neuroimaging studies have conﬁrmed the impor-\ntance of the junction between the PoCS and the aIPS for human\ngrasping (Figure 2B; Grafton et al., 1996b; Culham et al., 2003;\nShikata et al., 2003; Frey et al., 2005; Pierno et al., 2009). The cor-\ntex in this region is considered to be part of the IPL. As described\nabove, the region also responds to reaching movements, but its\nresponse to grasping is generally stronger (Culham et al., 2003 ,\n2006). Similar to non-human primates, the aIPS is activated by\nvisually guided grasping, object manipulation without vision, and\nvisual inspection without grasping ( Culham et al., 2006). The\nlatter effect is only achieved when 3D objects are presented or\nwhen 2D pictures of objects with particular hand associations\nare shown, such as tools (Chao and Martin, 2000; Culham et al.,\n2003; Creem-Regehr and Lee, 2005). Pure perceptual processing\nof object features unrelated to grasping does not activate aIPS\n(Culham et al., 2003). Grasping with either hand evokes bilat-\neral aIPS activity, but the extent and magnitude of the activation\nis much larger in the aIPS contralateral to the hand used and\nappears inﬂuenced by handedness (Culham and Kanwisher, 2001;\nCulham et al., 2003; Begliomini et al., 2008). Finally, TMS applied\nto the left aIPS (but not mIPS or cIPS) disrupts on-line grasping\nexecution (Rice et al., 2006), and selectively results in impaired\njudgments of tool-related grip conﬁgurations in right handers\n(Andres et al., 2013). W orld-wide replications of anterior IPS acti-\nvation during grasping paradigms in humans and macaques result\nin a growing consensus that human aIPS is the most likely func-\ntional equivalent of monkey AIP . In humans, the role of the aIPS\nregion has also been extended to higher-order motor functions\nas it appeared involved with action planning, recognition of goal-\ndirected hand-object movements, and motor semantics (Shmuelof\nand Zohary, 2005; T unik et al., 2005, 2007, 2008b; Hamilton\nand Grafton, 2006; Ortigue et al., 2009; Vingerhoets et al., 2009a;\nCross et al., 2012).\nMacaque AIP forms a circuit with macaque F5, the rostral part\nof the monkey ventral premotor cortex (vPM) which, in turn,\nprojects to the hand region of the primary cortex F1 (Jeannerod\net al., 1995). Inactivation of either the monkey AIP or F5 area\ngives rise to impaired hand shaping relative to the object’s features\n(Gallese et al., 1994; Fogassi et al., 2001). It was suggested that\nAIP uses visual input to highlight grasp-relevant object features\nand that F5 uses this information to select the most appropri-\nate grasp. Continuous feedback between both regions monitors\nthe ensuing grasp movement ( Fagg and Arbib, 1998 ). A simi-\nlar fronto-parietal link has been proposed in humans, linking\naIPS with the putative human homologue of monkey F5, the\npars opercularis, the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus,\nalso known as the vPM or Broca’s region (Figure 1C). Recent\nneuroimaging studies have corroborated this idea ( T unik et al.,\n2005; Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2010; Gallivan et al., 2011; Makuuchi\nwww.frontiersin.org March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 5\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\net al., 2012; Vingerhoets et al., 2013b). As in the monkey F5 region,\nvPM in humans is modulated by grip type, in particular precision\ngrips (Ehrsson et al., 2000, 2001). But also aIPS shows selective\nresponses to different hand conﬁgurations. Multivariate pattern\nclassiﬁcation analysis of BOLD responses during a rock-paper-\nscissors game was able to accurately classify the pattern of aIPS\nactivity unique to each hand movement ( Dinstein et al., 2008).\nAccurate classiﬁcation was obtained within modality (either dur-\ning observation or execution), but not between modalities, leading\nthe authors to suggest that observed and executed movements\nmay be represented by different subpopulations of neurons within\naIPS (Dinstein et al., 2008). Although this study investigated hand\nmovements (postures) rather than grasps, these results disclose\nthe central role of aIPS in the perception and execution of hand\nconﬁgurations.\nGrasping also elicits activation in other parietal regions besides\naIPS. Activation during visually guided grasping was reported in\nthe posterior section of IPS ( Culham et al., 2003). In order to\nexplain the pIPS activation during grasping, another comparison\nwith the monkey brain appears relevant. Macaque CIP is situ-\nated in the lateral bank of caudal IPS and appears involved in the\nanalysis of object features such as surface texture and orientation\n(Figure 1D). It is believed to analyze the 3D shape and orienta-\ntion of objects by integrating binocular and monocular depth cues\nand feed this to the grasping area AIP (Sakata et al., 1998; T sutsui\net al., 2003; Grefkes and Fink, 2005). In humans, caudal activation\nin the medial bank of IPS was uncovered in a surface orienta-\ntion discrimination task (Faillenot et al., 1999; Shikata et al., 2001,\n2003).\nA second parietal region linked with aIPS during grasping lies\nin SPL (T unik et al., 2008b). T unik et al. (2008b)had right handed\nparticipants grasp target objects that could or could not undergo\nrotation after the initiation of the reach and grasp movement.\nElectrophysiological recordings of evoked brain responses revealed\na two-stage process. Response duration in a ﬁrst stage activated left\naIPS region and was longer when there was an object perturbation,\nwhereas initiation of the corrective movement coincided with SPL\nactivity. The authors suggested that aIPS is involved in the initial\nstate activation and the emerging action plan. With increasing\ndiscrepancy between the desired and actual state, aIPS activation\nis prolonged to initiate corrections that are mediated in part by the\nSPL (T unik et al., 2008b).\nOBSERVATION AND IMAGERY OF GRASPING\nObserved and imagined grasping actions have been studied fre-\nquently with neuroimaging as they require no actual movements in\nthe scanner. Based on the temporal coupling between executed and\nimagined movements a similarity, in neural terms, was expected\nbetween the state where an action is simulated and the state of exe-\ncution of that action (Jeannerod, 2001). In monkeys an extensive\noverlap of parietal networks activated during grasp execution and\ngrasp observation have been established (Evangeliou et al., 2009).\nMost studies on imagined grasping in humans indeed reported\nsimilar activation of the IPS, SPL, and IPL areas compared to exe-\ncuted grasping (Decety et al., 1994; Grafton et al., 1996a;Binkofski\net al., 1999; Grezes and Decety, 2002 ). Also the observation of\ngrasping actions is believed to elicit the same mechanisms in the\nobserver’s brain that would be activated were that action intended\nby the observer. This prediction was conﬁrmed by several neu-\nroimaging studies that compared observed versus executed object\ngrasping (Grafton et al., 1996a;Buccino et al., 2001; Grezes et al.,\n2003a). A recent study required volunteers to judge videos of tran-\nsitive reach and grasp gestures and decide whether the object was\ngrasped with the intention to use or to displace. Discrimination of\naction intention during observed grasping revealed bilateral acti-\nvation of aIPS, mIPS, and cIPS foci suggesting that regions very\nsimilar to those involved with executed grasping are recruited by\nthe observer to determine the purpose of the grasp (Vingerhoets\net al., 2010). Lateralization of the posterior parietal activation\nduring observed grasping, in particular of the aIPS, appears inﬂu-\nenced by the observer’s perspective. In a ﬁrst-person perspective,\nanatomical congruence is observed showing contralateral activa-\ntion to the modeled hand. In third-person viewpoint, specular or\nspatial congruence is seen with parietal activation ipsilateral to the\nmodeled hand (Shmuelof and Zohary, 2008 ; Vingerhoets et al.,\n2012b).\nINTEGRATION OF REACHING AND GRASPING\nAlthough the transport and grip components of a transitive ges-\nture can be separated conceptually, in everyday life they present as\na single ﬂuid action. Much of the research thus far has strived\ntoward the study of one single component as if reaching and\ngrasping were completely independent. As shown above, sup-\nporting evidence from neuropsychology and neuroimaging indeed\npoints to a aIPS – vPM circuit (also termed the dorsolateral cir-\ncuit) relevant for grasping that can be distinguished from a POTZ\n(SPOC)/mIPS – dPM circuit (the dorsomedial circuit) underly-\ning reaching (Figure 1C). Novel paradigms combining reaching\nand grasping uncovered brain regions (supplementary motor area,\nSMA and dPM) that seem to be active during both compo-\nnents and may be relevant for the coordination of reach and\ngrasp (Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2010). In addition and adding to the\nobservations reported above (T unik et al., 2008b), recent evidence\nsuggests that the aIPS centered dorsolateral circuit and the supe-\nrior POS centered dorsomedial network appear to specify the same\ngrasping parameters but are temporarily dependent on each other,\nand thus seem to be organized in a hierarchical manner (V erhagen\net al., 2013).\nUSING\nDEFINITION\nT ransitive movements are performed with a purpose. The purpose\nof the interaction dictates how we will grasp and manipulate an\nobject. This is very obvious when we interact with tool objects.\nManipulating a pair of scissors to cut a piece of paper for example,\nis quite different from the gestures required to move the scissors\nfrom the desktop to the drawer. But goal-directed differences are\nalso observed when we interact with objects that have no particular\nfunction; the way I will pick up a stick to throw it away for my dog\nto fetch is different from the movements I use to move the stick out\nof the way (Ansuini et al., 2006, 2008). Using an object for a par-\nticular purpose requires the generation of an action plan. Usually,\nthis plan is already present during the reach and grasp components\nof the transitive action. T op-down motor planning in grasping is\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 6\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nnicely demonstrated by the end-state comfort effect, the tendency\nof people to adaptively structure their initial grasp in order to\nend up with a comfortable posture for the intended action, even\nwhen this necessitates them to use an awkward grasp at the start\nof the movement (Rosenbaum et al., 1992, 1996). When grasping\na cup that is upside down, we would use a different grip when we\nwant to pour tea in it compared to placing it in the dishwasher.\nBehavioral research has provided support for a left hemisphere\ndominance in the motor planning of end-state comfort effects in\nright and left handers (Janssen et al., 2011). It remains a matter of\ndebate whether the planning of reach and grasp actions for object\nuse versus object transport are guided by different mechanisms\n(Osiurak et al., 2008). In addition to reach-and-grasp planning,\nwe also must recall and apply the appropriate object-related\nmovements to achieve the planned goal. Again, the different\ncomponents of the transitive action, reaching, grasping, and\nusing, are closely intertwined, and difﬁcult to separate in natural\naction.\nPurposeful behavior with objects can be assessed in a variety\nof ways, of which the actual use of tools appears to be the most\necological method. But other approaches have been fruitful too.\nClinical work revealed thatpantomiming tool use is a more sensi-\ntive method to elicit symptoms of apraxia, as patients are unable\nto rely on the physical properties of the tool that may afford tool-\nrelated gestures (Randerath et al., 2011). Imagingthe use of tools\nhas been applied to make abstraction of the actual movements and\ninvestigate the neural and behavioral correlates of motor imagery.\nFinally, researchers have also investigated thereceptive, rather than\nproductive aspects of tool use by having participants observe actual\nor pantomimed tool-related behavior performed by others. Motor\nimagery and action observation are sometimes referred to as action\nsimulation states or S-states, because they appear to be based on the\nactivation of the brain’s motor system, yet in contrast to actual or\npantomimed movements, they require no execution of the motor\naction (Jeannerod, 2001). W e will offer an overview of the most\nrelevant ﬁndings for each of these tasks below.\nPRODUCTIVE PARIETAL RESPONSES OF TRANSITIVE GESTURES\nActual use of objects and tools\nNeuropsychological research.Misuse of everyday tools and objects\nis one of the three categories of symptoms that qualify for the\ndiagnosis of apraxia {the other two being dysfunctions in the imi-\ntation of gestures and the production of communicative gestures\n[symbolic gestures (also called emblems) or pantomimes] respec-\ntively; Goldenberg, 2008, 2009}. Apraxia occurs predominantly\nfollowing left brain lesions and affects both sides of the body,\nnot just the (often hemiplegic) contralesional side. Patients with\napraxia may present with multiple or just one of the core symp-\ntoms indicating that apraxia is not a unitary disorder and that the\ndifferent symptoms rely on a (partially) different neural represen-\ntation. Clinical neuropsychology has traditionally associated limb\napraxia with left parietal dysfunction. In particular the left IPL\nand IPS region are assumed to store knowledge about hand and\nﬁnger postures/movements required for the use of tools (Sirigu\net al., 1995; Haaland et al., 2000; Buxbaum et al., 2003, 2007),\nbut also see (Schnider et al., 1997). AlthoughGoldenberg (2009)\nclaimed that no clear relation between defective actual tool use\nand left parietal lesions has been established, other than a num-\nber of case studies, his voxel-wise lesion-function study revealed\nselective impairment on certain tool tasks following parietal dam-\nage (Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009). In this studyGoldenberg and\nSpatt (2009) investigated 38 patients with left brain damage on\nsemantic tool knowledge, mechanical problem solving, and use\nof familiar tools and objects. Parietal lesions, in particular of\nthe IPL and SMG, interfered with the latter two tasks, but not\nwith semantic tool knowledge. The authors concluded that the\nparietal lobe’s role concerns general principles of tool use and com-\nprehension of mechanical interactions, rather than prototypical\ntool use gestures or the selection of grip formations (Goldenberg\nand Spatt, 2009). A related observation of a dissociation between\nfunctional object knowledge (action semantics) and mechanical\nproblem solving skills has been voiced earlier (Hodges et al., 1999).\nPatients with semantic dementia and temporal atrophy showed\nimpaired object identiﬁcation and functional semantics and dis-\nplayed markedly impaired use of familiar objects, yet retained\nmechanical problem solving ability as demonstrated in a novel\ntool task and the correct use of familiar objects with obvious\nstructure-function relationships (Hodges et al., 2000). In contrast,\na patient with corticobasal degeneration and biparietal atrophy\ndemonstrated impaired mechanical problem solving and common\ntool use despite near normal semantic knowledge about the tool’s\nfunction (Hodges et al., 1999). It appeared to the authors that\nobject-speciﬁc conceptual knowledge is crucial for object use, and\nmay be supplemented to some degree by sensory input of object\naffordances into a parietal “how” system that may trigger mechan-\nical reasoning and the correct use of (some) objects (Hodges et al.,\n1999, 2000). Later research challenged this view by presenting two\npatients with degraded semantic knowledge (including functional\nobject knowledge), who showed preserved object use over a two-\nyear follow-up (Negri et al., 2007). The existence of a separate\nrepresentation of semantic and kinematic/motor knowledge of\nfunctional object use in the brain thus remains to be elucidated.\nNeuroimaging research. Given the limitations for tool interaction\nin the scanner environment, only a handful of fMRI studies exam-\nined actual tool use in humans. Their paradigms compared real\ntool manipulation against pantomimed or imagined use, or both.\nIn general, the tasks produced widespread activation in parietal,\nposterior temporal, frontal, and subcortical regions. W e will again\nfocus on speciﬁc task differences within the parietal region. One\nstudy investigated the actual, pantomimed, and imagined right\nhand use of chop sticks ( Imazu et al., 2007). Compared to the\npantomimed performance, actual chop stick use showed increased\nparietal activation in the left PoCG and right IPL (BA 40). Another\nstudy compared the actual use of 16 common tools or their imag-\nined use with a control condition without mental task (Higuchi\net al., 2007). In the latter two conditions participants were allowed\nto hold the tools. Actual use revealed unique activity in the left\npostcentral gyrus and shared activity with the imagery task in\nleft pIPS compared to the control task. A third study compared\npantomimed and actual use of 32 familiar objects during a presen-\ntation phase, a preparation phase, and an execution phase during\nwhich they were either handed the tool for actual use, or were\nrequired to pantomime its use (Hermsdörfer et al., 2007). During\nwww.frontiersin.org March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 7\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nthe execution phase, actual tool use revealed increased activation\nin left PoCG, and bilateral SPL and IPL (BA 40).\nAs expected, all studies report increased activation during\nactual tool use over the left primary somatosensory region (PoCG,\nFigure 3). Modulation of several bilateral posterior parietal\nregions is also reported, but there is little consensus regarding a\nspeciﬁc location which is probably due to substantial methodolog-\nical differences between studies. The additional somatosensory\nmodulation during real tool manipulation suggests that the phys-\nical demands of the object may serve as cues during actual\nperformance and might explain why apraxic patients perform typ-\nically better during actual tool use than during pantomimed tool\nuse (Laimgruber et al., 2005;Hermsdörfer et al., 2006; Randerath\net al., 2011).\nAnother interesting approach compared the neural activation\nin healthy right handers during the manipulation of a small object\nwith a pair of tongs or with the ﬁngers (Inoue et al., 2001). The PET\nstudy revealed that when volunteers used their dominant hand, the\nleft aIPS was activated similarly in the tool and ﬁngers condition,\nbut in the tool condition an additional region in the ipsilateral\n(right) posterior IPL/IPS became active. The authors interpreted\nthis region to be involved in the integration of visuosomatosen-\nsory information during the use of a tool as required during the\nincorporation of an external object into the body schema (Inoue\net al., 2001; Maravita and Iriki, 2004).\nPantomimed use of objects and tools\nNeuropsychological research.The crucial difference between pan-\ntomimed versus actual use of a tool is that the former has to be\nmentally elaborated and stored in the absence of an external image\nof the object and the hand acting on it. In other words, it is a cre-\native process that cannot rely on the physical cues provided by the\naction scene. Movement kinematics of actual versus pantomimed\nprehensile actions demonstrated qualitative differences between\nboth tasks in apraxic patients and healthy controls (Laimgruber\net al., 2005; Hermsdörfer et al., 2006). Apparently, patients with\napraxia experience difﬁculties with the absence of the mechani-\ncal affordances and constraints of real tools and objects as their\nperformance during naturalistic execution is often superior to\ntheir pantomiming of similar actions (Goldenberg and Hagmann,\n1998; Buxbaum et al., 2000; W estwood et al., 2001; Goldenberg\net al., 2004). Similar to actual tool use, the involvement of parietal\nlesions with deﬁcits in pantomiming meaningful gestures on ver-\nbal command is mainly supported by single case observations, but\nnot corroborated by lesion studies (Goldenberg et al., 2003, 2007;\nGoldenberg, 2009). The lack of a clear relationship between left\nparietal lesions and tool use pantomiming, and a somewhat more\nconvincing (though not absolute) relation of parietal damage with\ndeﬁcits in actual tool use and imitation of meaningless gestures,\nhad led Goldenberg to the question of what the latter tasks have\nin common. Goldenberg proposes that tool use and imitation of\nmeaningless gestures rely on the categorical apprehension of spa-\ntial relationships between body parts, tools, and objects. Rather\nthan a repository for the representation of motor acts, the pari-\netal lobe acts to spatially conﬁgure multiple (parts of) objects,\nthat may be body parts, external objects, or both ( Goldenberg,\n2009).\nNeuroimaging research. In contrast to the limited evidence of\na relation between parietal lesions and pantomime dysfunction,\nmost (if not all) of the neuroimaging studies using pantomime\nparadigms reported robust posterior parietal activation in their\nhealthy subjects. One of the ﬁrst studies compared tool use\npantomimes versus a non-symbolic gesture sequence and found\npredominant left IPS activation ( Moll et al., 2000). Choi et al.\n(2001) compared left and right hand tool pantomiming against\na motor control task and demonstrated dominant left parietal\nactivation with either effector. T ool pantomiming resulted in\nactivation of the SPL (BA 7) and SMG (BA 40), with stronger\nactivation in the former (Choi et al., 2001). Rumiati et al. (2004)\nused PET in a paradigm that controlled for perceptual, seman-\ntic, and sensorimotor aspects to reveal that skilled pantomimes\nelicited parietal activation in two left IPL foci. The more dor-\nsal and posterior one is particularly responsive to pantomiming\ntriggered by object stimuli, whereas their more ventral IPL focus\nwas also active during imitation of pantomimes and was taken\nby the authors to be associated with tool grasping (Rumiati et al.,\n2004). Ordinary tool pantomimes and body-part-as-object ges-\ntures showed left SPL (BA 7) and SMG (BA 40) activity irrespective\nof the hand used in the study ofOhgami et al. (2004). Body-part-\nas-object gestures additionally activated the right SMG (Ohgami\net al., 2004). Johnson-Frey et al. (2005) compared the planning\nand execution of tool use gestures with either hand against a\nmovement control task. For either limb planning tool use pan-\ntomimes activated two left parietal foci in the IPL, one more\nanterior and inferior in SMG, another more superior and pos-\nterior in SMG extending to AG (Johnson-Frey et al., 2005). The\nauthors noted that the anterior focus did not match with the puta-\ntive human AIP coordinates derived from human grasping studies,\nand suggested that representations of tool manipulation are stored\nin a separate region, that is near to, but not identical with the\narea involved in computing sensorimotor transformations dur-\ning grasping. Johnson-Frey et al. (2005)further hypothesize that\ntheir posterior parietal SMG/AG site is involved in the represen-\ntation of motor programs for acquired tool use skills.Imazu et al.\n(2007) found increased activity in the left IPL (BA 40) during pan-\ntomimed compared to actual chop stick use. ROI-analysis over\nthe left parietal region also revealed an IPL focus of the pan-\ntomime versus actual use contrast in theHermsdörfer et al. (2007)\nand suggested that this region may be necessary for pantomim-\ning, but unnecessary when sensorimotor feedback is available\n(Hermsdörfer et al., 2007). Kroliczak and Frey (2009)investigated\ntool pantomime versus a linguistic control task. T wo left IPL foci\nappeared to be independent of the hand used to prepare the pan-\ntomime. A ﬁrst was positioned dorsal and posterior in the IPS, the\nsecond more ventral and anterior in the SMG. Three recent studies\nby Vingerhoets et al.(2011, 2012a, 2013a) investigated pantomim-\ning of familiar tools to explore action semantics and the effects of\nhandedness and atypical language lateralization respectively. In a\nﬁrst study, a distinction was made between execution and planning\nof tool pantomimes controlled for non tool transitive movements.\nExecution of familiar tool pantomimes bilaterally modulated SPL\nand two foci within IPL. The more dorsal focus lies in the superior\npart of SMG, whereas the ventral focus is located in the part of\nthe SMG that descends into the lateral ﬁssure (Vingerhoets et al.,\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 8\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\n2011). A hand-independent paradigm comparing tool pantomim-\ning versus control gestures was used in two other studies that\nevaluated neural lateralization effects due to hand preference and\nlanguage dominance respectively. T ool pantomimes elicited robust\nleft parietal activation regardless of handedness and hand-effector,\nalthough lateralization in the parietal region was stronger in right\nhanders compared to left handers (Vingerhoets et al., 2012a). T yp-\nical (left) language dominant volunteers exhibited activation in\nthe left PoCG, PCu, and two SMG foci that appeared switched to\nhomologous regions in the right hemispheres in participants with\natypical (right) language dominance (Vingerhoets et al., 2013a).\nWhat most of the studies investigating tool pantomiming in\nnormal volunteers seem to have in common is the activation of\none or both of two foci in the left SMG that appear to differ along\na superior/inferior and anterior/posterior dimension (Figure 3).\nA summary of the peak coordinates grouped along these dimen-\nsions is provided inTa b l e 1. W e only listed peak voxel coordinates\nif provided by the studies, and if in the IPL (the SMG coordi-\nn a t er e p o r t e db yChoi et al., 2001for example is not even near\nSMG). MNI coordinates were Lancaster-transformed to T alairach\ncoordinates if necessary and vice versa ( Lancaster et al., 2007).\nCoordinates were ordered along the Z-axis with more superior\npeak voxels on top. If you now look at the Y -axis T alairach\ncoordinates, you see that in the upper part of the table most\nY -coordinates are close to 45 (indicated in blue), whereas in the\nlower part they are more close to 35 (indicated in green). T wo\noutliers, indicated in red, were not used in calculating the mean\ncoordinates of both foci. The more superior and posterior focus of\nFIGURE 3| Human parietal foci responsive during different\nmanifestations of tool use.AG, angular gyrus; iaSMG, inferior anterior\nsupramarginal gyrus; IPS, intraparietal sulcus; PCu, precuneus; PoCG,\npostcentral gyrus; pSPL, posterior superior parietal lobule; spSMG, superior\nposterior supramarginal gyrus.\nthe two (−42,−46, 48, T alairach coordinate) is positioned on the\nconvex portion of the posterior part of the SMG. Its activation has\nbeen attributed to the triggering of object-related action schemata\nin humans (Rumiati et al., 2004), the representation of motor pro-\ngrams for acquired tool use skills (Johnson-Frey et al., 2005), and\nthe production of object manipulation without sensory feedback\n(Imazu et al., 2007). The more inferior and anterior focus (−53,\n−33, 31, T alairach coordinate) is located on the ventral part of the\nSMG were the gyrus descends in the lateral ﬁssure. This focus has\nbeen related to tool use and grasping in particular (Rumiati et al.,\n2004), and appears active during both planned and executed ges-\ntures (Johnson-Frey et al., 2005;Hermsdörfer et al., 2007). Despite\nits anterior position, this anterior SMG focus is not similar to the\naIPS, the prototypical region underlying grasp formation (T unik\net al., 2007). T unik et al. (2007)listed 22 coordinates of human\naIPS in grasping studies and calculated the mean coordinates for\nthe left and right hemisphere (−40, −39, 43 on the left, indicated in\nbrown in Ta b l e 1, and 41,−40, 45 on the right). Clearly, the ante-\nrior SMG focus found in tool pantomime studies lies inferior and\nlateral to this region. In addition, tool pantomime neuroimaging\nstudies show robust left lateralized activation, irrespective of the\nhand used, which is fundamentally different from the more robust\ncontralateral aIPS activation that depends on the hand performing\nthe grasping movement. T aken together, these results suggest that\ntool use pantomiming elicits activation in left hemispheric ante-\nrior and posterior SMG foci that can be distinguished from the\nprototypical grasp formation aIPS locus. Given the diverse inter-\npretations, it is difﬁcult to speculate on the role of these different\nfoci. The left anterior SMG focus may seem to be particularly tuned\nto the grasping of familiar objects (compared to unknown objects\nor shapes), but this was not conﬁrmed in a study that explicitly\ntested this assumption and in fact revealed more posterior SMG\nactivation for such a contrast (Vingerhoets et al., 2009a). The only\ncontrast that demonstrated modulation of the anterior SMG in the\nlatter study was when participants had to imagine displacing famil-\niar versus unfamiliar tools (−58,−23, 33, T alairach coordinate),\nsuggesting that this region may indeed be object-speciﬁc, but not\nparticularly tuned to functional prehension ( Vingerhoets et al.,\n2009a). An alternative explanation may be found in a transcra-\nnial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study during planning of grasp\nactions (T unik et al., 2008a). These researchers administered TMS\nover left SMG during goal speciﬁc grasping movements toward a\nfamiliar object (a cup placed upside down) with the intent to use\nor to move the object. Although no speciﬁc site coordinates were\nprovided, the SMG focus illustrated in their ﬁgure lies inferior and\nanterior to the aIPS focus (another TMS target in their study) and\nthus seems to coincide with a more anterior SMG location. Stim-\nulation to SMG (but not aIPS) during the planning phase of the\naction signiﬁcantly delayed the goal-oriented actions, although\nthe execution of arbitrary stimulus-response mappings was not\naffected. Based on these and previous data, T unik et al. (2008a)\nargued that SMG may be involved in goal-oriented formation of\nplans and selection of actions (planning of actions), whereas aIPS\nmay be responsible for monitoring the ﬁt between hand-object\ninteractions and its intended outcome (guidance of actions).\nMore recently, and partially based on diffusion tensor imaging to\nidentify connections between tool-relevant brain regions, it was\nwww.frontiersin.org March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 9\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nT able 1| Inferior parietal lobule foci reported in pantomime studies.\nStudy Contrast Side Location X (tal) Y (tal) Z (tal) X (mni) Y (mni) Z (mni)\nJohnson-Frey et al.

T aken\ntogether, the anterior SMG region may be involved in goal-\nspeciﬁc movement planning toward tool-like objects, but more\nspeciﬁc research is needed to corroborate this idea. There is more\nconsensus on the role of the posterior SMG subserving func-\ntional motor schemata for familiar objects. The imagined use\nof familiar tools repeatedly demonstrated increased activation\nin the left posterior SMG region when compared to imag-\nined displacement of tools (familiar and unfamiliar) or shapes\n(Vingerhoets et al., 2009a).\nWhy is this robust left IPL activation during tool use pan-\ntomime in healthy participants not reﬂected in a clear cut relation\nbetween parietal lesions and pantomime dysfunction?Goldenberg\n(2009) suggests that the unusual position and awkward visual and\nspatial context of the participant during imaging studies may give\nrise to additional spatial demands that induce this parietal activa-\ntion. It can be argued that this possible confound would not hold\nfor planned or imagined pantomimes, and that the latter tasks nev-\nertheless reveal signiﬁcant left IPL activity. An alternative explana-\ntion may be that a left parietal lesion often does not sufﬁce to elicit\ndeﬁcient pantomiming. Although the left PPC may be involved in\nthe initiation and control of motor schemata for pantomiming the\nuse of familiar objects, the existence of multiple and potentially\nredundant left parietal foci, and the modulation of right parietal\nregions during the pantomiming of familiar and unfamiliar tools\nhints at the availability of compensatory mechanisms (Vingerhoets\net al., 2011). Additional frontal or white matter damage may be\nrequired to disrupt the execution of the (sub-optimal) pantomime\nplan.\nImagined use of objects and tools\nImagined tool use is a strategy used in some neuroimaging stud-\nies to avoid possible noise of overt movements in the magnet or\nto explore the neural correlates of mental imagery. The draw-\nback of imagined gestures is of course a lack of performance and\ncompliance data, although the temporal coupling between imag-\nined and executed movements can be used for a timed estimation\nof the imagery performance (Vingerhoets et al., 2009a). In addi-\ntion, it is unclear how “imagined tool use” differs from “planned\npantomime, ” an approach that introduces a delay period between\nstimulus presentation and the execution command (Johnson-Frey\net al., 2005; Kroliczak and Frey, 2009). During the delay period\nparticipants are required to prepare the instructed gesture, but it\nis unclear whether this required keeping the task active in working\nmemory or to imagine its execution. Here, I will focus on studies\nthat explicitly requested imagined tool use.\nImazu et al. (2007) found increased activity in the left IPL\n(BA 40) during imagined and executed pantomimes compared\nto actual chop stick use. They suggested that this left IPL focus\nwas involved in the explicit retrieval and production of grasp-\ning and manipulation of objects without sensory feedback.Moll\net al. (2000)reported IPS patterns of activation during imagined\ntool-use performance (versus an imagined control motor task)\nthat were identical to those during a similar pantomimed con-\ntrast. Vingerhoets et al. (2009a)compared the parietal activation\nduring imagined use versus imagined displacement of the same\ntools and uncovered activation in left SPL extending to mIPS and\naIPS. Unfortunately this study only compared different manipu-\nlations of target objects and tasks, it did not include a condition\nwith executed pantomimes. Interestingly, a very strict conjunc-\ntion analysis aimed to reveal voxels that are activated while using\na familiar tool (in imagination) while correcting for differences\nin object qualities or non-functional aspects of reach-and-grasp\nmovements, detected signiﬁcant activity on the convex border\nof the left SPL/SMG in a region that is very close to the poste-\nrior SMG focus described in the pantomime section (Vingerhoets\net al., 2009a). Again, this ﬁnding conﬁrms the involvement of the\nposterior SMG region for the representation of motor schemata\nfor the functional use of tools. The few studies on imagined\n(rather than executed) pantomimes seem to indicate that imag-\ning tool use produces activation in the same regions that are active\nduring the real pantomiming of tool use, conﬁrming the close\nneural match between motor imagery and executed movement\n(Jeannerod, 2001;Kosslyn et al., 2001).\nRECEPTIVE PARIETAL RESPONSES OF TRANSITIVE GESTURES\nObserved actual use of objects and tools\nViewing tool objects facilitates motor responses that are com-\npatible with its manipulation (Humphreys, 2001). The object is\nbelieved to possess affordances, properties that are relevant for\nits use and potentiate associated motor actions ( Gibson, 1979).\nEffects of action priming or motor affordances have been described\nin particular for physical object properties such as its size or spa-\ntial orientation (T ucker and Ellis, 1998, 2001; Phillips and W ard,\n2002; Grezes et al., 2003b; Vingerhoets et al., 2009b). As tools,\nin contrast to most other classes of objects, are able to activate\ncortical areas associated with motor functions, action priming is\nbelieved to result from the neural activation elicited by the tool\nobject that partially overlaps with regions involved with actual\ntool use (Decety et al., 1997; Chao and Martin, 2000; Grezes and\nDecety, 2002; Grezes et al., 2003b; Creem-Regehr and Lee, 2005;\nLewis, 2006; Vingerhoets, 2008). Here, we will focus on the neu-\nral correlates of observed tool use, rather than of static images of\ntools. A meta-analysis of the neural patterns of execution, sim-\nulation of execution, and observed execution of actions revealed\nclear overlap in SMG and SPL, among other extraparietal motor-\nrelated regions (Grezes and Decety, 2001). Other studies reported\nstrong activation of the aIPS and IPL during the observation of\ntransitive actions (Buccino et al., 2001; Manthey et al., 2003), or\noverlap in the left IPL in a conjunction analysis of observed and\nexecuted transitive actions (Hetu et al., 2011). Peeters et al. (2009)\nscanned human volunteers, untrained monkeys, and two mon-\nkeys trained to use tools, while they observed hand actions and\nactions performed using simple tools. During tool use observa-\ntions, human participants exhibited speciﬁc activation of a rostral\nregion in left IPL (aSMG) that was not observed in the untrained\nand trained monkeys. The authors claim that this uniquely human\nregion underlies a speciﬁc way of understanding tool actions in\nterms of causal relationships between the intended use of the tool\nwww.frontiersin.org March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 11\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nand the results obtained by its use, and represents a fundamen-\ntal evolutionary leap enlarging the motor repertoire of humans\n(Peeters et al., 2009). Interestingly, the aSMG coordinate reported\nin this comparative fMRI study (−52,−26, 34, MNI coordinate) is\nvery similar to the mean iaSMG coordinate reported in the tool use\npantomime section andTa b l e 1(−56, −31, 34, MNI coordinate).\nObserved pantomimed use of objects and tools\nHalsband et al. (2001)showed patients with left or right parietal\nor premotor lesions video clips of familiar pantomimed gestures.\nThey were asked to recognize the gestures and subsequently imi-\ntate them from memory. The patients showed little problems with\ngesture comprehension, but the left parietal volunteers were most\nseverely disturbed on imitation performance, especially with ges-\ntures on their own body (combing one’s hair) rather than with\nan external object (hammering a nail). In a related study, healthy\nvolunteers observed similar sets of pantomimes while undergo-\ning fMRI (Lotze et al., 2006). aIPS was activated in body-referred\nand isolated hand pantomimes, whereas left inferior SMG and AG\nshowed a signiﬁcantly increased response to body-referred pan-\ntomimes compared to an isolated hand pantomiming an external\nobject.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nPARIETAL REGIONS IMPLICATED IN REACHING, GRASPING, AND TOOL\nUSE\nReaching involves the transportation of the limb effector toward\nthe target, a task that is usually performed under visual guid-\nance and thus requires the integration of visual and proprioceptive\ncoordinates in a network that is able to respond ﬂexibly to chang-\ning target positions and effector facilities. Human parietal areas\nassociated with this ability include pIPS and superior PPC areas.\npIPS regions appear to deal with the correspondence of visual\nand motor coordinates, whereas more rostral superior SPL/PCu\nareas seem to provide input regarding target related proprioceptive\ninformation. Both regions are believed to interact during reaches\nand share speciﬁcs of grasps.\nGrasping is regarded as the act that completes the transitive\nmovement, the merging of hand and object. As in reaching, it\nis likely to be guided visually and also requires close interplay\nwith proprioceptive information. As a result, there is a substan-\ntial overlap in parietal regions subserving reaching and grasping\ntasks, especially along the IPS. Grasp speciﬁc areas include the aIPS\nand probably also cIPS. The former is a well-established grasp-\ning region involved in the perception and execution of prehensile\nhand conﬁgurations and very similar in function to monkey\nAIP , although in humans its function also appears to encompass\ngoal-directed action planning. cIPS is believed to play a role in\nprehension-related texture analysis. As in reaching, more supe-\nrior and medial (SPL) areas are shown to respond when on-line\nadjustments of the grasping movement seem necessary.\nIn contrast to reaching and grasping that seem present at birth,\nthe functional useof objects and tools requires the recall of learned\nobject interactions. T ool manipulation knowledge can be demon-\nstrated in a variety of ways. In general, neuropsychological and\nneuroimaging studies agree on a strong left hemispheric lateral-\nization for praxis, although they don’t always agree on the key role\nof the PPC. Compared to reaching and grasping, the left hemi-\nspheric dominance of praxis, regardless of which hand performs\nthe task, underscores the more conceptual level of the mental oper-\nations involved. When contrasted to simple motor control tasks,\ntool use paradigms demonstrate widespread activation along the\nIPS and adjacent areas. But given its many possible task com-\nparisons tool use paradigms usually explore more ﬁne-grained\ntask differences concerning stimulus type, movement goal, effec-\ntor choice, assessment method, etc. Subtraction of similar tool use\nactivation patterns reﬂecting subtle task differences offer detail\non the functional role of particular cortical areas, but also ﬁl-\nter away most of the basic prehensile PPC activation, and may\nmake us unobservant of its key role in every goal-directed tran-\nsitive action. This being said, comparison of different tool use\ntasks reveals that actual tool use is accompanied by activation of\nthe sensorimotor cortex and this might help apraxic patients in\nthe recall of the appropriate tool use gestures. When this propri-\noceptive feedback is absent, as during tool use pantomiming or\ntool use imagery, individuals are more reliant on memorized tool\ninteractions, and this appears to elicit neural responses in the IPL.\nPossibly, multiple IPL foci exist, mediating different types of infor-\nmation of learned transitive movements and interactions. Similar\nto the reaching and grasping of objects, tool use also seems asso-\nciated with SPL activation, although it may not be the same SPL\nregions that contribute to each of the action components. The\ncore regions underlying reach and grasp gestures, however, are\norganized along the IPS, whereas the core regions subserving func-\ntional object use activate the phylogenetic new inferior parietal\ncortex.\nTHE PUTATIVE ROLE OF THE POSTERIOR PARIETAL REGION\nT raditionally, the parietal cortex is considered as a major com-\nponent of a dorsal visual pathway (occipital-parietal route) that\nencodes spatial location (“where” an object is) and can be differ-\nentiated from a ventral visual pathway (occipital-temporal route)\nresponsible for object identiﬁcation (“what” an object is;Unger-\nleider and Mishkin, 1982 ). Later, Goodale and Milner (1992)\nre-interpreted the functional role of the dorsal visual stream from\n“where” to “how, ” taking into account its prominent role in the\ncontrol of skilled motor action.\nBoth the reaching and grasping literature, and the research on\ntool use – which seem to have evolved as two relatively separate\nlines of research – have proposed further subdivisions of the dorsal\nstream. Based on animal research and clinical data a differentia-\ntion of the dorsal stream was proposed into a dorso-dorsal part\nimportant for the online control of the transitive action and a\nventro-dorsal stream involved with action organization (T anne-\nGariepy et al., 2002; Rizzolatti and Matelli, 2003). In the monkey\nbrain, a dorso-dorsal stream originates from an extrastriate visual\nnode V6, and connects with areas V6A and the medial intra-\nparietal area (MIP) in the medial bank of the IPS (SPL), which\nis closely linked to the somatosensory system. Its major func-\ntional role is described as important for the “on-line” control of\naction. A ventro-dorsal stream stems from another extrastriate\nnode MT (middle temporal), and connects to the IPL and medial\nsuperior temporal area (MST). In addition to action organiza-\ntion, the ventro-dorsal stream is hypothesized to play a role in\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 12\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\nobject awareness, control of hand posture, and action understand-\ning (Rizzolatti and Matelli, 2003). Based on neuropsychological\nevidence and functional imaging data, it is suggested that a com-\nparable segregation might exist in humans, one for acting on and\nanother for acting with objects,and that hand-object interactions\nfollow different streams dependent on the goal to be achieved\n(Johnson and Grafton, 2003;Johnson-Frey, 2004; Buxbaum et al.,\n2006, 2007; Daprati and Sirigu, 2006; Vingerhoets et al., 2009a). If\nan object is to be moved (acting on), visual information regarding\nthe object’s intrinsic (shape and size) and extrinsic (orientation\nand location) qualities will guide the movement’s reach trajectory\nand grasp aperture. Conceptual knowledge about the target is not\nrequired and the movement is guided by an IPS/SPL network. If\nwe wish to use the object (acting with), stored knowledge about its\nfunctional properties is required and is integrated with the percep-\ntual affordances of the “on-line” pathway. The conceptual input is\nbelieved to rely on IPL structures and guides a functional grasp\nand purposeful movement with the object.\nSimilarly, reach and grasp research proposed a distinction\nbetween dorsomedial (transport) and dorsolateral (grip) sub-\nstreams within the parieto-frontal cortex (Grol et al., 2007; Cavina-\nPratesi et al., 2010; V esia and Crawford, 2012). Dorsomedial pari-\netal regions include SPOC, whereas dorsolateral regions include\naIPS, although a signiﬁcant crosstalk between both substreams is\nexpected (Grol et al., 2007).\nBoth the tool use and the reach and grasp lines of research\nsuggest a division of the dorsal stream in two functionally differ-\nent substreams based on empirical ﬁndings within each research\ntradition. Although there are clear similarities between the propos-\nals, there are also differences, with the transport/grip distinction\nfocusing on SPL/IPS regions and their frontal projections and\nthe more transitive “use” literature concentrating on the sepa-\nrate contribution of perceptual versus semantic information in\naction control and the importance of IPL for the latter. A possible\nintegration of both views would be to consider a reach-and-grasp\nmovement as the backbone of every transitive gesture. Such an\nact requires the integration of visual and somatosensory informa-\ntion that in primates appears to be organized mainly along the\nIPS in a mosaic of areas that have graded input to the different\ncomponents (reach or grasp), modalities (visual, somatosensory),\nand effectors (hand, arm, eye) that contribute to the reach and\ngrasp movement. Its complexity reﬂects the primate’s ability of\nperforming complex transitive actions associated with indepen-\ndent bilateral control over hands with opposable thumbs and its\ncortical network occupies a bilateral IPS territory that bridges\nincoming visual and somatosensory input. At the same time,\nthe core IPS-centered reach-and-grasp process is supported (and\nif necessary corrected or adapted) by two different sources of\ninformation. The ﬁrst is predominantly sensory and perceptual\nin nature and subserves corrections due to more demanding\nvisuo-spatial/tactile-proprioceptive matches. It contributes to the\non-line control of the transitive action and is mainly performed in\ndorsomedial PPC, in particular SPL. The second source of infor-\nmation that contributes to the reach-and-grasp process is more\nsemantic in nature as it relies on functional knowledge about the\nobject, previous experience with the associated actions, and proba-\nbly also on acquired insight in mechanical relations. The IPL may\nnot necessarily be the repository of all of this knowledge, but it\nsomehow controls the way in which action semantics inﬂuences\nthe transitive gesture. This source of information and its inﬂuence\non the transport/grip action is clearly lateralized, usually to the\nleft. It is especially well-developed in humans and may constitute a\nmajor difference with non-human primate transitive movements.\nFor a proper understanding of the role of each of these processes, it\nis important to note that a reach and grasp action is not completed\nonce the target object is held. Subsequent object manipulation\nrequires continued adaptations of visuospatial coordinates (trans-\nport) and hand posture (grip) in order to carry out the desired\ntransitive movement. Depending on the type and phase of the\ntransitive action, differential input from both information sources\nis continuously necessary to steer transport and grip components\nadaptively in a given situation and environment.\nEFFECTOR-SPECIFIC, SIDE-SPECIFIC, AND ACTION-SPECIFIC PARIETAL\nMAPPING\nIn the paragraphs on reaching and grasping, we already pointed to\nthe lateralized effects of hemi-ﬁeld presentation (reaching to tar-\ngets in right or left hemi-space produces more robust contralateral\npIPS activation) and effector performance (reaching with the right\nor left effector evokes more robust contralateral activation in ante-\nrior IPS; Blangero et al., 2009). Many ﬁndings also have led to the\nview that PPC is organized in an effector-speciﬁc manner, with\ndifferent subregions mediating movements for hand, arm, and\neye respectively. What remains uncertain is the degree of effec-\ntor and computational speciﬁcity of these regions in particular in\nthe human PPC (V esia and Crawford, 2012) .I nar e v i e wo nr e a c h\nfunction these authors investigat ed effector speciﬁcity of reach\nversus saccades and reach versus grasp to come to the conclu-\nsion that there is empirical evidence for the existence of effector\nspeciﬁcity and for a substantial overlap. Increases in the spatial\nresolution of current neuroimaging techniques appears required\nto shed more light on the effector speciﬁcity of human reach and\ngrasp movements.\nIn tool use research lateralized effector-speciﬁcity seems to be\nof lesser importance. The side of the hand performing the tool\nmanipulation has little effect on the strong leftward parietal acti-\nvation, and even left handers show a clear left dominant praxis\nnetwork (Vingerhoets et al., 2012a). The type of effector used how-\never does seem to elicit some effector-speciﬁc mapping in PPC.\nBuccino et al. (2001)had volunteers observe transitive and intran-\nsitive gestures performed by hand, leg, and mouth and their results\ndemonstrated effector speciﬁcity in the PPC of both hemispheres.\nLater research also pointed to the existence of PPC regions that\nshowed overlapping activation during similar actions observed by\ndifferent effectors, suggesting a form of action mapping that is\nindependent of the effector performing the task ( Jastorff et al.,\n2010; Heed et al., 2011; Lorey et al., 2013). As this research mainly\nfocused on S-states (observation and imagery) and not on actual\neffector performance, and effector and action speciﬁcity appear\nto depend on the type of S-state applied (Lorey et al., 2013), fur-\nther research appears necessary. The discovery of action-speciﬁc\nmapping is an intriguing ﬁnding that begs the question along\nwhich dimensions transitive action-speciﬁcity is organized. Given\nits association with the functional meaning of transitive actions,\nwww.frontiersin.org March 2014| Volume 5 | Article 151 | 13\nVingerhoets Parietal contribution to transitive action\naction mapping regions may be expected to be found in an IPL\nlocation and this indeed seems to be the case (Jastorff et al., 2010;\nLorey et al., 2013).\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis study was supported by grant number G.0555.11 attributed\nto the author by the Fund for Scientiﬁc Research – Flanders\n(www.fwo.be).\nREFERENCES\nAndres, M., Pelgrims, B., and Olivier, E.
