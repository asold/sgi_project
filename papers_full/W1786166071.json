  "abstract": "A 60 GHz low‐noise amplifier (LNA) using standard 65 nm CMOS technology is presented. A gain of the 60 GHz amplifier was boosted by using a transformer feedbacked capacitor neutraliser. To stabilise the process variations caused by the positive feedback system, the body node of the triple well was adjusted to tune the capacitor value. The theory, simulation and measurements are presented. An implementation prototype is evaluated using on‐wafer proving. The LNA showed a measured peak gain of 30 dB and a measured noise of 4.6 dB under 8.9 mW power consumption with a 1 V supply voltage. The measured IIP3 was −26 dBm. This is believed to be the first CMOS 60 GHz LNA to compensate the overlap capacitor with a single‐ended structure.",
