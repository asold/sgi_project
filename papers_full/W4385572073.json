In this paper, we\ndesign a unified parameter-efficient multitask\nlearning framework that works effectively on\nboth NLP and V&L tasks.

Our proposed\nframework adds fewer trainable parameters in\nmulti-task learning while achieving superior\nperformances and transfer ability compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Empirical results on\nthe GLUE benchmark and multiple V&L tasks\nconfirm the effectiveness of our framework.\n1 Introduction\nPretraining and fine-tuning are now the prevalent\nparadigm in natural language processing, yield-\ning state-of-the-art performances on a variety of\ntasks (Devlin et al., 2019). With pre-trained lan-\nguage models (PLMs) growing rapidly in size, it\nbecomes increasingly infeasible to perform con-\nventional fine-tuning on the entire model parame-\nters. There has recently been one line of research\non Parameter-Efficient Language model Tuning\n(PELT)(Houlsby et al., 2019; Li and Liang, 2021;\nHe et al., 2021; Mao et al., 2022). They only up-\ndate a set of extra trainable task-specific parameters\nthat are newly introduced to PLMs. Although the\nnumber of new parameters is much fewer than the\n*Work is done at the internship of Noah’s Ark Lab, Huawei\nTechnologies.\n†Equal Contribution.\n‡Corresponding authors.\noriginal PLM, training these parameters per sin-\ngle task is still costly, especially when targeting a\nnumber of tasks, i.e., multi-tasking scenario.\nTherefore, we are motivated to start with a uni-\nfied parameter-efficient language model tuning\nframework (He et al., 2021) and explore on a shared\nhypernetwork (von Oswald et al., 2020; Mahabadi\net al., 2021) that is able to take multi-task informa-\ntion as input, and generate weights for tuning differ-\nent task-specific modules of PLMs, such as the pa-\nrameters inserted into multi-head attention blocks\n(i.e., prefix-tuning) and feed-forward blocks (i.e.,\nadapter-tuning.). We name it HyperPELT. Be-\nsides, we propose a novel perspective of adopting\nparameter-efficient multimodal fusion for PLMs\nvia the hypernetwork. Thus we explore to use an\nadditional separate hypernetwork handling visual\ninput and generating visual-specific weights for\nmultiple modules of PLMs.\nEmpirical results on 8 tasks of GLUE bench-\nmark show that HyperPELT achieves superior per-\nformances (87.09 vs. 86.53) with a tenth of the\nparameters (0.24% vs. 2.96%) when compared to\nstate-of-the-art alternatives. Study on the few-shot\ntransfer learning indicates that HyperPELT is more\nstable and efficient than alternatives. It confirms\nthe effectiveness of our unified parameter-efficient\nmultitask learning framework. What’s more, we\nevaluate our framework on V&L multi-tasks (4\ntasks). Results show the promising performance of\nour novel fusion method on extending V&L ability\non top of PLMs via hypernetworks.\nIn summary, we make the following contribu-\ntions: (1) propose a unified parameter-efficient\nmultitask learning framework that is able to take\nmulti-task and multi-modality information as in-\nput, and generate weights for tuning different task-\nspecific modules of PLMs; (2) present a novel\nperspective of using hypernetworks to achieve the\nparameter-efficient multimodal fusion on top of\nPLMs; (3) design various experiments to compre-\n11442\nFor visual embedding\nNonlinear\nLayer norm\nWup bup\nWdown bdown\nIv\nBlock\nEmbedding\nTask\nEmbedding\nMLP\nPrefix\nKQ VPK PV\nMulti-head Attention\nLayer norm\nLayer norm\nAdapter\nN×\nEncoder Hyper-Embedding Computing\nAdapter\nPk\nPv\nIτ\nFFN\nUpdated layer Frozen layer\nLayer\nEmbeddingNonlinear\nLayer norm\nWup bupAdapter\nλ×\nIτ\nPK\nPV\nWdown bdown\nℎ𝑃𝑃\n𝑣𝑣\nℎ𝑃𝑃\n𝜏𝜏\nℎ𝐴𝐴\n𝑣𝑣\nℎ𝐴𝐴\n𝜏𝜏\nFor task embedding\nBlock\nEmbedding\nVisual\nEmbedding\nMLPIv\nLayer\nEmbedding\nImage\nCLIP\nMapping \nLayer\nFigure 1: The model structure of the proposed unified pure language and V&L multi-task framework (left), and\nillustration of computing the hyper-embedding (right). We use green color to fill the trainable layers and grey color\nfor the frozen ones. And the dashed parts denote the modules for processing visual modality.\nhensively demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro-\nposed framework in multi-task learning and few-\nshot domain transfer scenarios.\n2 Related Work\nExisting research has explored a large amount of\nmethods on parameter-efficient tuning, such as the\nwidely used adapter-tuning (Houlsby et al., 2019),\nprefix-tuning (Li and Liang, 2021) and the mixed\nmethods (He et al., 2021; Mao et al., 2022). How-\never, it is time & space-consuming to deal with\na set of tasks in multi-task learning if we simply\nupdate and save separate replicas of model param-\neters per single task. In this work, we explore a\nhypernetwork-based multi-task learning framework\nto generate weights for different PELT modules.\nBesides, there has been a series of recent\nwork (Cho et al., 2021; Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021;\nSung et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022) to equip a\nlanguage model with the ability of handling visual\ninput with a small number of trainable modules and\nparameters. Different from existing work, we pro-\npose a novel perspective of multimodal fusion via\nextending the proposed parameter-efficient multi-\ntask learning framework. We further review recent\nresearch on parameter-efficient tuning for pure lan-\nguage and V&L tasks, as well as the corresponding\nwork for multi-task learning in Appendix A.\n3 Proposed Method\nWe target a general multi-task learning problem,\nwhich is formulated in Appendix B. In this section,\nwe describe the hyper-embedding I for hypernet-\nworks to generate weights ∆θand which modules\nof PLMs to insert these weights to achieve PELT.\nIn our methods, the hyper-embedding I consists of\ntwo: task-specific hyper-embedding Iτ, and visual-\nspecific hyper-embedding Iv. We will mostly intro-\nduce the hyper-embedding Iτ, and Iv is used in a\nsimilar parallel manner. A simple linear projection\nlayer is employed as the hypernetwork, for exam-\nple, hτ\nP(.) and hv\nP(.) are used for prefix-tuning,\nwhile hτ\nA(.) and hv\nA(.) are for adapter-tuning as\nshown in Figure 1. The hypernetwork takes the\nhyper-embedding I as input, and outputs weights\nfor multiple modules of PLMs.\n3.1 Hyper-Embedding for PELT\nConsidering a flexible parameterization of task-\nspecific parameters for Llayers of transformer, we\nintroduce a set of layer id embeddingsI= {li}L\ni=1,\nand block type embeddings B= {bj}5\nj=1, which\nspecify the position where the parameters ∆θare\ninserted to. Then, we compute a hyper-embedding\nIτ ∈RdI for each individual task via a task projec-\ntor network, which is a multi-layer perceptron con-\nsisting of two feed-forward layers and a ReLU non-\nlinearity: Iτ = MLP([zτ,li,bj]). Thus, it learns a\nsuitable compressed hyper-embedding from a con-\ncatenation of task embeddings zτ ∈Rdτ, layer id\n11443\nembeddings li ∈Rdτ, and block type embeddings\nbj ∈Rdτ. In this way, the hypernetwork is able to\nproduce distinct weights for tuning each task, and\neach transformer block at each layer.\n3.2 HyperPELT: Incorporate with\nPrefix-tuning and Adapter-tuning\nTo further capture knowledge across tasks and\ntransfer to others, we follow the unified parameter-\nefficient framework (He et al., 2021), and input the\nhyper-embedding to a hypernetwork for generating\nthe weights in adapters as well as prefix vectors.\nWe extend the dimension for different embeddings\nto match the prefix length N, i.e., z ∈ RN×dτ,\nli ∈RN×dτ, bj ∈RN×dτ, and then compute the\nhyper-embedding Iτ ∈RN×dI. We finally employ\na hypernetwork hτ\nP(.) with trainable parameters\nθhτ\nP, to project Iτ to prefix vectors Pτ ∈RN×d:\nPτ = hτ\nP(θhτ\nP,Iτ) .\nBesides, as depicted in Figure 1, we introduce\na hypernetwork-based adapter layer with a train-\nable scaled parameter λ, which is inserted par-\nallelly with feed-forward blocks. We generate\nadapter weights (Wτ\nup,Wτ\ndown) through a hypernet-\nwork hτ\nA(.): (Wτ\nup,Wτ\ndown) := hτ\nA(θhτ\nA,Iτ), where\nWτ\ndown ∈Rdmid×d and Wτ\nup ∈Rd×dmid .\n3.3 VL-HyperPELT: Incorporate with Visual\nModality\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, we use CLIP (Radford\net al., 2021) with a trainable visual mapping layer,\nwhich projects the visual representation to the\nidentical dimension of task embedding, i.e., zv ∈\nRN×dv,dv = dτ. Then we feed this visual rep-\nresentation zv to a visual projector network. In\nthis way, we learn the visual hyper-embedding\nIv ∈RdI. Finally, taking the visual-specific hyper-\nembeddings as input, we use visual-specific hyper-\nnetworks to generate visual-specific parameters to\ndifferent modules in PLMs. Similar to the Sec-\ntion 3.1 & 3.2, the incorporation of visual-specific\nparameters to PLMs are the same as task-specific\nones, e.g., used as prefix vectors via a prefix hyper-\nnetwork hv\nP(.) and adapter weights via an adapter\nhypernetwork hv\nA(.). We name it VL-HyperPELT.\n4 Results and Analysis\nWe conduct a series of experiments to verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed framework compared\nto existing ones.\n4.1 Implementation Details\nOur models are built on T5BASE (Raffel et al.,\n2020) 1, which contains 12 layers and 222M pa-\nrameters, and use the tokenizer of T5 to tokenize\ntext inputs. We set N = 49 , d = dτ = 768 ,\ndI = 64 for all the experiments. Following the\ntraining strategies from Raffel et al. (2020), we\nfine-tune all models with a constant learning rate of\n0.001, use 218 = 262144 steps in all experiments\nwith batch size of 128 and sample tasks via the\nconventional temperature-based sampler with tem-\nperature T = 2 , i.e., sample corresponding task\nproportional to p1/T\nτ , where pτ = Nτ∑T\ni=1 Nτ\nand\nNτ is the number of training samples for the τ-th\ntask. We did not experiment with other complex\nsampling strategies or tuning of T. For the experi-\nments under multi-task training settings, we save\na checkpoint every 1000 steps and report results\non a single checkpoint with the highest average\nvalidation performance across all tasks.\nIn terms of the vision-and-language scenarios,\nwe convert V&L tasks to the text generation for-\nmat as Cho et al. (2021). We use ResNet101 as\nour vision encoder, and initialize it with weights\nfrom pretrained CLIP (Radford et al., 2021). Input\nimages are resized to 224 ×224 for memory effi-\nciency. We extract the 7×7 grid features produced\nby the last convolutional layer. The percentage of\nupdated parameters is also reported as one metric\nfor approach efficiency, and we do not take visual\nencoder into account since it is frozen in our exper-\niment.\n4.2 Datasets\nOur framework is evaluated on the GLUE bench-\nmark (Wang et al., 2019b) in terms of natural\nlanguage understanding. This benchmark cov-\ners multiple tasks of paraphrase detection (MRPC,\nQQP), sentiment classification (SST-2), natural lan-\nguage inference (MNLI, RTE, QNLI), and linguis-\ntic acceptability (CoLA). The original test sets are\nnot publicly available, and following Zhang et al.\n(2021), for datasets fewer than 10K samples (RTE,\nMRPC, STS-B, CoLA), we split the original valida-\ntion set into two halves, one for validation and the\nother for testing. For other datasets, we randomly\nsplit 1K samples from the training set for validation\nand test on the original validation set.\nIn addition, we evaluate the few-shot transfer\nperformance on four tasks and datasets: 1) the\n1https://huggingface.co/t5-base\n11444\nMethods #Total\nparams\n#Trained\nparams/taskCoLA SST-2 MRPC QQP STS-B MNLI QNLI RTE Avg\nSingle-Task Training\nT5BASE† 8.0× 100% 54.85 92.19 88.18/91.6191.46/88.6189.55/89.4186.4991.60 67.3984.67\nAdapters† 1+8×0.01 0.87% 59.4993.4688.18/91.55 90.94/88.01 87.44/87.18 86.38 92.2668.8484.88\nMulti-Task Training\nT5BASE† 1.0× 12.5% 54.88 92.54 90.15/93.01 91.13/88.07 88.84/88.53 85.66 92.04 75.3685.47\nAdapters† 1.07× 0.82% 61.5393.00 90.15/92.91 90.47/87.26 89.86/89.4486.0993.1770.2985.83\nPrefix-tuning♣ 1.14× 1.72% 56.67 93.9289.42/92.57 90.59/87.37 89.49/89.34 85.23 93.1779.1786.09\nMAMAdapters♣ 1.15× 2.96% 56.53 93.58 91.35/93.9690.58/87.5388.89/88.76 85.98 92.77 81.9486.53\nHYPERFORMER++† 1.02× 0.29% 63.73 94.0389.66/92.63 90.28/87.20 90.00/89.66 85.7493.0275.3686.48\nHyperPELT 1.02× 0.24% 65.9693.23 89.42/92.31 90.48/87.5489.15/89.07 85.35 92.79 82.6487.09\nTable 1: Performance of all models on the GLUE tasks.

For CB and BoolQ, since the test set\nis not available, we split the validation set into two\nhalves, one for validation and the other for testing.\nFor IMDB, since the validation set is not available,\nwe similarly split the test set to form validation.\nFor PAWS, we report on the original test set.\nTo evaluate our framework on V&L tasks, we ex-\nperiment on four datasets COCO (Lin et al., 2014),\nVQA (Goyal et al., 2017), VG-QA (Krishna et al.,\n2017) and GQA (Hudson and Manning, 2019). Fol-\nlowing Cho et al. (2021), we use VQA Karpathy\nsplit, which splits the VQA dataset into 605,102\n/ 26,729 / 26,280 image and question pairs sep-\narately as the train/validation/test set to evaluate\nVQA tasks in a generative manner. We further\nevaluate our framework on two datasets for V&L\nfew-shot transfer learning: OKVQA (Marino et al.,\n2019); SNLI-VE (Xie et al., 2018).\n4.3 Results on the GLUE Benchmark\nWe conduct experiments on GLUE for both single-\nand multi-task settings, as shown in Table 1. Com-\npared to the single-task Adapters that finetunes\nall newly introduced parameters in adapters, our\nmethod yields a significant improvement by 2.21%\nwith much fewer trainable parameters. It illustrates\nthe effectiveness of our proposed multi-task train-\ning framework. The comparison to MAMAdapter\nshows that using hypernetwork to tune each trans-\nformer module and thus learn the shared knowledge\nacross multitasks, leads to an improvement in task\nperformance (86.53 vs. 87.09) while training fewer\nparameters (2.96% vs. 0.24%). Overall, our Hy-\nperPELT obtains the best performance with less\ntrainable parameters.\n4.4 Few-shot Domain Transfer\nWe use the above models trained on GLUE as re-\nported in Table 1, and evaluate them on the test set\nof four different tasks, i.e., PAWS, IMDB, BoolQ,\nand CB, after being few-shot finetuned on each\ntarget training data, as shown in Figure 2.

(2021), ♠: Our re-implementation of Sung et al. (2021).\ntasks of CB and BoolQ from SuperGLUE, even\nthough the backbone T5 was previously trained on\nthe train sets of these two, the performance of all\nmethods differs a lot. The two baselines still do not\nwork with very few samples, like 4 and 16 samples.\nTherefore, we assume that the two baselines suf-\nfer from catastrophic forgetting problems to some\ndegree during multi-task training. In contrast, our\nproposed HyperPELT works effectively on these\ntwo tasks. We speculate that the reason might be\nthe use of hypernetworks on both prefix-tuning and\nadapter-tuning modules of transformer. We leave\nthis exploration to our future work.\nBesides, we show the results of Prompt-\ntuning (Lester et al., 2021) and fine-tuning only\nthe task embedding in our HyperPELT. Note\nthat in this comparison, we keep the same train-\nable parameters between these two methods, i.e.,\nRN×dτ, where N denotes the prompt length in\nPrompt-tuning method. Our HyperPELT TaskEm-\nbed mostly achieves a comparable or even better\nperformance than Prompt-tuning.\n4.5 Results on Vision-and-Language\nBenchmarks\nWe compare the pre-trained and full fine-tuning\nVL-T5 (Cho et al., 2021), and other adapter-based\nmethods built on top of T5, i.e., CLIP-T5and VL-\nAdapter (Sung et al., 2021) in the multi-task train-\ning setting. The results and the number of trainable\nparameters are reported in Table 2. Since the used\ndataset is slightly different from Sung et al. (2021)\nand their checkpoint is not avaliable at this time,\nwe re-implement CLIP-T5 and VL-Adpater. Com-\npared to which, our method achieves a comparable\nperformance with a fewer number of trainable pa-\nrameters (e.g., 7.16% of VL-Adapter vs. 6.62% of\nVL-HyperPELT).\nWe further evaluate our models on multimodal\nfew shot learning tasks and show its superiority\nin appendix E.1. To our best knowledge, we are\nthe first to employ the visual modality to tune the\nvery few parameters of different transformer blocks,\ninstead of normally inserting image patch tokens\nto the input sequence. Experimental results evi-\ndence the effectiveness of our novel approach, thus\nproviding a new perspective on how to extend the\nmulti-modality capability on top of PLMs.\n5 Discussion and Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a unified parameter-\nefficient tuning framework for multitasks. On the\none hand, we use the hypernetwork to reduce the\nscale of trainable parameters of existing adapter-\ntuning and prefix-tuning modules. On the other\nhand, for the V&L tasks, we directly integrate the\nimage features into the prefix vectors as well as\nadapters, which further reduces the number of train-\nable parameters for processing visual input. Exten-\nsive experiments on pure language and V&L tasks\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed frame-\nwork in both multi-tasking and few-shot settings.\nIn the future, we plan to explore more combination\nof methods across tuning task-specific and visual-\nspecific parameters for different modules of PLMs.\nLimitations\nOur experiments are conducted based on the T5-\nbase pre-trained language model. Due to the com-\nputational resource constraints, we did not conduct\nexperiments on other similar PLMs, such as BART,\nand T5 model with larger scale, such as T5-large\n11446\nand T5-3B. Although we believe our conclusion\ncan generalize to other backbones since T5 is a\nclassical encoder-decoder model, we will conduct\nmore experiments to confirm for future work.\nReferences\nRoee Aharoni, Melvin Johnson, and Orhan Firat. 2019.\nMassively multilingual neural machine translation.\nIn Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North\nAmerican Chapter of the Association for Computa-\ntional Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,\nNAACL-HLT 2019, Minneapolis, MN, USA, June 2-7,\n2019, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 3874–\n3884.

Ex-\nisting research (Liu et al., 2021a; Ding et al.,\n2022) has explored a large amount of methods on\nparameter-efficient tuning. These methods gener-\nally include two categories according to whether\nnew trainable parameters are introduced. One cate-\ngory is that only a subset of model parameters can\nbe updated while freezing the remain (Liu et al.,\n2021b; Lee et al., 2019). The other is introduc-\ning a few task-specific new parameters to different\nparts of pretrained models, such as multi-head at-\ntention (Li and Liang, 2021) and feedforward lay-\ners (Houlsby et al., 2019). In this method, a small\nnetwork (often named as hypernetwork with the\ninput embedding named as hyper-embedding) is\noften used to generate weights for a main network.\nOn the other hand, learning a unified model to\nperform well on multiple tasks ( i.e., multi-task\nlearning) is a challenging problem. It has to ad-\ndress many challenges such as catastrophic forget-\nting, and model overfitting in low-resource tasks\nwhile underfitting in high-resource tasks (Aharoni\net al., 2019). Radford et al. (2019) highlights the\nability of language models to perform a wide range\nof multitasks in a zero-shot setting. Mahabadi et al.\n(2021) proposes to use a shared hypernetwork (von\nOswald et al., 2020) to generate weights for a small\nnumber of parameters in adapter modules, thus to\nallow the model to adapt to each individual task in\na parameter-efficient manner.\nA range of recent work aims to unify parameter-\nefficient tuning methods (He et al., 2021; Mao et al.,\n2022), to achieve better tuning performance. We ex-\nplore a framework to generate weights for different\nPELT methods using the hypernetwork. Compared\nto only generating weights for adapters, empirical\nresults indicate that generating weights for multiple\nmodules of PLMs achieves superior performance\nwith fewer trainable parameters.\nA.2 Parameter-Efficient Tuning towards\nVision-and-Language\nBuilding vision-and-language models on top of\nPLMs pretrained on pure large text corpora has led\nto a noticeable improvement to V&L tasks (Cho\net al., 2021). There is a series of recent work that\nextends the ability of language models to handle\nmultimodal input in a parameter-efficient manner.\nFor example, Frozen (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021)\naligns the image representation to the text repre-\nsentation space of frozen GPT model which thus is\nable to generate captions for images. VL-Adapter\n(Sung et al., 2021) introduces a limited set of new\ntrainable parameters to T5 via the adapter-tuning\napproach that can match the performance of fine-\ntuning the entire model. Flamingo (Alayrac et al.,\n2022) uses an extra cross-attention module, whose\nkeys and values are generated via visual features,\nthus enabling language modeling conditioned on\nvisual inputs. Different from existing work, we\npropose a novel perspective of parameter-efficient\nmultimodal fusion. We introduce a seperate visual-\nspecific hypernetwork for handling visual input and\ngenerating weights for PLMs.\nB Mutli-task Learning Problem\nFormulation\nOur paper targets at a general multi-task learning\nproblem, where we are given the data from a set\nof tasks {Dτ}T\nτ=1. T is the total number of tasks\nand Dτ = {(xi\nτ,yi\nτ)}Nτ\ni=1 is the training data of\nthe τ-th task with Nτ samples. We are also given\na large-scale pretrained language model, i.e., T5,\nparameterized by θ, which generates the output yi\nτ\nfor input xi\nτ. The standard multi-task finetuning\nminimizes the following loss on the training set:\nLtotal =\nT∑\nτ=1\n∑\n(xiτ,yiτ)∈Dτ\nLtask(θ,xi\nτ,yi\nτ), (1)\n11449\nTask Input Text Target Text\nGLUE Tasks\nCoLA cola sentence: [sentence] acceptable/unacceptable\nSST-2 sst2 sentence: [sentence] positive/negative\nMRPC mrpc sentence1: [sentence1] sentence2: [sentence2] equivalent/not_equivalent\nQQP qqp question1: [question1] question2: [question2] duplicate/not_duplicate\nSTS-B stsb sentence1: [sentence1] sentence2: [sentence2] 0.0 - 5.0\nMNLI mnli hypothesis: [hypothesis] premise: [premise] entailment/neutral/contradiction\nQNLI qnli question: [question] sentence: [sentence] entailment/not_entailment\nRTE rte sentence1: [sentence1] sentence2: [sentence2] entailment/not_entailment\nFew-shot Tasks\nCB cb hypothesis: [hypothesis] premise: [premise] entailment/neutral/contradiction\nBoolQ boolq question: [question] context: [context] True/False\nIMDB imdb sentence: [sentence] positive/negative\nPAWS paws sentence1: [sentence1] sentence2: [sentence2] equivalent/not_equivalent\nVision-and-Language Tasks\nCOCO caption: [caption]\nVQA vqa question: [question] [answer]\nGQA gqa question: [question] [answer]\nVision-and-Language Few-shot Tasks\nOKVQA okvqa question: [question] [answer]\nSNLI-VE snli-ve premise: [premise] entailment/neutral/contradiction\nTable 4: Input-output formats for NLU and Vision-and-Language tasks. Following Raffel et al. (2020); Cho et al.\n(2021), we use different prefixes (such as “cola sentence:”, “vqa question:”) for questions from different datasets.\nwhere Ltask is the loss function of the tasks that is\nusually defined as the cross-entropy loss. Our goal\nis to efficiently finetune the given model in this\nmulti-task learning setting, allowing knowledge\nsharing across tasks, and at the same time, enabling\nthe model to adapt to each individual task.\nWe aim to integrate a unified hypernetwork-\nbased parameter-efficient transfer learning method\ninto a multi-task transformer model. In other word,\nwe insert the parameters generated by the hyper-\nnetworks ∆θ into the layer and attention blocks\nof PLMs. During training, we only update the hy-\npernetwork parameters θh with hyper-embedding\n{Iτ}T\nτ=1 and parameters in layer normalization,\nwhile the remaining model parameters inθare fixed\nas in the Equation 2.\nLtotal =\nT∑\nτ=1\n∑\n(xiτ,yiτ)∈Dτ\nLtask(∆θ,θ,x i\nτ,yi\nτ)\n=\nT∑\nτ=1\n∑\n(xiτ,yiτ)∈Dτ\nLtask(Iτ,θh,θ,x i\nτ,yi\nτ)\n,\n(2)\nC Number of Tunable Parameters\nFollowing He et al. (2021), to simplify the com-\nputation of tunable parameters, we compute the\nsum of parameter used in one encoder layer and\none decoder layer as the parameter overhead of\none single layer of the pre-trained encoder-decoder\nmodel. T5 has an encoder-decoder structure that\nhas L layers. Each layer has Battn blocks and\nBffn blocks. For the encoder-decoder models like\nT5, Battn = 3 : the encoder self-attention block,\nthe decoder self-attention block and the decoder\ncross-attention block and Bffn = 2: encoder feed-\nforward block and decoder feed-forward block.\nFor modifications applied at the attention blocks,\nthe number of tunable parameters is computed\nby θattn = θattn\nW ×Battn ×L, where θattn\nW denotes\nthe number of parameters used for one attention\nsub-layer. Similarly, the number of tunable pa-\nrameters for the FFN sub-layers is computed by\nθffn = θffn\nW ×Bffn ×L. Finally, the total number\nof tunable parameters for prefix tuning and adapter\nvariants is θ = θattn + θffn as applicable. Using\nT5 as an example, we present the number of pa-\nrameters used by several representative methods\nthroughout our paper in Tab. 3.\nD Experimental Setup\nD.1 Input-Output Formats\nAs shown in Tab. 4, we formulate the input text\nand labels from each task to the corresponding\n11450\nFigure 3: Few-shot domain transfer results of two differ-\nent V&L tasks averaged across 5 seeds. We report the\nvqa-score on OKVQA validation split, and the accuracy\non SNLI-VE test-P split.\ntarget text, and we learn these different tasks by\npredicting target text with the language modeling\nobjective in Eq. 2.\nE Additional Results and Analysis\nE.1 Multimodal Few-shot Learning\nWe further use the models trained on V&L tasks as\nreported in Figure 3 and evaluate them on the test\nset after few-shot fine-tuning on OKVQA (Marino\net al., 2019) and SNLI-VE (Xie et al., 2018). For\nOKVQA, since there is no test set, we split its origi-\nnal validation set into two halves, one for validating\nand the other for testing. For SNLI-VE, we use its\nvalidation set for validating, and test-P set for test-\ning and reporting results. We follow the methods\nin Section 4.4 to select samples, and report results\nin Figure 3.\nCompared with the full parameter fine-tuning,\ni.e., CLIP-T5, and the previous parameter-efficient\nV&L method VL-Adapter, our method achieves\nthe best performance. It is also worth noting that\nfor the used five random seeds, the variance of\nour method is generally smaller than VL-Adapter,\nwhich indicates that our method is more robust in\nthis few-shot learning scenario. We believe that our\nframework, though training less parameters, can\nstill capture knowledge across tasks and transfer\nthem in the multimodal few-shot setting.\n11451\nACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist\nA For every submission:\n□\u0013 A1.
