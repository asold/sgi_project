Despite the significant contribution of family\ncaregivers to the economy in many developed countries, there is considerable evidence in the\nnational and international literature, of the physical, psychological and social morbidity associ-\nated with caregiving, highlighted in studies with adverse titles, such as:“Caring enough to be\npoor” [1]; “Ignored and invisible” [2]; “Caregiving as a risk factor for mortality” [3]; “Missed\nOpportunities” [4]; “Warning— caring is a health hazard” [5]; “Family caregivers and leisure:\nan oxymoron?” [6]; “The hardest thing we have ever done: The social impact of caring for a\ndying person in Australia” [7]. Caregivers tend to be overlooked and often referred to as“hid-\nden patients” [8].\nStudies have shown that caregivers with better experiences of end-of-life care were substan-\ntially less depressed over time and had better bereavement outcomes [9,10]. While a wide re-\nsearch literature base exists on caregiver interventions [11–13], more needs to be achieved\nregarding demonstrating and validating robust and effective caregiver support interventions\nand establishing ways of disseminating and sharing evidence of successful interventions that\naddress caregiver experiences and needs [14], and ameliorate the effects of caregiving [15,16].\nAs family caregivers experience numerous support needs, the challenge is to find accessible\nand acceptable approaches for caregivers in order to meet their needs or interventions that ad-\ndress the range of needs [17]. While‘one to one’interventions for caregivers have been re-\nported to be useful though expensive, group interventions can be hard for many caregivers to\nundertake because of the need to be away from the care recipient [18,19].\nFamily caregivers need to be supported in their central role of caring and their support\nneeds well identified by the service providers. However, brief practical tools to assess their sup-\nport needs have been lacking or consisted of indirect measures of caregiving difficulties, feel-\nings of burden, meaning and relationship issues [20]. The Carer Support Needs Assessment\nTool (CSNAT) is a validated evidence based tool developed for home based care to fill the gap\nbetween validated research tools that have minor relevance to actual practice and more ad hoc\nservice-based assessment forms that lack an adequate evidence base [21\n,22].\nThe CSNAT adopts a screening format, structured around 14 broad support domains. This\nformat allows it to be brief but also comprehensive, enabling caregivers to identify the domains\nin which they require further support which can then be discussed with health professionals.\nEach item represents a core family caregiver support domain in end of life home care and these\ndomains fall into two distinct groupings: those that enable the caregiver to care and those that\nenable more direct support for themselves.\nAims\nAims of the study were to investigate the impact of using the carer support needs assessment\ntool (CSNAT), as an intervention to identify and address support needs in end of life home\ncare, on family caregiver outcomes such as strain, distress and mental and physical health; and\nto describe the implementation strategies, identified support needs and provided solutions to\naddress the needs of family caregivers.\nMethod\nThe study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HR 24/\n2011) and the Silver Chain Human Research Ethics Committee (EC App 068). All participants\nprovided written informed consent to participate in this study and the two ethics committees ap-\nproved this consent procedure. All aspects of the trial conformed to CONSORT requirements.\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 2/1 6\nFunding: This research was financially supported by\nan Australian Research Council linkage grant and\nSilver Chain (LP110100622).\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nSetting\nThe trial was conducted in Perth, Western Australia, in three sites of the Silver Chain Hospice\nCare Service (SCHCS) in 2012–14. Silver Chain is Australia’s largest provider of home based\npalliative care. The service is provided by an interdisciplinary team comprising general practi-\ntioners with a special interest in palliative care, medical consultants, registrars, resident medical\nofficers, palliative care specialist nurses, counsellors, chaplains, care assistants, social workers\nand volunteers, who work with the patient to control symptoms and address psychosocial\nneeds. Typically, nurses visit patients weekly and increase visits according to client needs for\ncare and symptom management and care assistants provide personal care visits three times per\nweek to daily depending on patient needs. The average length of stay with the service is approx-\nimately 90 days.\nTrial design\nThe study was a stepped-wedge cluster non-randomised trial. Each of the three bases under-\ntook the intervention in a stepped sequence wherein the CSNAT was introduced at each site at\ndifferent time points, with the pre-intervention period serving as a control period (Fig 1). Inter-\nvention start times for each base were assigned by the researcher. The sequence was not rando-\nmised because the service preferred to start with the site that undertook the pilot study\n(described below), being more ready to implement the intervention. This also gave more time\nfor the other two sites to settle into this research study, in terms of adapting to all aspects of the\nresearch process, before they were ready to implement the intervention.\nA stepped-wedge design was considered more appropriate, cost effective and practical than\na cluster randomised controlled trial. As all sites start as controls, any baseline differences be-\ntween sites can be ascertained. Also, a randomized controlled trial within each base was consid-\nered not feasible because contamination could occur as staff can be visiting clients in both\ngroups within each base [23,24].\nParticipants\nParticipants were primary family caregivers of terminally ill patients (with cancer or non-cancer\ndiagnoses) referred to Silver Chain Hospice Care. A primary family caregiver was defined as a\nFig 1. Stepped Wedge Trial Design.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012.g001\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 3/1 6\nperson who, without payment, provided physical care (and emotional care) to a person who was\nexpected to die during provision of the caring role. This care could be provided on a daily or in-\ntermittent basis. All adult caregivers (aged 18 years or older) who were able to read and write in\nEnglish were eligible for the study, unless the service had concerns about their ability to cope\nwith research because of the exceptionally high levels of distress. Family caregivers with a\nknown cognitive impairment were excluded based on the nurses’clinical judgment.\nIntervention and Training\nThe CSNAT intervention consisted of at least two visits from nurses to caregivers, 2 to 3 weeks\napart, where nurses incorporated the CSNAT into a practitioner facilitated but caregiver-led\napproach to needs assessment and support. Family caregivers identified domains where they\nneeded more support. This was accomplished by the CSNAT being either self-completed by\nthe family caregiver or completed jointly with the nurse. Then a conversation took place to de-\ntermine individual needs and the caregiver’s priorities were discussed with the nurse to agree\non actions/solutions and a shared action plan.\nTherefore nurses were trained in the use of the CSNAT as a caregiver-led approach for identi-\nfying and addressing caregiver needs rather than the traditional way of professional-led approach.\nOne training session of 2–3 hours long was provided (mostly in groups of 6–8) at the start of data\ncollection for the intervention. Therefore, a total of six main training sessions (2 sessions for each\nsite) were undertaken to accommodate the availability of staff. Due to the additional time pressure\ntraining sessions were perceived to add to the nurses’busy schedules, we were asked to keep ses-\nsions short and not so frequent. These initial training sessions were followed towards the middle\nof the data collection period by three refresher sessions (1 session for each site) lasting 1–2h o u r s\nto discuss nurses’experiences, issues with recruiting and completing the intervention. In addition,\nthe research team had monthly meetings with the designated champion of the project in the ser-\nvice (a senior clinical nurse manager) to follow progress and discuss challenges in each site. Sug-\ngestions from the research team were relayed back by the champion to the recruiting nurses\nduring their regular weekly clinical meetings. Furthermore, nurses had daily access by phone to\nthe advice of the research nurse, and texting was the preferred way for individual nurses to liaise\nwith the research nurse.\nAll three sites commenced as control sites for the first time period (Fig 1). As each site en-\ntered the intervention phase, the training for each intervention site was timed to be provided\nimmediately prior to the intervention commencing at the particular site. In general, each site\nhad its own staff, but sometimes a few were called upon to assist in another site for a short peri-\nod if there were staff shortages due to sickness or other operational matters. However, to avoid\ncontamination across sites, efforts were made to ensure the nurses with intervention training\nwere not available to work with control group participants at another site.\nThe control group received‘standard practice’which consisted of the staff meeting with the\ncaregiver during the client visit and discussing caregiver needs on an informal basis. Following\nthis discussion, the staff member would offer services and equipment that Silver Chain was\nable to provide. However many conversations were on an ad hoc basis and not documented.\nRecruitment and data collection\nAt the start of the study, family caregivers of clients newly admitted or already receiving pallia-\ntive care were invited by participating nurses to take part at the first feasible opportunity during\na face to face visit. Nurses obtained written informed consent for the study and for the re-\nsearcher to contact them by phone to undertake the pre and post intervention outcome mea-\nsures. For the intervention group, once the researcher completed the pre-intervention outcome\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 4/1 6\nmeasures by phone with the caregiver, she informed the nurse who completed at least two visits\nimplementing the CSNAT intervention. Once the nurse completed the CSNAT visits, the re-\nsearcher was informed so post intervention outcome measures could be collected from the\ncaregiver by phone, aiming to do it within three to seven days. However this depended on how\nsoon the nurse informed the researcher and also on caregivers’availability. To ensure that this\nresearch process worked well, liaison between the researcher and the nurses occurred almost\non a daily basis. Deaths were monitored throughout the data collection period to ensure that\nbereaved carers were not contacted by phone for completing the follow-up measures, as it was\nnot sensitive to do so once patient death occurred.\nNurses were also asked to keep a record on a specially designed form of those caregivers\nwho did not participate in the study (control or intervention, gender, age and reason for non-\nparticipation).\nOutcomes\nData collection by the researcher was undertaken at the individual participant level and con-\nducted at pre and post intervention over the phone for the two groups. Outcome measures\n(Caregiver Survey) were collected by the researcher at both time points. Demographic data\nwere collected at baseline only and consisted of:\n Caregivers: age, gender, marital status, education, employment status, living arrangements,\nethnicity, relationship to patient; other caregiving responsibilities.\n Patients: age, gender, type of diagnosis, length of diagnosis, period receiving palliative care.\nPrimary outcome. The primary outcome was caregiver strain and distress as measured by\nthe 2 subscales of the Family Appraisal of Caregiving Questionnaire (FACQ-PC) where strain\nhas 8 items and distress has 4 items [25]. The appraisal of the strain subscale (also referred to\nas index of burden) includes“items that have been closely linked to outcome, namely, role\noverload (the extent to which caregivers perceive that they are physically or emotionally deplet-\ned by their caregiving activities), and role captivity (the extent to which caregivers feel trapped\nby their responsibilities and isolated)” ([25], p. 615). The distress subscale represents“negative\nemotional responses associated with caregiving such as anxiety and depression as well as feel-\nings of guilt in the caregiver-care recipient relationship” ([25], p. 616). Psychometric analyses\ndemonstrate good construct validity. Internal reliability estimates range from 0.75–0.86. Scores\nrange from 5 = strongly agree to 1 = strongly disagree.\nSecondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were caregiver mental and physical wellbeing\nas measured by SF-12v2 and caregiver workload as measured by caregiver assistance with Ac-\ntivities of Daily Living.\nThe SF-12v2 consists of 12 questions; relating to: physical health problems, bodily pain, gen-\neral health perceptions, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations and general\nmental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). Reliability estimates range\nfrom 0.93 to 0.95 [26].\nCaregiver workload was measured by the nature and extent of assistance provided by the\nfamily caregiver with a range of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs, such as feeding and toileting)\nand Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs such as transport and shopping). Scores\nare: 4 = assistance all of the time; 3 = assistance most of the time; 2 = occasional assistance;\n1 = no assistance required.\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 5/1 6\nPilot study\nThe study was first pilot tested to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the tools and the\ndata collection process by both nurses and caregivers, in one of the three service bases. Five\nnurses and 21 family caregivers participated in the pilot study for a period of four months in\n2011 and gave feedback that was incorporated in the present study. In general, completing the\nCSNAT was very acceptable to the nurses and caregivers. The Caregiver Survey, which incor-\nporated the outcome measures, was also acceptable to the caregivers in terms of content and\nlength. Recommended changes that were implemented in the present study included:\n CSNAT visits need to be undertaken by nurses every 2 weeks rather than 4 weeks to mini-\nmise attrition due to patient deaths\n Nurses reported that it was time consuming for them during their visit to explain and assist\ncaregivers to complete the Caregiver Survey. Therefore, the data collection method needed to\nchange from caregivers self-administering the Caregiver Survey and then posting it to the re-\nsearch team. Instead the research officer would assist caregivers to complete the survey via a\ntelephone call at a time that was convenient to them pre and post intervention, thus reducing\nthe burden of completing it during the nurse’s visit.\n The service decided to have more nurses involved in the larger trial to take the pressure off\nrecruiting, especially when the service encounters the same challenges experienced in the\npilot study such as higher patient workload or staff shortages in a particular time period.\nSample size\nPrevious research has found that caregivers who felt psychologically unsupported during care-\ngiving report worse mental health post bereavement (effect size 0.67) [27]. Assuming a more\nmodest effect size of 0.41 for the primary outcome measure (FACQ-PC), a sample size of 95 in\neach group (intervention and control) would give 80% power to demonstrate an effect of the\nintervention at alpha<0.05, two-tailed test between two independent groups using a standard\nRCT [28]. A design effect correction of 1.62 was then applied to the estimated sample size to\nadjust for the cluster design of the trial based on a conservative intraclass correlation coefficient\n(ICC) of 0.01 and average cluster size of 63, The resulting required sample was 308 (154 care-\ngivers per group). We also applied a correction for an estimated 30% attrition rate, resulting in\na final a priori sample size of 440, or 220 in each group. This sample size was considered feasi-\nble based on the fact that on average 200 new patient referrals are received per month.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 22. Statistical significance was determined at\nan alpha value of 0.05. Analyses of this trial were on a per protocol basis.\nContinuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables\nare reported as n (%). Baseline differences between Intervention and Control groups were as-\nsessed using Mann-Whitney U Tests for continuous variables and Chi-square tests or Fisher’s\nExact Test (where cell sizes were less 5) for categorical variables. Cohen’s d and 95% Confi-\ndence Intervals (CI) for calculating effect sizes was determined for the outcome measures.\nGeneralized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) was used to examine the efficacy of the\nCSNAT intervention from baseline to post-treatment. GLMM is a regression-based approach\nthat provides a more powerful means of analysing clustered data when compared with more\nconventional procedures for the comparison of group means by explicitly accounting for intra-\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 6/1 6\ncluster correlation [29]. Moreover, GLMM is robust to unequal group sizes, which was a signif-\nicant issue in the present study [30].\nA series of six GLMMs were run, one for each outcome. Each model included two random\neffects; Base (to account for the intra-class correlation within bases) and Time (to account for\nthe correlation between repeated observations of the same individual). Fixed effects included\nwere; Time, Base, Condition, the interaction between Time and Condition (Time x Condition),\nand the interaction between Time and Base (Time x Base). The Time × Condition interaction\neffect was the primary variable of interest in each model with a significant interaction effect in-\ndicating a differential rate of change in outcomes between the intervention and control condi-\ntions from baseline to post-treatment. Five covariates were also included in each GLMM to\nadjust for significant baseline differences between groups; Age of caregiver, effect of caring on\nwork, diagnosis of patient, length of palliative care, and length of Silver Chain admission.\nResults\nParticipant flow\nFig 2displays the participant flow for the study. In total, 620 caregivers (Intervention n = 441,\nControl n = 179) were recruited and/or referred over a time period of 24 months (March 2012\nto February 2014). The observed group imbalance was due to slow recruitment at the start of\nthe study as a result of logistical and operational service constraints, when all sites were recruit-\ning for the control group.\nThirty four individuals withdrew prior to baseline measures. Reasons for discontinuation\nincluded; patient death (n = 22), did not meet eligibility criteria (n = 9), lost to follow-up\n(n = 2) or caregiver withdrawal (n = 1). The remaining 586 caregivers (Intervention n = 423,\nFig 2.

Two hundred and thirty three participants\n(55.1%) completed the study in the intervention group and 89 (54.6%) in the control group\nafter baseline measures. The attrition rate between baseline and follow-up was similar for both\ngroups (44.9% for the intervention group and 45.4% for the control group). This rate was sig-\nnificantly higher than our estimated rate of 30%. Attrition was predominantly due to patient\ndeaths in both groups (Intervention: n = 151, 79.4% of all those withdrawn, Control: n = 68,\n91.9% of all those withdrawn). Our analyses were based on the study completers sample only\n(n = 322), or per protocol.\nCompared to drop-outs, participants who completed the study had a longer period of car-\ning, were less likely to be in paid employment, and had more from a non-English background.\nAll other demographic variables were equivalent and patient profiles did not differ.\nParticipant characteristics\nTable 1displays demographic data at baseline for family caregivers who completed the study in\nthe two groups. Caregivers did not differ between the two groups on most characteristics except\nthat the intervention participants were slightly younger than the control participants, currently\nengaged in paid employment, had care recipients with cancer diagnoses, with shorter median\nlengths of stay (LOS) with Silver Chain and shorter median LOS in palliative care.\nInformation was collected on 121 non-participants and their basic demographics did not\ndiffer from those of participants: 71% were women, mean age was 65 years and 75% were in\nthe intervention group. The predominant reasons for not participating were: too busy/over-\nwhelmed (43%), not interested (13%) and patient deteriorating or at terminal stage (8%).\nPrimary outcome: FACQ-PC\nThe intervention was associated with a significant reduction in Caregiver Strain, while control\nparticipants experienced an increase in strain over the study period (Table 2). Mean reduction\nin caregiver strain was 0.08 for intervention participants compared with an increase of 0.09 for\nthe control group after adjusting for covariates, p = 0.018,d = 0.348 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.41). Sim-\nilarly, intervention participants experienced a mean reduction of 0.10 in Caregiver Distress\nscores from baseline to follow-up, while control participants experienced a mean increase of\n0.04, although this result was not statistically significant after adjusting for covariates, p = 0.26,\nd = 0.23 (95%CI 0.11 to 0.30).\nSecondary outcomes\nThe intervention was also associated with an improvement in the SF12v2 Mental Component\nScore (MCS). Mean improvement in MCS was 1.42 for the intervention group compared with\na decrease of 0.05 for the control group, although this result was not statistically significant\nafter adjusting for covariates, p = 0.67,d = 0.16 (95%CI -1.70 to 1.40). Both groups showed a\nworsening on the SF12v2 Physical Component Score (PCS) over the two time points, but these\ndifferences were not significant (Table 2).\nBoth groups showed increased caregiver workload assisting with patient activities of daily\nliving (ADLs) from baseline. However, this increase was smaller in the intervention group for\nboth the ADL and IADL measures, though the difference between groups was not statistically\nsignificant after controlling for covariates.\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 8/1 6\nTable 1.

The\nmean period between the two visits by nurses, where CSNAT was undertaken, was 23 days\n(SD = 14), and the mean period between baseline and follow-up data collection for outcome\nmeasures was 43 days (SD = 20).\nFamily caregivers’ support needs. The top four support needs reported by family caregiv-\ners at the first and second nurse visits consisted of (Fig 3): knowing what to expect in the future\n(52%, 32% respectively), having time for yourself in the day (40%, 36% respectively), dealing\nwith your feelings and worries (33%, 28% respectively) and understanding your relative’s ill-\nness (28%, 20% respectively).\nSolutions provided. The solutions put in place by the nurses for“knowing what to expect\nin the future” consisted of discussions (using nurses’quotes) “on what to expect as [client’s]\ncondition deteriorates and death nears”, “recommended the Helpful Comfort Measures book-\nlet” or “long talk about end of life care/dying at home/ symptom management with [infusion]\npump/ extra input from care aides”. For the second priority on“having time for yourself in the\nday”, the nurses discussed \"time out\", the options of respite care, family rosters, volunteers and\npersonal alarm for the client.\nThe solutions put in place for the third priority“dealing with your feelings and worries”\nconsisted of: seeing a counsellor, a chaplain, encouragement to attend the day centre at Com-\nmunity Hospice and to call on friends for support, and referral to social worker regarding\nFig 3.

For the fourth priority“understanding your relative’s illness”,t h e\nnurses provided explanations on matters such as: signs of seizure activity and how to respond,\nmore invasive tests might be required so need to gain more information from the specialist and\nproviding information for the children from the cancer support service.\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first to test the CSNAT intervention through the caregiving period (in contrast\nto an UK trial that focused on post bereavement outcome measures [31]), using a control\ngroup, and all sites received the intervention using the stepped wedge design. The Intervention\nwas associated with a significant reduction in caregiver strain. A reduction in caregiver distress\nwas also indicated but not significant after controlling for covariates. Both groups showed an\nincrease in caregiver workload (assisting with ADLs) which was expected given the nature of\ndisease progression with time. However the intervention was associated with a smaller increase\nin caregiver workload. The differences in SF12v2 scores were not significant maybe due to\nSF12v2 not accurately capturing the outcome for the study within a short time period of the in-\ntervention or the intervention had limited effect in this case.\nThe observed significant small to moderate effect size of this intervention (d = 0.348, 95%\nCI 0.25 to 0.41) is comparable if not larger than those reported in a meta-analysis of caregiver\ninterventions by Northouse et al [32]. Specifically, reported interventions on appraisal of care-\ngiver burden had effect sizes (Hedges’g) with confidence intervals ranging from 0.08 (95% CI\n-0.19 to 0.34) to 0.22 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.35). Our obtained effect size of 0.348 means that 64% of\nthe control group would have a score below the average participant in the intervention group\n[33]. Northouse et al concluded that even though effects were small to moderate in size, these\ninterventions have significantly reduced caregivers’burden among other positive outcomes,\nand therefore they show promise of achieving clinically significant outcomes,“as these inter-\nventions produce more prepared, less distressed caregivers which in turn is likely to result in\nmore positive benefits for patients” ([32], p. 12).\nThe profile of the study sample is similar to that in many studies where family caregivers are\npredominantly women, spouses, retirees, and caring for older family members with mainly a\nmalignant disease, and in particular comparable to a study from the UK [21]. It is also worth\nnoting that the four priorities in support needs for family caregivers in this Australian study\nwere similar to those obtained in the UK study [21].\nMost of the solutions put in place had the opportunity to be enacted upon in the period be-\ntween baseline and follow-up (mean period was 43 days), as with close to half of the patients\ndying, it was not feasible to extend further the timing of obtaining the follow-up outcome mea-\nsures. By structuring and reviewing caregivers’needs 2–3 weeks apart,Fig 3gives some demon-\nstration of a steady reduction in the caregivers’perception of needs between the two CSNAT\nvisits, thus providing good evidence that some of the needs have been addressed through the\nsolutions provided. This reinforces the benefit of systematically repeating this review of needs\nusing the CSNAT approach. The single domain that revealed a rise in need over time was get-\nting a break overnight, which became important across time. This could reflect the benefit of\nrecognition by caregivers that their own needs have become more visible and acknowledged\nnow, thus feeling that their request to have a break is more legitimised [21,34].\nWe believe the intervention has targeted those it was meant for, family caregivers of patients\nin hospice care and therefore close to death. Our reported 45% attrition rate was because the\ncarers could not complete the post-intervention outcome measures due to patient deaths and\nnot because they did not have time or did not want to do the intervention. In fact the qualita-\ntive feedback obtained from the 233 family carers in the intervention group was\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 12 / 16\noverwhelmingly positive [34]. Just a few stated that they would have preferred going through\nthe CSNAT earlier to prepare them more for what is to come and some thought it was too\nearly for them to know about the challenges they are going to face. The timing of the interven-\ntion when used in routine practice (without the constraints of the research process) is a call the\nnurses will need to make and gauge the best time to introduce the CSNAT.\nLimitations and direction for future research\nPrimary limitations of the study include the high attrition rate, unbalanced groups, and the\nnon-randomised design being typical challenges reported in undertaking research in palliative\ncare [35]. As explained below, these challenges operated at three levels: the individual clinician\nlevel, the structural or organisational level, and the research trial level.\nWe had aimed to recruit 440 participants (220 per condition) at baseline, which a priori\nsample size calculations indicated would be sufficient to adequately power the trial, with an an-\nticipated 30% attrition rate. However, the observed attrition rate (45%) in the trial was greater\nthan we initially estimated, due to a high rate of patient deaths over the study period. The trial\nwas thus ultimately underpowered with a final sample size of 322 completers. Attrition rates as\nhigh as 69%, causing studies to be underpowered to detect intervention effects, were reported\nin a meta-analysis of several studies [32].\nUse of a study completers sample may also impact on interpretation of findings. Given that\nthe leading cause of attrition was patient deaths, drop outs are likely to have experienced in-\ncreased strain and distress and caregiver burden over the study period. Limiting our analyses to\nonly study completers may thus have overstated the effect of the intervention. However, we felt\nit was inappropriate to use estimation methods to replace missing data for drop-outs given the\nhigh rate of attrition and non-random nature of missing values.\nMoreover, most if not all of the drop outs (other than those due to patient deaths,Fig 2)\nwere not related to the intervention to warrant adopting a proposed approach that sits between\nintention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, which is the palliative-modified ITT analysis [36].\nThis new approach recommends including in the analysis those drop outs related to the inter-\nvention. However, the most common reasons for drop outs in our study were the progression\nof the disease or the patient reaching terminal stage. Another reason for dropping out, dis-\ncharge from the service, was the result of the service operational changes whereby clients\ndeemed not close to death were discharged and then readmitted at a later date if their condition\ndeteriorated. These changes were made due to increased demand on the service and limited re-\nsources and took effect after the first time period of recruitment for the control arm, and there-\nfore would have affected more the intervention arm.\nAnother limitation of our study was unbalanced groups, with almost three times as many\nparticipants in the intervention (n = 233) than control group (n = 89). This was due to slow re-\ncruitment at the start of the trial, when all sites were recruiting for the control group. The ser-\nvice nearly doubled (to 44) the number of nurses recruiting for the intervention to allow for\nquicker recruitment in the timeframe of the extended data collection period.\nNot all caregivers would have been approached to participate and therefore there could be a\nrisk of systematic selection bias. While we cannot rule out that gatekeeping took place, we be-\nlieve that in many cases the decision to include a caregiver in the study would have been most\nlikely influenced by the workload of the nurse on the day and how time-pressured she/he felt fit-\nting in a number of patients that need to be visited. Nurses voiced their concerns at our meetings\nabout how time consuming and burdensome the research process was, issues well reported in\nthe literature [37,38]: Consenting caregivers and then contacting the researcher to conduct the\nbaseline measurements before being able to undertake the CSNAT which would be in a second\nThe Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool Trial\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123012 April 7, 2015 13 / 16\nvisit. Moreover the majority of these nurses worked part-time or job-shared and handover issues\nwere not straightforward. However the profiles of non-participants and participants did\nnot differ.\nThe issue of unbalanced groups ultimately is an inherent limitation of the stepped-wedge\ndesign; however, GLMM is generally robust to unbalanced groups. Relatedly, the intervention\nand control groups were found significantly different on a number of baseline characteristics.\nWhile analyses were adjusted for these differences, other potential underlying biases cannot be\ncompletely ruled out.\nFinally, randomisation of intervention start times was not implemented in the present study\ndue to logistic constraints. The service base that participated in the pilot study was assigned to\nstart intervention first in the main trial in order to allow the remaining two bases a longer time\nto settle into this research study before they were ready to implement the CSNAT. Therefore,\nreadiness to participate and experience in CSNAT may present as confounders, although it is\nencouraging to note that the Time x Base interaction effect was not significant in the GLMMs\nfor all six outcomes, indicating that change in outcomes did not differ significantly\nbetween bases.\nConclusion\nDespite the described unavoidable challenges which operated at three levels, the individual cli-\nnician level, the structural or organisational level, and the research trial level, this study has\nprovided sound evidence to support everyday clinical practice. The CSNAT implementation\nled to an improvement in caregiver strain during the caregiving period within this research\ncontext. While more research is needed on the effectiveness of the CSNAT in similar and other\nsettings, the comprehensive quantitative and qualitative feedback obtained from all 233 care-\ngivers [34] in the intervention group and the 44 nurses who implemented the intervention\n(under review), has been positive and encouraging that its implementation into routine prac-\ntice can be explored in this service context.\nAs very few of such evidence-based interventions have been translated for or implemented\nin clinical practice settings, Northouse et al called for more collaborative effort between re-\nsearchers and clinicians to move efficacy studies (phase III) to effectiveness studies (phase IV)\n[32]. Only then, we may see a reduction in publications reporting negatively on family caregiv-\ning experience, nationally and internationally.\nEffective implementation of an evidence-informed tool represents a necessary step towards\nhelping palliative care providers better assess and address caregiver needs, ensuring adequate\nfamily caregiver support and reduction in caregiver strain throughout the caregiving journey.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was financially supported by an Australian Research Council linkage grant and\nSilver Chain (LP110100622).
