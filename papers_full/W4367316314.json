    "abstract": "Medical images contain complex information, and the automated analysis of medical images can greatly assist doctors in clinical decision making. Therefore, the automatic segmentation of medical images has become a hot research topic in recent years. In this study, a novel architecture called a contoured convolutional transformer (CCTrans) network is proposed to solve the segmentation problem. A dual convolutional transformer block and a contoured detection module are designed, which integrate local and global contexts to establish reliable relational connections. Multi-scale features are effectively utilized to enhance semantic feature understanding. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) is employed to evaluate experimental performance. Two public datasets with two different modalities are chosen as the experimental datasets. Our proposed method achieved an average DSC of 83.97% on a synapse dataset (abdominal multi-organ CT) and 92.15% on an ACDC dataset (cardiac MRI). Especially for the segmentation of small and complex organs, our proposed model achieves better segmentation results than other advanced approaches. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the novel method and its potential for real-world applications. The proposed CCTrans network offers a universal solution with which to achieve precise medical image segmentation.",
