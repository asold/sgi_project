  "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to develop a retrained large language model (LLM) tailored to the needs of HN cancer patients treated with radiotherapy, with emphasis on symptom management and survivorship care. Methods: A comprehensive external database was curated for training ChatGPT-4, integrating expert-identified consensus guidelines on supportive care for HN patients and correspondences from physicians and nurses within our institution’s electronic medical records for 90 HN patients. The performance of our model was evaluated using 20 patient post-treatment inquiries that were then assessed by three Board certified radiation oncologists (RadOncs). The rating of the model was assessed on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) based on accuracy, clarity of response, completeness s, and relevance. Results: The average scores for the 20 tested questions were 4.25 for accuracy, 4.35 for clarity, 4.22 for completeness, and 4.32 for relevance, on a 5-point scale. Overall, 91.67% (220 out of 240) of assessments received scores of 3 or higher, and 83.33% (200 out of 240) received scores of 4 or higher. Conclusion: The custom-trained model demonstrates high accuracy in providing support to HN patients offering evidence-based information and guidance on their symptom management and survivorship care.",
