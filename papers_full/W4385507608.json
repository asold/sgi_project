  "abstract": "The field of software security testing, more specifically penetration\\ntesting, is an activity that requires high levels of expertise and involves\\nmany manual testing and analysis steps. This paper explores the potential usage\\nof large-language models, such as GPT3.5, to augment penetration testers with\\nAI sparring partners. We explore the feasibility of supplementing penetration\\ntesters with AI models for two distinct use cases: high-level task planning for\\nsecurity testing assignments and low-level vulnerability hunting within a\\nvulnerable virtual machine. For the latter, we implemented a closed-feedback\\nloop between LLM-generated low-level actions with a vulnerable virtual machine\\n(connected through SSH) and allowed the LLM to analyze the machine state for\\nvulnerabilities and suggest concrete attack vectors which were automatically\\nexecuted within the virtual machine. We discuss promising initial results,\\ndetail avenues for improvement, and close deliberating on the ethics of\\nproviding AI-based sparring partners.\\n",
