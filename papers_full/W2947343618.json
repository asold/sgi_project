Internal and\nexternal faults and other abnormal operating conditions,\nsuch as overload, overexcitation, overvoltage and mechan-\nical stress due to loading on transformers. The transformer\nprotection schemes should disconnect the protected device\nbefore extensive damage occurs and/or power system. In\naddition to protection elements, transformer protection\nrelays should also provide thermal and through-fault mon-\nitoring functions. The electrical protection of a trans-\nformer includes differential protection, negative sequence\npercentage differential protection, combined differential\nand restricted earth protection and the backup overcur-\nrent protection schemes and the mechanical protection of\na transformer includes Buchholz relay, pressure protection\nand thermal protection.\nIn 1941, author [ 1] proposed a new type of relays using\nthe principle of harmonic restraint, which can distinguish\nbetween the magnetizing-inrush current and the internal\nfault current by their difference in the waveform shape.\nAuthors [ 2] proposed a new digital algorithm to detect\nwinding faults in single-phase and three-phase trans-\nformers. This algorithm is suitable to measure winding\ncurrents. Various operating conditions were simulated to\ntest the algorithm. In 1997, [ 3] presented a new method to\ndiscriminate internal fault current from inrush current. To\navoid unnecessary trip caused by the magnetizing inrush\ncurrent, the second harmonic component is used to block\nthe differential relays on the power transformers.\nIEC 61850 standard has developed two types of models\nbased on peer-to-peer communication, which are Sampled\nValues (SV) and Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event\n(GOOSE). IEC 61850 has magni ficent features such as high\npriority, great flexible and reliable mechanism for the fast\ntransmission events of the substation (trips commands,\nalarms or indications) [ 4].

The\nproposed method analyses the transferring time delay\nof sampled values from Non-Conventional Instrument\nTransformer (NCIT) to the differential protection IED\nusing the IEC 61850 standard network. In this re-\nsearch work, Phase-Locked Loops (PLL) technology is\nused to implement the time synchronisation between\nMerging Unit (MU) and IEDs.\nIn 2009, authors [ 6] presented a new protection scheme\nbased on IEC 61850 – 7-2 GOOSE communication. The\nproposed scheme uses analogue measurements (current\nand voltage) and digital signals between differential (87)\nand distance (21) protection functions. As soon as a loca-\ntion of the faulted equipment is identified, it is isolated by\nthe proposed new protection scheme in a coordinated\nmanner entirely by sending a trip signal to both local and\nremote breakers. Using the IEC 61850 standard technol-\no g y ,e v e r ys i n g l eI E Do ft h ep r o p o s e ds c h e m ea l s o\ndetects the faulted adjacent line, and it sends a trip\nsignal remotely to the corresponding breaker.\nThe impact of network traffic and sampling synchron-\nisation error on the performance of the transformer differ-\nential protection based on IEC 61850 standard was\ninvestigated and compared to conventional hardwired\nconnections by authors [ 7]. To test the transformer\ndifferential protection performance caused by syn-\nchronisation error between Merging Units (MU), a\ntestbed of precision time protocol (PTP) clocks, pro-\ntection IED, merging units, and Ethernet switches to\nbe investigated is developed. IEC 61850 GOOSE commu-\nnication is used to trip Circuit Breakers (CB), report the\ntap changer position and transduce differential current\nmeasurements.\nAuthors [8], provides five different methods, namely, (1)\nHarmonic Restraint (HR), (2) conventional Waveform\nIdentification (WI), (3) Fuzzy logic, (4) Wavelet analysis,\nand (5) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to discriminate\nbetween magnetizing inrush an d internal fault conditions.\nHarmonic Restraint is a typical way of restraining a trip. It\nis assumed that magnetizing-inrush contains a high level of\nsecond harmonic currents which is the HR principle of op-\neration. The HR method uses the magnitude of the second\nharmonic in the differential current and compares it to the\nmagnitude of the fundamental frequency component. The\ntripping of the differential element is blocked as soon as the\nratio exceeds the set threshold.\nThe HR method [ 2] is based on the fact that the second\nharmonic (sometimes fifth) component of the magnetizing\ninrush current is considerably larger than a typical fault\ncurrent. In traditional substations, overcurrent relays are\nused as a backup protection with time delay higher than\nthat for the main protection. However the main drawback\nto realize on backup protection is due to time delay and\nloss of selectivity which may cause serious impact on the\npower system.\nIn smart substation, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)\ncompliance with IEC61850 standard are deployed to obtain\nsampling data and state information of other IEDs through\nIEC61850 communication network which lead to improve\nthe protection performance of the backup protection.\nIn this research work, transformer current differential\nprotection using SEL487E and its backup overcurrent pro-\ntection using SEL751A, both IED ’s support IEC61850 – 7-4\nlogical nodes to share their data and communicate their\nTrip/block signals to the other IEDs on the network. This\nimproves the protection speed and reliability of the\nbackup overcurrent protection scheme using IEC61850\nGOOSE communication in comparison with traditional\nhardwired signals with longer time delay setting. There-\nfore the research work reported in [ 9] implemented\nIEC61850 standard-based differential protection scheme\nwhich sent harmonic blocking signal to backup overcur-\nrent relay during inrush current conditions to improve the\nspeed and reliability of the backup protection.\nEven-numbered harmonics (second or fourth) provide se-\ncurity during energization, while fifth-harmonic blocking\nprovides security for overexcitation conditions. The re-\nsearch work presented in this manuscript consider second\nharmonic blocking method to provide security during ener-\ngization (inrush current conditions) of both main differen-\ntial and backup overcurrent protection for transformers.\nOverexcitation conditions are not part of this research\nwork, therefore higher harmonic order such as fifth har-\nmonics onwards not considered in this research work.\nThe authors [ 10] proposed a flux-restrained differential\ncurrent for power transformer protection. In 1990, [11]p r e -\nsented an algorithm, based on HR, using discrete hartley\ntransform. Different advanced digital filtering algorithms\nsuch as Kalman filtering [ 12], Fourier-based method [ 13],\netc., are used in HR differential protection schemes.\nHowever, the HR-based method sometimes fails to\nprevent false tripping due to high second harmonic\ncomponents during internal faults. Low second-har-\nmonic components which are generated during mag-\nnetizing inrush of the transformers having modern\ncore material. Therefore, the techniques based on de-\ntection of the second/fifth harmonic component may\nnot be a proper method to discriminate between the\ninrush and fault condition on power transformers.\nDifferential protection and backup overcurrent protec-\ntion are the most proficient internal faults protection for\nthe power transformer. The differential protection uses\ndifferential currents, which result from the difference be-\ntween HV side and LV side currents and overcurrent uses\nonly primary current. Energization of transformers causes\ninrush current passing through the transformer coils [ 14].\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 2 of 15\nThe inrush current is a harmonic rich current including\nslowly decaying DC component [ 14] because of trans-\nformer core saturation which leads to overcurrent relay\nmal-operation.\nThe differential transformer protection uses a con-\nventional technique based on the second harmonic\nrestraint; however, overcurrent relay does not have\nin-built computation for harmonic function in order\nto discriminate between an internal fault and inrush\ncurrents. This leads to the trip of the elements of the\nbackup overcurrent relay due to transformer magnet-\nizing inrush current conditions which affect the\nb\na\nFig. 1 a Harmonic Blocking scheme for power transformer protection. b Physical and IEC61850 -based virtual connection for\ncurrent differential protection scheme\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 3 of 15\npower systems stability. Therefore, the research pro-\nject was motivated to develop a new method to pre-\nvent the malfunction of the backup overcurrent relay\ndue to the transformer magnetizing-inrush current\nconditions.\nThe digital protection algorithms that were proposed\nin the past for protecting power transformers have been\nfocused on using transformer differential protection.\nMost of the research work reviewed is concentrating on\nsolving the differentiation between inrush current and\ninternal faults on the main transformer protection relay\nand failed to focus on backup overcurrent. Therefore,\nthis research work is focused on IEC 61850 standard-\nbased harmonic blocking method to prevent the backup\novercurrent relay from tripping during inrush current\nconditions. This paper provides the test bench imple-\nmentation for the harmonic blocking scheme using both\nhardwired DC signal and IEC 61850 standard-based\nGOOSE message. The developed algorithm for the har-\nmonic blocking scheme is presented. Two case studies\nare studied, one for the malfunction of the SEL-751A\nIED due to TMIC and another one to prevent the trip-\nping of the SEL-751A IED due to TMIC using the har-\nmonic blocking scheme.\nFig. 2 Implementation of the Harmonic Blocking scheme\nFig. 3 Test bench setup for transformer Harmonic Blocking scheme using current differential function\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 4 of 15\n2 IEC61850 standardization to transformer\nharmonic blocking function\nIEC61850 Ethernet-based communication provides\ninteroperability between intelligent devices within the\nsubstation and allow standardized and interconnection\nof intelligent devices from different manufacturers for\nprotection, monitoring, control of the substation. Trans-\nformer differential relay (SEL487E) has both harmonic\nblocking and harmonic restraint functions to obtain\nrelay stability during transformer inrush current condi-\ntions. According to standard IEC61850 – 7-4 there are\ndedicated logical node classes and its corresponding data\nclasses for every single protection, metering and control\nfunctions. Figure 1a provides both physical hardwired\nconnection and virtual IEC61850 GOOSE message-\nbased communication for transformer differential pro-\ntection scheme.\nThe bottom section of the Fig. 1a provides physical\nhardwired connection (Black colored) and top section of\nthe Fig. 1a provide virtual connection using IEC61850\nGOOSE message-based communication (Red colored)\nfor transformer differential protection scheme. In\nIEC61850 standard each physical power system compo-\nnents (CTs, relay functions and breakers) are repre-\nsented with its corresponding logical node classes and\nits corresponding data attributes. In research work [ 9],\nlogical node HBPHAR2 or its relay word bit 87HB of\nharmonic blocking function of differential element is used\nto send IEC61850-based GOOSE message blocking signal\nto the backup overcurrent relay during transformer inrush\ncurrent conditions as shown in Fig. 1a and b respectively\nto avoid misopereation of the backup overcurrent relay\nduring inrush current conditions. The filtered differential\nrelay element blocks all phases when the harmonic magni-\ntude of any phases exceeds the harmonic setting.\n3 Test bench set-up of the harmonic blocking\nscheme\nDuring transformer energisation or recovery from a sys-\ntem fault, a substantial amount of inrush currents flows\ninto the transformer without a corresponding current\nleaving. The differential relay has the capability to detect\nFig. 4 Developed SELogic control equations in SEL-487E for harmonic blocking/restraint differential function\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 5 of 15\nan inrush condition and restrain itself from tripping.\nHowever, the overcurrent relay employed as backup pro-\ntection does not have inrush current feature.\nIn order to restrain the SEL 751A overcurrent relay\nfrom tripping during inrush conditions, a blocking\nscheme based on harmonic currents is employed. The\nscheme uses the Harmonic Blocking element (87HB) of\nthe SEL 487E IED to send a blocking signal to the SEL\n751A IED at upstream of the network to inhibit it from\ntripping during inrush conditions as shown in Fig. 1b.\nAs soon as currents are fed into the IEDs by the CTs\n(CT1, CT2 and CT3) as shown in Fig. 1b, the SEL 487E\nand SEL 751A perform Discrete Fourier Transform\n(DFT) signal processing and calculate internal protection\nfunction to determine which element is asserted and\nde-asserted. During Transformer Magnetizing Inrush\nCurrent (TMIC), if the calculated second harmonic\nvalues of the primary currents exceed the pickup or set-\nting value, the Harmonic Blocking element (87HB) of\nthe SEL 487E asserts and restrain the SEL 487E from\ntripping. While asserted, the 87HB element transmits a\nblocking signal to the SEL 751A to restrain from trip-\nping due to TMIC condition as shown in Fig. 1b. To ver-\nify and investigate the performance of the harmonic\nblocking scheme, a test bench is developed and is shown\nin Figs. 2 and 3 respectively.\nThe test bench consists of the following equipment:\nSEL 487E IED, SEL 751A IED, Omicron CMC 356 Test\nset, RUGGEDCOM RSG 2288 Ethernet switch and the\npersonal computer with AcSELerator Quickset applica-\ntion to perform engineering configuration for the nu-\nmerical relay and AcSELerator Architect IEC 61850\nengineering configuration software tool.\nIn Fig. 2, the OMICRON test set is used to inject the in-\nrush currents from channel A and B of the CMC 356 into\nthe protection IEDs (SEL-487E and SEL-751A). The S\nwinding of the SEL 487E is connected in series with the\nSEL 751A via current channel A of the CMC test set.\nThis is because the S winding of SEL-487E and the\nSEL 751A backup overcurrent relay both measure cur-\nrents on the primary winding of the power transformer.\nCMC 356 device is used to provide 110 DC voltage\nwhich is used to interlock the two IEDs (SEL-487E\nand SEL-751A) as shown in Fig. 2. The T winding sec-\nondary side of the power transformer is connected to\ncurrent channel B of the CMC 356 test set. The IEDs\n(SEL-487E and SEL-751A), CMC 35 and a laptop with\nengineering configuration tools are connected in the\nnetwork using the Ethernet protocol for substation\ncommunication.\nThe harmonic blocking scheme is implemented using\nboth hardwired signals and IEC 61850 standard-based\nGOOSE message. To achieve the harmonic blocking\nscheme, the SEL-487E and SEL-751A need to be config-\nured using the given SELogic control Eqs. ( 1)t o( 8)t o\nproduce a blocking signal whenever the harmonic block-\ning element picks up an inrush condition on any one of\nthe three phases.\nFig. 5 Developed SELogic control equations in SEL-751A for the implementation of the Harmonic Blocking scheme\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 6 of 15\nTo avoid SEL-751A relay mis-operation during inrush\nconditions the filtered differential element uses har-\nmonics to either block or restrain the differential elem-\nent. The SEL-487E relay blocks all the phases when the\nharmonic magnitude of any one of the three phases ex-\ncesses the harmonic setting. Even numbered harmonics\n(second and fourth) provide security during transformer\nenergisation, while fifth-harmonic provides security for\noverexcitation conditions. Harmonic blocking and har-\nmonic restraint provide a good balance between speed\nand security. The harmonic blocking element includes\ncommon (cross) second and fourth harmonic blocking\nand independent fifth harmonic blocking for improved\nsecurity.\nTo verify the performance of the harmonic blocking\nscheme, the scheme is implemented as depicted in\nFig. 4 below.\n4 Developed SELogic control equations for the\nharmonic blocking scheme\nIn order for the SEL 487E to generate a harmonic block-\ning signal, the following SELogic control Eqs. ( 1)t o( 3)\nwere created in AcSELerator Quickset Engineering tool:\nPLT32S ¼ 87AHBOR 87AHROR87BHBOR\n87BHROR87CHBOR87CHR ð1Þ\nPLT32R ¼ TRGTR ð2Þ\nPSV01 ¼ PLT32 ð3Þ\ngraphical logic representation of this free-form SELogic\ncontrol Eqs. ( 1)t o( 3) is shown in Fig. 4.\nFrom the Fig. 4, it is discernible that any asserted\nphase harmonic restraint or blocking elements (87HB\nor 87HR) will set the protection latch PLT32, which\nFig. 6 Flowchart for the harmonic blocking scheme\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 7 of 15\nasserts the protection SELogic variable PSV01 which\nis mapped to OUT101 output port of SEL-487E. The\nprotection latch PLT32 is used to latch in the har-\nmonic signal because either harmonic blocking or re-\nstraint elements (87HB or 87HR) do not assert\ncontinuously. The status value of the protection\nSELogic variable PVS01 is transmitted as the blocking\ns i g n a la ss h o w ni nF i g . 4.\nIn order to restrain the SEL 751A overcurrent IED\nfrom tripping during transformer inrush condition\nupon receipt of the blocking signal from SEL-487E, the\nfollowing SELogic control equations are created in\nAcSELerator Quickset:\n51P1TC ¼ NOT IN 101ORVB001ðÞ ð 4Þ\n51N1TC ¼ NOT IN 101ORVB001ðÞ ð 5Þ\n50P2TC ¼ NOT IN 101ORVB001ðÞ ð 6Þ\n50N1TC ¼ NOT IN 101ORVB001ðÞ ð 7Þ\nOUT102 ¼ NOT IN 101ORVB001ðÞ AND\n51P1TO R 51N1TO R 50P2TO R 50N1TðÞ\nð8Þ\nThe torque control elements 51P1TC, 51N1TC,\n50P2TC and 50N2TC, are used to interlock the 51P ,\n51 N, 50P and 50 N elements and avert them from\na s s e r t i n gd u r i n gi n r u s hc o n d i t i o n sa ss h o w ni nF i g .5.\nUnder normal conditions (no TMIC) the control input\nIN101 and the virtual bit VB001 carry a logical value\nof 0. Applying this logical state to a NOT gate\nproduces a high logical state, which guarantees that the\ntorque-controlled elements 51P, 51 N, 50P, and 50 N\ncan still assert if a fault o ccurs on the system. Output\n102 is also interlocked to the blocking signal to ensure\nthat no other element of the SEL-751A IED can ener-\ngise this output and pass a trip signal onto the circuit\nbreaker during inrush conditions.

To block the 50 & 51 elements from tripping dur-\ning TMIC condition, harmonic blocking scheme algo-\nrithm is implemented using hardwired, and IEC 61850\nstandard-based GOOSE message and is described in de-\ntail in this section.\nSteps to implement the harmonic blocking scheme\nalgorithm using IEC 61850 standard-based GOOSE\nmessage are as follows:\n1. SEL-487E power transformer IED performs a\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT) signal processing\nusing input current signals from the current\ntransformers CT2 and CT3 connected to S and T\nwindings respectively as shown in Fig. 1b.\nFig. 7 Second harmonic test results from Omicron test universe\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 8 of 15\n2. Calculate the internal protection function on\nSEL-487E using DFT signals from step 1.\n3. For internal faults on th e power transformer, the\ncorresponding relay word bit 87 T is asserted. SEL-\n487E performs the second-harmonic ratio calcula-\ntion in the differential cur rents, for internal faults\nobviously the 2nd harmonic will be less than the\nthreshold setting value. Relay sends a trip signal to\nthe circuit breakers CB1 and CB2 across the power\ntransformer as shown in Fig. 1b.\n4. During TMIC conditions, SEL-487E performs the\nsecond-harmonic ratio calculation again. If the 2nd\nharmonic primary current exceeds its pickup\nsetting, then the harmonic blocking elements\n(87HB and 87HR) are asserted and restrain the\nrelay from tripping.\n5. After successful completion of step 4, SEL-487E\ntransfers a magnetizing i nrush blocking (87HB)\nsignal as protection SELogic variable (PSV01) to\nSEL-751A IED using hardwired and IEC 61850\nstandard-based GOOSE message\n6. SEL-751A overcurrent IED performs a Discrete\nFourier Transform (DFT) signal and processing\nusing the input currents from the current\ntransformer CT1 connected at the primary side\nof the power transformer. SEL-751A is used as a\nbackup protection for the power transformer\nSEL-487E IED as shown in Fig. 1b\nFig. 8 a SEL-751A current signals during transformer inrush current condition. b SEL-751A trip signal during transformer inrush\ncurrent condition\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 9 of 15\n7. SEL-751A IED checks whether phase definite-\ntime overcurrent (50) or phase time-overcurrent\n(51) elements are asserted for internal events.\n8. For internal faults described in step 7 on the\nprotection zone of the power transformer, the\ncorresponding relay word bits 50 T or 51 T is\nasserted and the circuit breaker CB1 connected\nat the primary of the power transformer clears\nt h ef a u l t sa ss h o w ni nF i g . 1b.\n9. However, during TMIC condition SEL-751A\nreceives the magnetizing inrush blocking signals\ntransferred by SEL-487E from step 5 in order to\nde-assert the relay word bits 50 and 51 from\ntripping.\n10. The transfer of magnetizing inrush blocking\nsignal is implemented using hardwired DC\nsignals which are mapped to the input (IN101)\nas shown in Fig. 5 and IEC 61850 standard-based\nGOOSE message which is mapped to virtual bit\nFig. 10 a SEL-751A recorded signals during inrush current conditions. b SEL-751A overcurrent relay response during transformer\ninrush current conditions\nFig. 9 Harmonic blocking signal wiring diagram\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 10 of 15\n(VB001) as shown in Eq. ( 8)a n dt h ed i a g r a m\nshown in Fig. 5. Output 102 is interlocked to the\nblocking signal to ensure that either 50 or 51 el-\nements of the SEL-751A IED cannot energise the\noutput (OUT102).\n11. Finally, the protection speed, reliability and\nperformance of the harmonic blocking scheme\nis analysed using hardwired and IEC 61850\nstandard-based GOOSE message. A flowchart\nfor the harmonic blocking scheme algorithm is\ndepicted in Fig. 6 below. Two case studies are\nconsidered, one with the scheme implemented\nusing traditional hardwiring signals and other\nwith IEC 61850 standard-based GOOSE message\nreplacing the traditional hardwiring signals and\nthe results of each case study are presented and\ndiscussed.\n6 Simulation test results of the harmonic blocking\nscheme using hardwired signals\nThe following two case studies are investigated, they are:\n1. Case study one – Investigation of the\nmalfunction of the SEL-751A IED due to\nTransformer Magnetizing Inrush Current\n(TMIC)\n2. Case study two – Application of the harmonic\nblocking scheme to prevent malfunctioning of the\nSEL-751A due to TMIC\n6.1 Case study one: investigation of the malfunction of\nthe SEL-751A IED due to TMIC\nThis case study aims to investigate the performance of the\nSEL 751A overcurrent relay installed on the upstream of\nthe network during transformer magnetisation inrush\ncurrent conditions. The SEL-751A IED is tested without\nthe implementation of the developed harmonic blocking\nscheme. There is a high harmonic content in the inrush\ncurrents; however, the fault currents have less harmonic\ncontents that are less than 15%. Therefore, the way to test\nthe inrush current condition is by generating differential\ncurrents with harmonic content above 15%. The omicron\nCMC 356 test set is used to inject currents with a 2nd har-\nmonic level percentage of 16.60% into the SEL-487E and\nSEL-751A IEDs respectively as shown in Fig. 7.\nThe pickup differential current is set to 0.5 A and CT\nratio set to 400A at the primary side of the power trans-\nformer, the test factor selected is 6.10 times the nominal\ncurrent (6.10 X 400A) = 2440A. Therefore, the Omicron\nsecond harmonic simulation currents for L1-L2-L3 to be\ninjected to the IEDs is (2440A X 0.5) = 1220A. The re-\nsults obtained from the hardwired simulation test are\npresented in Fig. 8a and b respectively. Figure 8a shows\nthat 16.60% of the 2nd harmonic currents injected in\nboth IEDs (SEL-487E and SEL-751A), in which\nSEL-751A IED picks up this injected 2nd harmonic\ncurrent as a fault by asserting inverse time-overcurrent\n(51P1P) and FAULT elements at 5.95 s.\nIn Fig. 8b, shows that the inverse definite minimum\ntime element 51P1 of SEL 751A overcurrent relay\nFig. 11 Implementation of the harmonic blocking scheme using IEC 61850 standard-based GOOSE message\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 11 of 15\nasserted for the 2nd harmonic inrush current which\nproduces a trip signal (51P1T) at 0.36 s (6.31 s – 5.95\ns = 0.36 s). It is also evident from the Fig. 8bt h a tn o\nblocking signal sent to SEL-751A IED from SEL-487E\nin order to restrain the TRIP and 51P1T elements\ndue to TMIC conditions.\n6.2 Case study two: application of the harmonic blocking\nscheme to prevent malfunctioning of the SEL-751A due\nto TMIC using hardwired signals\nThe aim of this case study is to investigate the har-\nmonic blocking scheme during transformer inrush\nconditions. This scheme uses a 110 V DC signal\nlooped between SEL 751A and SEL 487E IEDs as\nshown in Fig. 9. The 110 V DC signal is wired in series\nwith the normally open output contact OUT101 of the\nSEL 487E as shown in Fig. 9. The normally open contact,\nthat is output 102 of the SEL 487E is mapped to the pro-\ntection SELogic variable PSV01 and transition to a closed\nposition and pass the blocking signal to the control input\nCCIN101 of the SEL 751A when PSV01 asserts.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, the relay is tested with the devel-\noped harmonic blocking scheme. The omicron CMC\n356 test set is used to inject differential currents with\n16.60% of 2nd harmonic content into the IEDs. The re-\nsults obtained from the hardwired test simulation is\ngiven in Fig. 10a and b respectively.\nFigure 10a shows that 16.60% of the 2nd harmonic\ncurrents injected in both IEDs SEL-487E and\nFig. 12 a Inrush current condition monitored from SEL-751A. b Harmonic blocking signal recorded by SEL-751A\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 12 of 15\nSEL-751A respectively, in which SEL-751A IED picks\nup this injected 2nd harmonic current as a fault by\nasserting inverse time-overcurrent (51P1P) and\nFAULT elements at approximately 4.45 s.\nFigure 10b shows that the pickup elements 51P1P and\nFAULTS are de-asserted at 5.50 s, and the SEL-751A\nrelay does not produce any trip signal. This is because\nthe overcurrent elements are being blocked from assert-\ning by the blocking signal being received through con-\ntrol input IN101. The results of this test also indicate\nthat the malfunctioning caused by transformer magnet-\nisation inrush currents can be prevented by implement-\ning the harmonic blocking scheme.\n7 Implementation of the harmonic blocking\nscheme using IEC 61850 standard-based GOOSE\nmessage\nHarmonic blocking scheme test bench implementation\nto prevent the operation of the SEL-751A overcurrent\nelements (51P1 & 50P1) during the transformer mag-\nnetizing inrush current conditions is given in Fig. 11.\nOmicron CMC356 test set is used to inject the inrush\ncurrents into the SEL 487E and SEL 751A IEDs. The S\nwinding of the SEL 487E is connected in series with the\nSEL 751A current inputs. This is because the S winding\nand the SEL 751A backup overcurrent relay both meas-\nure the current on the primary winding of the protected\ntransformer. The RUGGEDCOM Ethernet switch links\nthe two protective IEDs with the personal computer and\nthe CMC 356 test via a virtual local area network VLAN.\nThe harmonic blocking (87HB) signal is transmitted\nthrough Ethernet as a GOOSE message to block the\ntorque control overcurrent elements (50/51 TC) as\nshown in Fig. 11.\n7.1 Simulation results analysis of the harmonic blocking\nscheme using IEC 61850 standard-based GOOSE message\nThe GOOSE simulation results of the developed har-\nmonic blocking scheme are shown in Fig. 12. An inrush\ncurrent with 16.60% of the harmonic level is injected\ninto the IEDs.\nEven-numbered harmonics (second or fourth) provide\nsecurity during energization, while fifth-harmonic block-\ning provides security for overexcitation conditions. The\nresearch work presented in this manuscript consider sec-\nond harmonic blocking method to provide security dur-\ning energization (inrush current conditions) of both\nmain differential and backup overcurrent protection for\ntransformers. Overexcitation conditions are not part of\nthis research work, therefore higher harmonic order\nsuch as fifth harmonics onwards not considered. This re-\nsearch work consider second harmonic blocking method\nto provide security and block the main differential and\nbackup overcurrent relays during transformer inrush\ncurrent conditions.\nThe analogue and digital signals recorded during\nthe simulation are shown in Fig. 12a and b respect-\nively. From Fig. 12a, it is observed that with a 16.60%\nsecond harmonic currents are injected in both IEDs\nSEL-487E and SEL-751A respectively. SEL-751A relay\nthis picks up as fault by asserting 51P1P and FAULT\nelements at 8.250 s.\nIn Fig. 12b, the digital signals 51P1P represents the\nphase Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) element.\n51P1P element asserts when the fault on the system and\n51P1T should assert when the element issues a trip sig-\nnal. VB001 is the virtual SELogic protection variable that\nis mapped to the incoming GOOSE message from\nSEL-487E received at 9.170 s. It is evident that upon\nFig. 13 Inrush current condition recorded by SEL-487E\nKrishnamurthy and Elenga Baningobera Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:10 Page 13 of 15\nreceipt of the GOOSE message, the 51P1P element\ndropped out, preventing the relay from issuing a trip sig-\nnal during TMIC condition. The signals recorded by\nSEL-487E during the fault are shown in Fig. 13.\nIn Fig. 13, harmonic blocking element (87HB)\ndigital signal and the pro tection SELogic variable\n(PSV01) configured to transmit a harmonic blocking\nGOOSE message signal during an inrush condition.\nA l t h o u g ht h eh a r m o n i cb l o c k i n ge l e m e n t8 7 H Ba s -\nserts and de-asserts, the state of the protection\nSELogic variable PSV01 remains stable. These be-\ncause the signal is sealed in the SELogic protection\nlatch PLT 32 Eqs. ( 1)t o( 3) as soon as the harmonic\nblocking element asserts for the first time.\nThe results of the IEC 61850 GOOSE message-based\nsimulation prove that the harmonic blocking scheme can\nbe employed to prevent the tripping of the SEL-751A relay\nmalfunction due to the transformer magnetisation inrush\ncurrent condition as shown in Fig. 13. Hardwired and\nGOOSE simulation results are analysed. The simulation\nresults proved that IEC61850 standard-based protection\nscheme is faster than the hardwired. Table 1 provides the\nhardwired and GOOSE blocking signals times.\nTherefore, the performance of the protection speed\nand reliability are improved using the IEC61850\nstandard-based GOOSE applications to the transformer\ndigital protective relaying system and the installation\nand maintenance expenditure are reduced.\n8 Conclusion\nThe IEC 61850 GOOSE message and hardwired\nsignals-based simulation study was conducted in the lab,\nand various faults pertaining to power transformers were\nsimulated using the omicron test injection device, and\nrelay performance was monitored. The implementation\nof the lab-scale test bench setup for transformer protec-\ntion is presented in Fig. 3.\nThis paper presents the practical implementation of\nthe IEC 61850 standard based transformer protection\nscheme. The scheme applies IEC 61850 GOOSE mes-\nsaging to send a harmonic blocking scheme from the\nSEL-487E differential IED to the SEL-751A overcur-\nrent IED during the transformer magnetizing inrush\ncurrent condition.\nIn addition to that, the developed algorithm for the har-\nmonic blocking scheme is presented in this paper. The\ntest bench setup is implemented for both hardwired DC\nsignals and IEC 61850 GOOSE message signals for har-\nmonic blocking for transformer differential elements. Two\ncase studies are simulated in order to analyse the perform-\nance of the transformer protection speed, security and\nreliability of the developed harmonic blocking scheme.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors acknowledge Cape Peninsula University of Technology to offer the\nfacilities to carry out this research work at CSAEMS.\nFunding\nThis research work was funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF)\nTHRIP grant TP2011061100004, ESKOM TESP (Capacitor Banks Placement),\nESKOM Academy of Learning, ESKOM Power Plants Energy Institute (EPPEI) and\nCPUT (Prestigious Project) grant for the Centre of Substation Automation and\nEnergy Management Systems (CSAEMS) development and growth.\nAvailability of data and materials\nNot applicable.\nAuthors’ contributions\nSK supervised this research work and participated in development of the\nharmonic blocking algorithm for power transformers and helped to draft the\nmanuscript.
