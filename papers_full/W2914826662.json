INTRODUCTION\nState-of-the-art power conversion applications linking grids\nand distributed sources, such as solid state transformer (SST)\napplications, tend to have a relatively low power rating\ncompared to conventional utilities connected to a grid in\nthe medium-voltage level [1]–[5]. One of the SST appli-\ncations developed in support of the U.S Department of\nEnergy, the Transformerless Intelligent Power Substation\n(TIPS) application, consists of a three-level neutral point\nclamped (NPC) converter on the high voltage (HV) side with\nparalleled 3-phase inverters in a high frequency six-step mode\non the low voltage (LV) side [1]–[3]. An 11 kV DC signal\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Yuhao Liu.\nfrom the 3-phase rectiﬁer is stepped-down to 400 V DC\nthrough the DC-DC conversion stage, as indicated in Table 1.\nThe speciﬁc operating condition requires that the power con-\nversion systems to be electrically isolated and handle a high\nratio of voltage to current. As a laboratory prototype for the\nDC-DC stage of TIPS, a three-level NPC converter on the\nHV side is replaced by 3-phase inverters on the LV side and a\n3-port 3-phase wye-wye-delta (Yyd) DAB DC-DC converter\nis introduced, as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe 3-phase concept is applied to dual-active bridge (DAB)\nconverters, which are used mostly in low voltage appli-\ncations based on the wye-wye (Yy) connection. However,\nmost distribution transformers in the medium voltage range\nbelong in the vector group Yd11 (IEC60076-1) because\nthere are always third-harmonic components.

Configuration of 3-port 3-phase bidirectional DAB converter in\nYyd connection.\na delta connection is preferred to provide a path for 3rd-\nharmonic current components in 3-phase systems. Conceptu-\nally, the same principles apply to the 3-port 3-phase isolated\nDAB converter for solid state transformer (SST) applications\nconverting thousands of volts to secondary voltages.\nThe medium voltage on the HV side and high current on the\nLV side during high frequency switching operations makes\nthe design of the DC-DC conversion stage challenging. In this\ntopology, the 10 kHz switching operation at 5.5 kV on the\nHV side is handled by 15 kV SiC n-IGBTs (insulated-gate\nbipolar transistors) developed by Cree. The high current on\nthe LV side during DAB operation is the largest source of\nsystem losses [6]; hence the parallel-connected converters\nshare the current on the LV side and reduce losses and stresses\nin power devices. The operating principles used here are\nbased on the phase shift modulation (PSM) scheme of a DAB\nconverter, which mitigates stresses on power devices by using\nsoft-switching (zero-voltage switching (ZVS)) [7].\nReduction of the size of the reactive components of the\nDC-DC stage is the key to realize a compact SST system.\nThe ﬁlter network in the DC-DC stage in the topology is\nformed by a large number of isolation transformers and ﬁlter\ninductors. DAB operations require a certain amount of series\ninductance between converters, which includes leakage mag-\nnetic energy stored in the isolation transformers, to transfer\na required range of power. Particularly, the high voltage to\ncurrent ratio of the application requires the converters to have\nrelatively large values of inductance, whose value is usually\nnot in the range of the leakage inductance of conventional\ntransformers. In many cases, the required ﬁlter inductance\nis realized by measuring the parasitic inductances of the\nconduction path of the circuit, which consist mainly of the\nleakage inductance of the isolation transformers, and then\nadding external inductors to make up the remaining value\nrequired. Therefore, the isolation transformers play a critical\nrole in DAB operations for overall system performance and\nsize.\nThe isolation transformers for the application DAB sys-\ntem we consider were built and tested with an additional\nnine inductors [8]. Not only are the transformers and induc-\ntors bulky, but signiﬁcant oscillation occurs in the voltage\nand current waveforms during 10 kHz switching operations.\nConnections are signiﬁcant sources of the parasitic compo-\nnents, electromagnetic (EM) interference, and losses in high\nfrequency operations. As operating frequency and voltage\nincrease, adding a part and its accessories requires an addi-\ntional dedicated design effort. To circumvent these issues,\nthe large number of ﬁlter inductors is removed by integrating\nﬁlter inductors into the isolation transformers.\nThe isolation transformer has to provide a proper 3-port\nﬁlter network to transfer power between the LV and HV sides\nof the converter. Bidirectional power ﬂow between any two\nports is equally possible in magnetically coupled windings.\nIn order to obtain desirable power ﬂows between ports with-\nout additional inductors, the leakage inductances have to be\ndesigned to form the desired ﬁlter network.\nThe desirable features and requirements of the ﬁlter net-\nwork for the 3-port 3-phase isolated DAB converter are as\nfollows:\n1. Bidirectional power ﬂow of the 3-port network should\noccur between the LV and HV sides (port 1 ↔port 2,\nand port 1 ↔port 3).\n2. Soft-switching ZVS regions are maximized.\n3. The circulating current between port 2 and 3 through\nthe DC link on the LV side is minimized.\n4. The ﬁlter inductances are fully integrated with the iso-\nlation transformers so that the large number of external\ninductors, connections, and accessories are eliminated.\n5. Low proﬁle geometry is preferred to make the system\nmodular and to effectively handle thermal dissipation.\nThe geometry and conﬁguration of the proposed isola-\ntion/ﬁlter transformer in this paper has a variety of advantages\nfor 3-port 3-phase DAB converter applications. A shell-type\nplanar shape is selected so that the magnetic ﬁelds are guided\nby high permeability magnetic cores and can be adjusted\nto the design values in an analytical manner. The leakage\nmagnetic ﬁeld between windings becomes predictable and\nadjustable by utilizing geometry and winding arrangement.\nThe ﬁlter network is fully designed and integrated with the\nisolation transformers, and power ﬂow is controlled between\nthe LV and HV sides by applying the introduced method.\nThis paper also investigates the steady state circuit behav-\nior of the 3-port 3-phase DAB converters of the TIPS\nsystem with the introduced isolation/ﬁlter transformer in\nSection II.

FILTER NETWORK MODELS OF THE 3-PORT SYSTEM\nIt is meaningful to understand the system behavior with\nfundamental frequency components, which has a dominant\nimpact on system performance and simpliﬁes analysis in\naid of vector notation. A port network is used for circuit\nanalysis with terminals carrying equal and opposite currents.\nThe 3-port system is represented by an impedance or admit-\ntance model when the system is a lossless and linear as shown\nin Fig 2.\nThe 3-port 3-phase DAB converters with a ﬁlter network\ncan be seen as a 3-port system with the 3×3 impedance\nmodel. The effect of the capacitances and resistances of the\npower conversion system is ignored as a parasitic effect;\nhence, the impedance model can be seen as pure 3×3 induc-\ntance model in (1).\n\n\nL11 L12 L13\nL21 L22 L23\nL31 L32 L33\n\nd/dt\n\n\ni1\ni2\ni3\n\n=\n\n\nv1\nv2\nv3\n\n (1)\nThe 3-port 3-phase DAB DC-DC converter is simpli-\nﬁed to a one-line diagram with three independent voltage\nsources and three lumped inductances in a wye or delta-type\nequivalent circuit, respectively [11], as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe simpliﬁed circuit models are not theoretically perfect\nrepresentations of the 3×3 inductance matrix [13], [14].\nHowever, the wye or delta-type equivalent circuit and deriva-\nFIGURE 4.

Bidi-\nrectional power ﬂow between any two ports is equally possi-\nble, and the direction is determined by the phase displacement\nin (2).\nPij =ViVj sin θij\nωLdij\n, Qij =Vi(Vi −Vj cos θij)\nωLdij\n(2)\nThe magnitude of the real and reactive power is determined\nby the magnitude of voltage, inductance values in the ﬁlter\nnetwork, and the phase displacement. Note that two important\nsystem parameters in the PSM control scheme to determine\nthe power ﬂow of DAB; these are the control parameter\n(the phase shift ‘θ ps’), and the ﬁlter inductance values. The\nDC link voltages are ﬁxed in the application but also are\nadjustable by the transformer turns ratio in practice. The real\npower is always zero when there is no phase displacement\nbetween voltages. However, reactive power circulates when\nthe excited voltages are different, as seen deﬁned in (2).\nConsidering the two voltage sources connected with a\nseries inductor in Fig. 4(a), which is a branch of the delta-type\nequivalent circuit, the line current always lags v1 and leads\nv2 when the magnitude of the voltage vectors are is the\nsame. During this operating condition, the power devices of\nleading bridges are turned on while the anti-parallel diode is\nconducting. The voltage seen from the power device is nearly\nzero during the switch-on transition, which is called zero-\nvoltage switching (ZVS). ZVS is one of the essential prop-\nerties of DAB converters to that make this topology suitable\nto for high-power and high frequency operations;. therefore,\na suitable transformer turns ratio and control strategy should\nbe determined in order to maximize the range of ZVS in the\noperation region.\nB. POWER CONTROL STERATEGY FOR 3-PORT 3-PHASE\nDAB CONVERTER IN Yyd CONFIGURATION\nThe turns-ratio of the transformer provides a degree of\nfreedom when choosing the buck-boost gain of the DAB\nconverter. The buck-boost conversion ratio changes the oper-\n19680 VOLUME 7, 2019\nS. Baek, S. Bhattacharya: Isolation Transformer for 3-Port 3-Phase DAB Converters in Medium Voltage Level\nFIGURE 5.

The buck-boost gain of the DAB converter ‘d ’\nis preferred to be unity from the HV side to the LV side so\nthat the magnitude of the voltage of each port is the same,\nwhich will maximize the ZVS soft-switching region. In other\nwords, the turns ratio among the three windings is preferred to\nbe equal to the voltage ratio among the three voltage sources.\nThe wye-delta connection in a 3-phase system inherently\nhas a magnitude change of\n√\n3 and phase displacement of\nπ/6 (30 ◦), as shown in Fig. 4(b); hence, the mismatch has to\nbe compensated for by active switching control of the bridge\nand by the turns ratio of the windings. In order to ensure that\nthere is no real power circulating within the LV side through\nthe DC link, the phase shift angle between port 1 and port 3\nis always another π/6 higher than the control variable ‘θ ps’.\nHence, the turns ratios between port 1, port 2, and port 3 in a\nYyd conﬁguration should be 55:4:4\n√\n3 ejπ/6 to consider the\nfactor of\n√\n3 ejπ/6 in the Yd connection on the LV side.\nFurthermore, the ﬁlter inductance Ld13 is inversely propor-\ntional to the magnitude of the circulating current i23. Hence,\nLd13 in the delta-type equivalent circuit is preferred to be large\nand ideally ignorable in the parallel connection. Considering\nthese points, Fig. 5 shows the most desirable conﬁguration in\none-line diagram form.\nC. OPERATIONS OF 3-PORT 3-PHASE DAB CONVERTER IN\nYyd CONFIGURATION\nThe three voltage sources in Fig. 5 are replaced by three\n3-phase inverters in high frequency six-step mode in the real\nsystem. The phase voltages generated by six-step 3-phase\ninverters in wye and delta connections are multi-level square\nwaveforms, as shown in Fig. 6. Phase shift modulation is\napplied using the control variable ‘θ ps’ with gating signals\nhaving a duty ratio of 0.5. From Fig. 6, the actual voltage\nv1,v2,v3 and current i12,i23,i31 waveforms in the delta-type\nequivalent circuit are calculated and shown for the Yy and Yd\nconnections, respectively [9], [10]. Windings 1, 2, and 3 have\nthe number of turns set as 55:4:7, and the additional phase\ndisplacement of π/6 is applied between port 1 and 3.\nThe fundamental and harmonic components of the phase\nvoltage of port 2 in the wye connection are represented in\nsine series form in (3).\nv2an =V2dc\n2\nπ\n(\nsin (ωt)+1\n5 sin (5ωt)+1\n7 cos (7ωt)\n+1\n11 cos (11ωt)..\n)\n(3)\nThe fundamental and harmonic components of the phase\nvoltage of port 3 in the delta connection with additional phase\nshift π/6 are derived as\nv3ab =\n√\n3V2dc\n2\nπ\n(\nsin (ωt)−1\n5 sin (5ωt)−1\n7 sin (7ωt)\n+1\n11 sin (11ωt)..\n)\n.

DESIGN OF THE FILTER NETWORK FOR 3-PORT\n3-PHASE DAB CONVERTERS\nA. GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION WITH TERMINAL\nLEAKAGE INDUCTANCES OF 3-WINDING TRANSFORMERS\nThe ﬁlter network is determined by the geometrical infor-\nmation, winding arrangement, and the characteristics of the\nmaterials. A 1-dimentional approximation is used to achieve\nthe aforementioned desirable features. Finally, 3-dimensional\nFEM models are used to validate the design as a post-process.\nFirst, the geometry of the magnetic cores must be symmetric\nand shielded by high permeability material in order to effec-\ntively guide the magnetic ﬂux path. The shell-type conﬁgura-\ntion conﬁnes the leakage magnetic ﬂux in the window area in\nuniform manner, as shown in Fig. 7. The planar shape reduces\na portion of the parasitic effect from the edges and increases\nthe accuracy of the 1-dimensional calculations.\nA variety of advantages applicable to planar magnetics\nincluding good thermal characteristics and modular capabil-\nity is known in the literature [12]. A trapezoidal shape of\nmagnetic ﬁeld intensity is formed in the window area when\nthe current in the winding is evenly distributed in a sequential\nmanner, as shown in Fig. 7. The stored magnetic energy in the\nwindow area is\nEtij =1\n2Ptiji2 =l\n∫ w\n0\nH(x)dx, (10)\nwhere ‘l ’ is the length of the core in the z direction.\nFIGURE 7. 3-winding shell-type transformer and trapezoidal leakage\nmagnetic field intensity (H) distribution in window area.\nFIGURE 8. Terminal leakage inductance measurements. (a) Lt12 (v2 =0,\ni3 =0). (b) Lt13, v3 =0, i2 =0. (c) Lt23, v3 =0, ii =0.\nTerminal leakage inductances Lt are meaningful and mea-\nsurable parameters of an isolation transformer in practice.\nThe terminal leakage inductances are measured using two\nwindings at a time by shorting the relevant winding and\nopening the last winding, as shown in Fig. 8. The permeance,\n‘P’, a measure of the magnetic ﬂux for one turn, is used\ninstead of inductance ‘L ’ in the following calculations.\nThe terminal leakage permeance is calculated from the\ntrapezoidal magnetic ﬂux distribution when the current in\nthe winding is evenly distributed in sequential manner,\nas expressed in (11).\n\n\n\nPt12 =(d1 +d2 +3d12)k\nPt31 =(d1 +d3 +3d13)k\nPt23 =(3d1 +d2 +d3 +3d12 +3d13)k\n(11)\nHere k =µol\n3h Ptij =Pyi +Pyj,(Ltij =N2\ni Ptij)\nHence, the circuit element of wye and delta-type equiva-\nlent circuit is represented by geometrical parameters in (12)\nand (13), as shown at the bottom of the next page, respec-\ntively.\nThe terminal permeance values in the wye/ delta equiv-\nalent circuit models are not mathematically consistent. The\nequivalent model of mutually-coupled inductors is com-\npatible with terminal permeance measurements, and hence\nis applied in Fig. 9. The equivalent circuit is represented\nby the impedance matrix including the magnetic coupling\nM =−P y1 in (14).\n[Pt12 Py1\nPy1 Pt13\n]\nd/dt\n[i2\ni3\n]\n=\n[v21\nv31\n]\n(14)\n19682 VOLUME 7, 2019\nS.

Equivalent circuit model of a 3-winding transformer.\nThe mutually coupled current does not go into port 1, as is\ncase for circulating current i23 in the delta-type equivalent\ncircuit. Note that all permeances are proportional to ‘k ’ and\nthe ﬁnal permeance values will be double, considering the\nreturn path of shell-type cores.\nB. FILTER INDUCTANCE INTERGRATION OF A 3-WINDING\nPLANAR TRANSFORMER FOR A Yyd 3-PORT 3-PHASE\nDC-DC CONVERTER\nThe power ﬂows between ports 1 and 2 and between ports 1\nand 3 are determined by the series permeances and control\nparameter θps. Pd12 and Pd31 are preferred to be similar\nvalues to share current evenly in paralleled bridges, and are\nrequired to be within a certain range to transfer a speciﬁc\namount of power. Hence, winding 1 in the middle between\nwindings 2 and 3 is used as the isolation transformer on the\nHV side and windings 2 and 3 are used for the windings of\nthe parallel-connected inverters on the LV side. The coupling\nM is relatively weak based on the geometry, and provides no\ncontribution to real power ﬂow in the application. Hence, the\ndesirable ﬁlter network with two permeance elements, Pt12\nand Pt31, is reasonable.\nThe shell-type planar transformer has a predictable mag-\nnetic path, while the leakage inductance values can be ampli-\nﬁed by shortening the leakage magnetic path in the window\narea. The height to length ratio of the planar shape adjusts\nthe permeance values. The dimensions l,h,d are selected to\nproduce the inductance values that DAB operation requires.\nThe symmetric conﬁguration produces similar terminal per-\nmeances between ports 1 and 2 and between ports 1 and 3.\nThis winding arrangement is beneﬁcial for balancing current\nsharing on the two bridges connected in parallel. Therefore,\nthe proposed geometry and design method for the isolation\ntransformer allows us to integrate and replace the large num-\nber of bulky inductors required for DAB operations while\nachieving the intended power ﬂow.\nThe prototype transformer was designed with a width/\nheight ratio of 21.7 to achieve the two similar terminal induc-\ntances Lt12 and Lt31 of 12 mH referred to the HV side. The\nspeciﬁcations and dimensions of the magnetic cores are listed\nin Table 2. Computer-aided drawings of the prototype were\nused for fabrication. The FEM analysis structure is illustrated\nin Fig. 10. There are a variety of design factors affecting the\nmagnetics design; therefore, further optimization is expected\nby conducting parametric studies.\nIV. DESIGN VALIDATION USING FEM\nA.

Baek, S. Bhattacharya: Isolation Transformer for 3-Port 3-Phase DAB Converters in Medium Voltage Level\nTABLE 2. Prototype dimensions [mm].\nTABLE 3. Terminal permeances and inductances referred to HV side.\nwere used to extract terminal inductances. The geometry\nand speciﬁcations in Table 1 and Table 2 were used. Half\nof the model was drawn by setting a symmetric boundary\ncondition to reduce computational load and time, as shown\nin Fig. 10(b). The size of the mesh of the magnetic cores\non the MC1 was limited to within 1 mm, which is 1/150 of\nthe width of the cores, to ensure the accuracy of curves and\ngaps. Three core sections, CS1, CS2, and CS3, were deﬁned\nand used to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld. The measurement\nconditions of terminal permeances are set by exciting currents\non two windings in the opposite direction. The static magnetic\nﬁeld distributions and mesh sizes for each measurement are\nshown in Fig. 11. The magnetic ﬁelds are guided by high\npermeability magnetic cores and the magnetic ﬁeld inten-\nsity is conﬁned in the window area in a uniform manner,\nas designed.\nThis laboratory prototype of the 3-winding transformer\nfor a 5.5 kV to 400 V DC-DC stage is designed for TIPS\napplication, and results are shown in Fig. 12. Nanocrystalline\nmagnetic cores were customized to operate at 10 kHz with\nhigh efﬁciency. Litz wires were used to reduce eddy and\nproximity effects on the windings. The bobbin is made of\nTeﬂon with 5.5 kV insulation. The calculated and measured\npermeance and inductance values from the prototype are\ncompared in Table 3. The terminal leakage inductances were\nmeasured by an Agilent 4294A. Both the FEM results in\nthree dimensions and analytical calculation results show good\nagreement. The measured values are reasonably within the\nexpected range considering the imperfections of the manu-\nfacturing process and material properties. The measured Lt23\nvalue is approximately 70% of the FEM result and does not\ncontribute to real power transfer.\nFIGURE 10.

FEM TRANSIENT SOLUTIONS\nThe operational principles and analysis with the proposed\nmethod are veriﬁed by a FEM transient solver. The same\ndrawings and setups for the magnetostatic solver are applied\nto the Ansys Maxwell3D transient solver. The phase voltages\nare directly applied to transformer windings without addi-\ntional inductances. Hence, the magnetic energy stored by line\ncurrents during DAB operation is solely due to the leakage\ninductances of the transformer. The phase voltages and phase\ncurrents referred to the HV side are shown in Fig. 13. The\naverage values of the magnetic ﬁeld over the cross sectional\nareas, Bavg_CS1, Bavg_CS2, and Bavg_CS3 are calculated based\non (15).\nBavg = 1\nACS\n∫\nACS\n⃗B ·⃗ndA (15)\n19684 VOLUME 7, 2019\nS.

H-field distributions (a) Pt12 with excitation of 1A (b) Pt31\nwith excitation of 1A (c) Pt23 with excitation of 1A.\nNote that the location of CS1 on the x axis is in the\nmiddle of winding 1, and CS2 and CS3 are located between\nwindings. Bavg_CS1 is almost constant with time regardless\nof change in load conditions (Fig. 13), which indicates that\nBavg_CS1 is not affected by line currents. The location of CS1\nis such that the two leakage magnetic paths are balanced and\ncancel each other; thus, Bavg_CS1 can be used as an indication\nof magnetic ﬁelds for mutual coupling. When θps is 20◦under\nlight load conditions, Bavg_CS2 and Bavg_CS3 are almost the\nsame as Bavg_CS1 in Fig. 13(a).\nThe magnetic ﬁeld distribution in the magnetic cores under\nheavy load conditions with θps =60◦is shown in Fig. 13(c).\nFIGURE 12. Prototype of isolation/filter transformer for 3-Port 3-phase\nDC-DC converter in Yyd connection.\nThe line currents reach peak values at approximately 35us\nwith θps =60◦and Bavg_CS2 and Bavg_CS3 are almost zero\nbecause the magnetic ﬁeld is almost horizontal to the cross\nsectional area owing to the strong magnetic ﬁeld induced\nby line currents along the leakage paths in Fig. 14. The\nline current at 10us is close to zero in Fig. 13(c), where\nBavg_CS1, Bavg_CS2, and Bavg_CS3 cross over, indicating that\nthe magnetic ﬁeld induced by line currents along the leakage\npaths does not exist. Hence, the magnetic ﬁeld distribution\nshown in the plot at 10us in Fig. 14 is mainly formed by\nmutual coupling and the magnetic ﬁelds in the cores are well\naligned in a uniform manner.\nThe amount of power transfer from each winding per phase\nis calculated by the phase current and voltage waveforms\nFIGURE 13. 3D FEM transient solutions – waveforms in time (time step =0.5us).

The sign of\nthe power on each port indicates the direction of power ﬂow.\nThe amount of power on the LV side is evenly distributed on\neach branch and transferred to the HV side. Approximately\n14.21 kW per phase is transferred between HV and LV sides\nwith a phase shift of 60 ◦.\nThere are local magnetic ﬁeld congestions near the\nedges; however most core regions are in the 0.4 T range\nof the peak to peak value. The nonlinear BH curve\nof nanocrystalline cores is applied to FEM simulations;\nhowever the results do not produce considerable changes\nbecause the operating conditions are well within the linear\nregion of the core material which has its saturation point\naround 1.2T.\nThe magnetic ﬁeld induced by line currents in the leakage\npaths can generate additional losses near CS2 and CS3 in lam-\ninated structure, which become orthogonal to the lamination\nand induce eddy currents. Hence, further study in efﬁciency\nTABLE 5. Test conditions.\nFIGURE 15.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, the 3-winding shell-type isolation/ﬁlter trans-\nformer has been designed for the 3-port 3-phase DAB con-\nverter in Yyd connection for SST applications. The isolation\ntransformer introduced in this paper functions not only as an\nisolation transformer but also as inductive ﬁlters for 3-port\nﬁlter network. The power ﬂow characteristics of the con-\nverter operation is analyzed through equivalent circuit model\nwith terminal leakage inductances. The desirable power ﬂows\nbetween the three ports of the converter topology are obtained\nby manipulating the isolation transformer with a full inte-\ngration of ﬁlter network. The proposed design and anal-\nysis of the isolation/ﬁlter transformer is veriﬁed by FEM\nsimulations. The operation principles and the feasibility of\nisolation transformer as a ﬁlter network for the 3-port 3-phase\nDC-DC converter in Yyd connection is proven by experimen-\ntal results.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
