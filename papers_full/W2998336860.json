One of the biggest technical challenges with sequencing data is to map millions of reads to a\nreference genome. This problem is exacerbated when dealing with repetitive sequences such as transposable\nelements that occupy half of the mammalian genome mass. Sequenced reads coming from these regions introduce\nambiguities in the mapping step. Therefore, applying dedicated parameters and algorithms has to be taken into\nconsideration when transposable elements regulation is investigated with sequencing datasets.\nResults: Here, we used simulated reads on the mouse and human genomes to define the best parameters for aligning\ntransposable element-derived reads on a reference genome. The efficiency of the most commonly used aligners was\ncompared and we further evaluated how transposable element representation should be estimated using available\nmethods. The mappability of the different transposon families in the mouse and the human genomes was calculated\ngiving an overview into their evolution.\nConclusions: Based on simulated data, we provided recommendations on the alignment and the quantification steps\nto be performed when transposon expression or regulation is studied, and identified the limits in detecting specific\nyoung transposon families of the mouse and human genomes. These principles may help the community to adopt\nstandard procedures and raise awareness of the difficulties encountered in the study of transposable elements.\nKeywords: Retrotransposon, High-throughput sequencing, Data analysis, Mapping, Quantification\nBackground\nTransposable elements (TEs) comprise approximately half of\nthe mammalian genomes [1]. Based on de novo repeat iden-\ntification, it has been suggested that two-thirds of the human\ngenome is in fact composed of repetitive elements [ 2].TEs\nare first classified according to their ability to invade the gen-\nome and their related molecular mechanisms. DNA transpo-\nsons use a cut-and-pastemechanism where the element is\nexcised and inserted into a new locus. Retrotransposons use\nan intermediate RNA template to insert into new genomic\nlocations, in a copy-and-pastemanner. These are classified\ninto Long-Terminal Repeat (LTR) elements that are similar\nto retroviruses, and non-LTR elements. Non-LTR elements\nare more abundant compared to LTR elements and DNA\ntransposons in mammalian genomes. The vast majority of\nTE insertions are incapable of mobilization, due to invalidat-\ning truncations, internal rearrangements or mutations. How-\never, based on cell culture assays, it has been estimated that\n80– 100 L1HS elements are competent for retrotransposition\nin the human genome [ 3] and around 3000 L1 elements\nfrom the Tf, A and Gf subfamilies are potentially capable of\nretrotransposition in the mouse genome [4]. De novo inser-\ntions of TEs -mainly Alu, L1 and SVA non-LTR families-\nhave been associated with mo re than 100 human diseases\n[5]. In reaction, cells have developed several restraining\nmechanisms against TE activity. At the transcriptional level,\nDNA methylation and repressive histone modifications block\nTE expression. In the cytoplasm, some restriction factors de-\ngrade retrotransposon RNAs. Other factors play a role in the\nnucleus by interfering with the DNA integration step [6].\nThe emergence of high-throughput sequencing tech-\nnologies has allowed making tremendous progress in\n© The Author(s). 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

However, the characterization of these\nelements remains computationally challenging, mainly\ndue to their repetitiveness [ 6]. As they are not unique in\nthe genome, repeated sequences create ambiguities in\nthe alignment step, which can lead to misleading\nbiological conclusions if inappropriate parameters are\napplied [ 7, 8]. Different algorithms have been developed\nfor the purpose of mapping reads according to the se-\nquencing application [ 9]. By default, most of these tools\nare parameterized to randomly report one genomic pos-\nition among the set of possible alignments. Additional\nparameters or filters are implemented to keep uniquely\nmapped reads, to report all possible positions of reads or\nto return up to a given number of valid alignments.\nBenchmarkings of these methods have also been re-\nported to compare their efficiency. Some of them inves-\ntigated specific biological applications, such as Whole-\nGenome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) [ 10] and RNA-\nseq [ 11] or specific sequencing platforms [ 12]. Schbath\net al. assessed the power of tools to retrieve all the read\noccurences. However, their study relied on simulated\nshort single-end reads of 40 bp without any insertions/\ndeletions (indels). Hatem et al. investigated the effect\nof different mapping parameters such as number of\nmismatches, seed and read length, gapped vs\nungapped alignment. Nevertheless, they did not inves-\ntigate the power of the different algorithms to align\nTE-derived reads.\nSome tools were developed to quantify TEs within se-\nquencing data. TEtools uses TE annotation to create Bow-\ntie2 index and performs mapping by reporting randomly\none position [ 13, 14]. RepEnrich recommends performing\nthe mapping with Bowtie to retrieve unique alignments\n[15, 16]. It enables quantifying unique reads emanating\nfrom specific families (referred to repEnrich Unique in this\nstudy) and the total number of reads, unique and multiple,\nmapped to each TE family ( repEnrich Total). The repEn-\nrich Fractional method counts reads that map to a single\nTE family and assigns multi-mapped reads to correspond-\ning families using a fractional value 1/ n,w h e r e n is the\nnumber of TE families the read maps to. SQuIRE [ 17]a l -\nlows quantifying TE single copies and families performing\nthe alignment with STAR [ 18] and using an iterative\nmethod to assign multi-mapped reads ( SQuIRE). Finally,\nTEtranscripts [19] advises to generate BAM files with the\nSTAR mapper, and performs TE quantification using only\nuniquely-mapped reads ( TEtranscripts Unique ), or using\nmulti-mapped reads with an iterative method ( TEtran-\nscripts Multiple).\nIn this study, we propose to benchmark at once the ef-\nficiency of the most used aligners and available tools for\nTE quantification. Using simulated data with mouse and\nhuman genomes, Bowtie, Bowtie2, STAR, Novoalign\n(http://www.novocraft.com), BWA aln [ 20] and mem\n[21] alignment algorithms were compared. We also\nassessed the effect of using paired-end library compared\nto single-end library with TE-derived reads. Reporting\nunique reads, randomly one position and all possible lo-\ncations were compared when TE abundance was esti-\nmated. In addition, TE quantification was compared to\nTE-simulated abundance using the most recent and used\nRepeatMasker-based tools, TEtools, repEnrich, SQuIRE\nand TEtranscript. Finally, the efficiency to map reads\nfrom each TE subfamily within the mouse and the hu-\nman genome was computed and revealed the difficulties\nof accessing specific young TE families.\nResults\nMapping based on STAR and PE libraries are highly\nrecommended to align reads coming from transposable\nelements\nTo compare different mappin g algorithms and their effi-\nciency to align reads from repeated sequences, we relied on\nsimulated data (Fig. 1a). Using a reference genome, 2x100bp\npaired-end reads were simulated with ART v2.5.8 [22]m i m -\nicking Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology (mean fragment\nsize = 200 bp, standard deviation = 20 bp and technology-\nspecific sequencing errors). Reads overlapping with Repeat-\nMasker annotations were kept (Smit, R, & P, 2013 – 2015).\nThree independent datasets were simulated at a 10X cover-\nage and aligned using Bowtie1, Bowtie2, BWA aln and mem\nalgorithms, Novoalign and STAR. Only one end of the simu-\nlated fragments (single-end (SE) alignment) or both ends\n(paired-end (PE) alignment) were used, allowing us to com-\npare the performance of both library types when TE-derived\nreads are aligned. Algorithms were run while enabling\nunique, randomly-reported or multi-mapped reads, except\nfor BWA algorithms that do not give the possibility to return\nseveral hits per read. Reported alignments were compared to\nthe simulated positions. When congruent, alignments were\nf l a g g e da st r u e - p o s i t i v e( T P )a n dw e i g h t e db yt h en u m b e ro f\nreported hits for the corresponding read in the multi-\nmapped mode. This approach allowed penalizing algorithms\nthat report too many positions per read.\nIn Fig. 1b, TP rate and percentage of mapping were\nrepresented using the chromosome 1 of the mouse gen-\nome as the reference genome for the data simulation\n(Additional file 1: Figure S1A for the chromosome 1 of\nthe human genome). In the top panel, uniquely-reported\nreads were considered. Around 92 and 95% of the reads\nwere aligned in the SE and PE libraries respectively,\nhighlighting the importance of using PE library to in-\ncrease the uniqueness of fragments derived from trans-\nposon sequences. Conversely, Bowtie1 is the only tool\nwhich does not capitalize on the PE library to improve\nthe mapping results. Some uniquely-mapped reads with\nSE library were not anymore mapped using paired-end\nTeissandier et al.

Post-mapping filtering is therefore required. In this\ncase, these mappers had the same performance with\nboth SE and PE libraries compared to STAR and Novoa-\nlign (Fig. 1b and Additional file 1: Figure S1A and Tables\n1 and 2).\nWhen randomly-reported and multi-mapped reads\nwere allowed (middle and bottom panels, Fig 1b and\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1A), the percentage of map-\nping increased close to 100%, leading to a decrease of\nTP rate around 93% for Bowtie1, 93% for the others in\nSE and 96% in PE. In addition, we also observed a big\ndrop in Bowtie2 TP rate in the multi-mapped mode.\nBowtie2 did not guarantee that the reported alignments\nare the best possible in terms of alignment score. Conse-\nquently, more alignments were reported, leading to a de-\ncrease of TP rate compared to other algorithms. As in\nunique mode, Bowtie1 was less efficient using PE library\nthan SE library compared to Novoalign and STAR.\nComputation time, BAM file size and memory usage\nwere finally reported (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 1cf o rm o u s e\nsimulation and Additional file 1: Figure S1B for the hu-\nman simulation) for all applied mappers and modes. The\nruntime measurement includes post-mapping filtering in\nthe unique mode for bowtie2, BWA mem and aln algo-\nrithms. All algorithms required less than 10GB, except\nSTAR which required 26GB at most. On the other hand,\nSTAR was at least 15 times faster compared to Novoalign.\nReporting all possible alignments per read increased at\nleast four times the output size in PE mode compared to\nrandomly-reported alignments for the mouse simulation.\nOutput size of Bowtie2 in multi-mapped mode confirmed\nthe fact that Bowtie2 reported too many alignments per\nread inducing a decrease of TP rate. In conclusion, STAR\ngave the best compromise in terms of mapping efficiency\nand accuracy, as well as computing time.\nQuantification of TE families: random and multiple\ncounting methods give the best estimations\nRegarding its better performance, STAR was used as the\nmapping algorithm in subsequent quantification analyses.\nOne library was simulated at a 10X coverage using the pipe-\nline described previously with the human and mouse ge-\nnomes as reference. The same mapping parameters than in\nprevious analyses were applied for the human simulation.\nHowever, mapping parameters were adjusted (see Additional\nfile 5) for the mouse simulation allowing higher number of\nmulti-mapped reads, to account for the more complex TE\ncontent in this species. TE-estimated quantification from dif-\nferent developed methods was compared to simulated abun-\ndance. TE families were quantified using uniquely-mapped\nreads (referred to FeatureCounts Unique alignments ),\nrandomly-reported position (FeatureCounts Random align-\nments) and all valid alignments ( FeatureCounts Multiple\nalignments). In the FeatureCounts Multiple alignments ,\nalignments were weighted by the number of corresponding\nhits. Quantifications were pe rformed using featureCounts\n[23]. In addition, repEnrich, TEtools, SQuIRE and TEtran-\nscripts were evaluated using recommended parameters. TE-\nsimulated abundance and estimated abundance were corre-\nlated for the different methods (Fig. 2af o rm o u s es i m u l a t i o n\nand Additional file3:F i g u r eS 2 Af o rh u m a ns i m u l a t i o n ) .\nMethods using only unique reads ( FeatureCounts\nUnique alignments, repEnrich Unique, TEtranscripts\nUnique) underestimated some TE families of all classes\n(LTR, LINEs and SINEs), with repEnrich Unique being\nthe least accurate. In contrast, counting the total number\nof reads mapping to each TE family -as it is the case\nwith repEnrich Total- induced an overestimation. On\nthe other hand, weighting by the number of hits ( Fea-\ntureCounts Multiple alignments ) or reporting randomly\none position ( TEtools and FeatureCounts Random align-\nments) gave the most satisfactory TE estimation with a\ncorrelation close to 1. To test whether coverage could\ninfluence these results, we repeated the simulation with\n5X, 10X, 25X, 50X and 100X coverage, focusing on spe-\ncific TE families known to be potentially active (B2_\nMm1a, IAPEz-int and L1MdA_I for the mouse genome\nand AluYa5, HERVK-int, L1HS and SVA_F for the hu-\nman genome). Independently of the coverage depth,\nmethods using unique reads ( FeatureCounts Unique\nalignments, repEnrich Unique, TEtranscripts Unique )\nconsistently underestimated TE families (Additional file\n3: Figure S3A and B), while FeatureCounts using random\nand multiple alignments and TEtools gave the best esti-\nmation, confirming the 10X genome-wide simulation.\nBy proposing to map reads on TE annotations only,\nTEtools contrasts with othe r mapping methods that align\nreads genome-wide and then extract TE-derived reads only.\nHowever, because transposable elements represent only half\nof the mammalian genomes, we wanted to estimate whether\nTEtools could introduce some biases. New datasets were\nthen simulated uniformly genome-wide, including non-\n(See figure on previous page.)\nFig. 1 Comparison of mapper efficiency with mouse simulated data.a A diagram showing the method for the data simulation.

Compared to\nthe FeatureCounts Random alignments (with STAR\nfor the mapping), TEtools clearly introduced an over-\nestimation of both LINE1 and LTR elements by for-\ncing non-derived reads to map to TE sequences\n(Fig. 2ba n dA d d i t i o n a lf i l e2:F i g u r eS 2 B ) .\nEvolutionarily young families suffer from low percentage\nof mapping and low true positive rate\nUsing PE library simulated on the mouse and human ge-\nnomes, we found that 89.8 and 93.4% of the reads were\nuniquely mapped, respectively, with a TP rate of 99.9%\n(Fig. 3a and Additional file 4: Figure S4A). However, we\nnoticed that some TE families displayed a lower map-\nping percentage. This was the case for the L1HS family\n– a recent human-specific L1 family- whereby 49% of\nsimulated reads had 88% of TP rate upon unique map-\nping. In the mouse genome, 25 families had less than\n50% of mapping when uniquely-reported reads were\nallowed, six of them being annotated in the LINE order.\nUsing estimated evolutionary age of mouse and human\nLINE1 families [ 24, 25], we found that the youngest fam-\nilies were the ones with the lowest percentage of\nTable 1 Statistics for the different mappers with mouse chromosome 1 simulation data\nAlgorithm Library Mode Mapping percentage True Positive rate Memory in gbytes Running Time in minutes Output size in Mbytes\nbowtie PE unique 91.87823 99.97913 0.92 3.00 583.36\nbowtie SE unique 92.05224 99.92287 0.69 1.33 311.38\nbowtie2 PE unique 94.57886 99.93802 1.28 38.00 572.58\nbowtie2 SE unique 92.08282 99.84845 1.18 32.67 294.64\nBwa aln PE unique 94.62602 99.88782 2.66 15.67 553.86\nBwa aln SE unique 96.60879 95.82612 1.85 3.00 310.30\nBwa mem PE unique 94.54763 99.95728 8.77 19.33 563.50\nBwa mem SE unique 92.08548 99.89624 8.40 4.67 299.76\nnovoalign PE unique 95.55760 99.61473 7.62 226.33 609.08\nnovoalign SE unique 92.08982 99.92307 7.61 31.67 315.96\nSTAR PE unique 95.37882 99.80753 16.67 2.00 553.24\nSTAR SE unique 92.23340 99.73004 16.18 2.33 285.06\nbowtie PE random 99.95300 93.67212 0.93 3.00 596.75\nbowtie SE random 99.99001 93.04126 0.69 2.33 317.67\nbowtie2 PE random 99.99991 95.89737 1.28 35.67 607.86\nbowtie2 SE random 99.98093 92.97406 1.18 25.67 324.26\nBwa aln PE random 99.99998 95.94218 2.66 17.67 604.39\nBwa aln SE random 99.99801 93.01531 1.85 4.00 322.33\nBwa mem PE random 99.99998 95.94068 9.42 18.33 612.39\nBwa mem SE random 99.99998 93.01096 7.96 6.33 329.82\nnovoalign PE random 99.99998 95.84899 7.62 272.00 616.78\nnovoalign SE random 99.99989 93.03697 7.61 30.67 322.72\nSTAR PE random 99.94380 95.93094 16.67 5.00 583.02\nSTAR SE random 99.99024 93.01921 16.26 2.00 314.19\nbowtie PE multi 99.95300 92.89719 0.98 18.33 7289.52\nbowtie SE multi 99.99001 93.01711 0.71 9.67 2747.64\nbowtie2 PE multi 99.99998 76.80653 11.53 28658.67 228148.51\nbowtie2 SE multi 99.99998 70.81391 8.74 8205.33 161697.48\nnovoalign PE multi 99.99998 95.85903 7.62 307.67 2627.41\nnovoalign SE multi 99.99989 93.03718 7.61 99.00 3176.37\nSTAR PE multi 99.94380 95.93265 23.95 7.00 2575.59\nSTAR SE multi 99.99024 93.02143 26.64 4.00 2831.57\nValues correspond to the average values of three independent simulated libraries with a 10X coverage.

The lower the age is, the lower mapp-\nability is as well.\nAmong the 25 mouse TE families with less than 50%\nof mapping, 19 were annotated as LTR retrotransposons,\nwith representatives of the three different classes of LTR\ndefined by their similarities to exogenous retroviruses\n[27]. In the ERV1 class, MURVY-int, its related LTR\n(RLTR5_MM) and RLTR4_MM (LTR flanking Murine\nLeukemia virus elements) had less than 25% of mapping.\nIn the ERVK class, reads corresponding to the IAPEz-int\nannotation had 28% of mapping. This annotation repre-\nsents the internal portion of IAPLTR1 elements, which\nare the young active elements from the IAP subtypes\n[28]. Finally, MERVL-int annotations, which represent\nactive members of the ERVL class, had only 30% of map-\nping [ 29].\nAs depicted in Fig. 1b and Additional file 1: Figure\nS1A, using PE library improved the mapping step by\nproducing a higher percentage of uniquely-mapped\nTable 2 Statistics for the different mappers with human chromosome 1 simulation data\nAlgorithm Library Mode Mapping percentage True Positive rate Memory in gbytes Running Time in minutes Output size in Mbytes\nbowtie PE unique 96.12725 99.99703 1.07 4.00 717.33\nbowtie SE unique 96.26772 99.98760 0.80 1.67 381.52\nbowtie2 PE unique 97.58530 99.99163 1.42 36.00 720.57\nbowtie2 SE unique 96.25897 99.93671 1.33 25.33 375.46\nBwa aln PE unique 97.58600 99.99135 3.01 13.67 703.84\nBwa aln SE unique 98.40958 98.52603 2.18 6.33 381.22\nBwa mem PE unique 97.57669 99.99745 5.65 8.33 715.38\nBwa mem SE unique 96.28285 99.98096 5.45 4.67 379.88\nnovoalign PE unique 97.83211 99.99187 8.31 99.67 745.17\nnovoalign SE unique 96.28793 99.98755 8.31 21.00 385.94\nSTAR PE unique 97.79129 99.99166 18.12 2.33 693.70\nSTAR SE unique 96.29801 99.96226 17.71 1.00 363.12\nbowtie PE random 99.95306 97.78786 1.07 4.00 722.46\nbowtie SE random 99.98993 97.48616 0.80 2.33 383.45\nbowtie2 PE random 99.99967 98.68378 1.42 47.00 738.73\nbowtie2 SE random 99.97064 97.42861 1.33 35.67 391.06\nBwa aln PE random 99.99998 98.68727 3.01 13.67 733.20\nBwa aln SE random 99.99814 97.47704 2.18 7.33 387.77\nBwa mem PE random 99.99998 98.69222 6.05 9.33 744.88\nBwa mem SE random 99.99998 97.47710 5.26 3.00 397.18\nnovoalign PE random 99.99998 98.68797 8.31 100.67 748.47\nnovoalign SE random 99.99998 97.48725 8.31 27.67 388.19\nSTAR PE random 99.94355 98.68767 18.12 3.33 709.61\nSTAR SE random 99.99103 97.47578 17.70 2.00 378.46\nbowtie PE multi 99.95306 97.41469 1.09 4.33 1032.87\nbowtie SE multi 99.98993 97.47888 0.82 2.00 540.64\nbowtie2 PE multi 99.99998 85.55682 11.92 71150.67 81772.06\nbowtie2 SE multi 99.99998 77.59895 6.34 62006.33 123387.84\nnovoalign PE multi 99.99998 98.68698 8.31 83.67 800.39\nnovoalign SE multi 99.99998 97.48601 8.31 24.00 572.07\nSTAR PE multi 99.94355 98.69066 18.12 4.00 754.66\nSTAR SE multi 99.99103 97.47921 17.64 2.00 541.40\nValues correspond to the average values of three independent simulated libraries with a 10X coverage.

These results demonstrate the importance\nof paired-end sequencing libraries, especially for the\nstudy of evolutionarily young TE families, provided that\nthey are not completely identical in sequence.\nDiscussion\nBecause of their repetitive nature, TE-derived sequences are\ncomplex to analyze. The objective of the present study was\nto provide objective guidelines for the analysis of transpos-\nable elements within high-throughput sequencing datasets.\nSample and library preparation\nAt the beginning of a project, experimental design and\nsample preparation should be conceived in order to re-\ntrieve as much information as possible. Chhangawala et al\n(2015) already showed that single-end reads increased the\nnumber of multi-mapped reads. In contrast, paired-end\nreads lower the amount of multi-mapped reads and in-\ncrease splicing event detection [ 32]. Our study confirms\nthe importance of using paired-end library instead of\nsingle-end when analyzing TE-derived reads, especially for\nevolutionarily young families such as SVA_F, AluYb9 and\nL1HS in the case of human-based analyses. Read length is\nanother parameter to take into consideration when TE-\nderived reads are sequenced. Chhangawala et al (2015)\nshowed that longer reads increased the uniqueness of se-\nquenced fragments. Longer fragment size should also help\nduring the mapping step, because the chance for the se-\nquenced fragment to fall into the boundaries or to cover a\npolymorphism will increase with the size of the fragment.\nAs a result, the mappability of the given fragment should\nincrease. However, having longer reads is a limitation of\nthe Illumina technology. It is also a limiting factor in some\napplications, such as ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN and WGBS,\nwhere fragment size is determined by obligate fragmenta-\ntion steps (sonication, micrococcal nuclease digestion or\nbisulfite-induced DNA degradation).\nMapping\nAfter quality control, read alignment against a reference gen-\nome is the first step in NGS analyses. Appropriate parame-\nters and algorithms are needed to align as many TE-derived\nreads as possible. BWA algorithms (mem and aln) and bow-\ntie2 have no defined paramet er for retrieving uniquely\nmapped reads. In such case, post-mapping filtering has to be\napplied. In contrast, Novoalign, bowtie and STAR have dedi-\ncated parameters to report uniquely-mapped reads. However,\nbowtie does not capitalize on the information of paired-end\nreads. If a 5 ’end read -R1 read- is uniquely mapped and the\ncorresponding 3’end read -R2 read- is a multi-mapper, bow-\ntie discards the valid alignment from the R1 read. In contrast,\nNovoalign and STAR use the information from the R1 read\nand increase the percentage of mapping with paired-end\nlibrary.\nIn the multiple-hit mode, Bowtie2 searches for up to k\nvalid alignments per read, where k is a threshold given\nby the user (k was set to 5000 in this study). In Bowtie2 ’s\nreference manual, it is mentioned: “Bowtie 2 does not\nguarantee that the k alignments reported are the best\npossible in terms of alignment score ” (http://bowtie-bio.\nsourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml). Other align-\nments with different alignment scores are reported in\naddition to the best alignment, which creates a low true\npositive rate and a bigger BAM file compared to STAR\nand Novoalign (Tables 1 and 2).\nWe found that reporting multi-mapped reads or reporting\nrandomly one position increases the percentage of mapping\nclose to 100% but at the cost of lower precision, which con-\nfirms previous results [ 11, 33]. Discarding multi-mapped\nreads is a real cost for evolutionary young families due to\nquasi-identical copies. However, these families are the ones\nthat are mostly regulated in th e genome, by repression his-\ntone marks and DNA methylation [ 34, 35]. As a conclusion,\nusing multi-mapped reads or reporting randomly one pos-\nition has to be done with caution to avoid discarding the\nmost important information of the TE fraction of the\ngenome.\nAs with the uniquely-mapped reads, STAR and Novoalign\nwere the best compromise to report multi-mapped reads or\na random valid alignment. However, Novoalign had a big dis-\nadvantage, its computing time, especially using PE reads.\nStarting with more than three millions of paired-end reads\nsimulated from the mouse chromosome 1, Novoalign ran-\ndomly aligned this set of reads in 4.5 h (Tables 1 and 2),\nwhile STAR completed the same task in 5 min. As the\namount of sequenced reads and the number of projects with\nsequencing data are growing, f ast algorithms are requested.\nT h i si sw h yw er e c o m m e n du s i n gS T A Rf o rt h em a p p i n g\nstep. Nevertheless, specific parameters have to be adapted for\nthe study of transposable elements. This is especially import-\nant for young families that display a low mappability score.\nUnadapted parameters can mask relevant results or on the\ncontrary, create incorrect conclusions. By default, STAR re-\np o r t su pt o1 0a l i g n m e n t sp e rr e a d .T h eE N C O D Ep r o j e c t\nrecommends to report up to 20 alignments per reads for\nlong RNA sequencing pipeline. These guidelines are adapted\nfor pseudogenes. In the case of TE studies and genomes with\nhigh TE content, these parameters have to be tuned (see\nMethods). A previous study based on ChIP-seq data esti-\nmated that a threshold of 10,000 positions per read is opti-\nmal in term of computing time and storage, without\nsignificant loss of sequence information (0.25% of reads elim-\ninated on average) [35].\nQuantification of transposable elements\nTo highlight TE regulation, transposable element quanti-\nfication is estimated and compared in different biological\nconditions. Dedicated methods have to be applied\nTeissandier et al. Mobile DNA           (2019) 10:52 Page 9 of 12\naccording to the parameters used during the alignment\nstep. We demonstrated that quantification methods rely-\ning on uniquely-mapped reads underestimated the abun-\ndance of the youngest TE families, because of their low\nlevel of sequence diversity and consequently, low map-\nping performance.\nWhen using reads with multiple hits, we found that\nreporting randomly one position or weighting multi-\nmapped reads with the number of hits give rise to the\nsame estimation. However, reporting multi-hits is more\nconsuming in terms of storage and time. In the case of\nmouse simulation, the output is five times bigger (500\nMbytes to 2500 Mbytes) when multi-hits are reported in\ncomparison to the random mode. The increase in the\nrate and amount of sequencing data represents a high\nstorage challenge for the community. Data analyses\nwithin TE studies has to be conducted with taking care\nof the amount of processed data. For this reason, we rec-\nommend to report randomly one position per read.\nWe also studied the specific case of TEtools , which\nquantifies TEs using randomly reported reads with Bow-\ntie or Bowtie2. However, this tool considers a list of TE\nsequences extracted from a genome or manually anno-\ntated- as genomic references for the mapping. We\nshowed that, in the case of available assembled genomes,\nperforming the mapping onto the reference genome\ngives rise to a better estimation of TE quantity in com-\nparison to the strategy applied by TEtools. Indeed, using\nonly a part of the genome assembly introduces a bias in\nthe alignment by forcing the mapping to this genome\nextract, the extent of which results from a combination\nof technology-specific sequencing errors and mismatch\nallowance in the alignment settings. Consequently, re-\ngions represented in this genome extract are overesti-\nmated. The method used by TEtools is analogous to a\nstrategy where TE consensus sequences provided by\nRepBase are used for the mapping step [ 36]. Aligning\nreads against consensus sequences should also lead to an\noverestimation of the abundance of TEs; it adds more-\nover another confounding factor by allowing more mis-\nmatches. In the case of available assembly genomes, we\ntherefore recommend to align reads with the reference\ngenome and extract expression with FeatureCounts.\nThen, for RNA-seq analyses, gene quantification can be\nperformed in the same time taking, advantage of only\none step. Gene and transposon-based differential expres-\nsion should be called in the same analysis, as it is done\nin SQuIRE and TEtranscripts.\nTransposable elements and their evolution\nHuman and mouse genomes are estimated to contain\n48.5 and 41.8% of TEs, respectively. Interestingly, using\ngenome-wide simulation on these species, we observed a\nhigher mappability in the human genome compared to\nthe mouse one. These differences likely reflect a more\nrecent activity of certain TE families in the mouse gen-\nome, and therefore a higher proportion of sequence\nhomology among TE copies. The overview we provide\nhere on the TE-specific mappability rate should help re-\nsearchers qualifying their conclusions made on specific\nfamilies. For instance, in the mouse, using uniquely-\nmapped reads on L1 young families, IAPEz and MERVL\nfamilies will undoubtedly induce an underestimation of\ntheir abundance in NGS datasets. We demonstrate and\nquantify here that significant improvement − 20 to 30%\nof mapping gain- can be obtained for these young TE\nfamilies by using PE library. This is truly important, par-\nticularly in RNA-seq datasets, as these families are the\nones that have more intact sequences, including at tran-\nscription factor binding sites, and therefore the potential\nfor being transcribed.\nConclusions\nBy comparing different available algorithms with simu-\nlated data generated onto the mouse and human ge-\nnomes, we demonstrated the difficulty of analyzing\nevolutionarily young TE families. Improvements can\nnonetheless be gained if the following recommendations\nare followed:\n1) paired-end library should be used to increase the\nuniqueness of sequenced fragments.\n2) During the alignment step, STAR is the best\ncompromise between efficiency and speed.\nParameters have to be set according to the TE\ncontent.\n3) Reporting randomly one position and using\nFeatureCounts to quantify TE families gives the\nbest estimation values.\n4) When TE annotation on an assembled genome is\navailable, mapping and quantification should be\ndone with the reference genome.\n5) Evolutionarily young families suffer from low\nmappability rate and are severely underestimated if\nuniquely-mapped reads are reported.\nMethods\nReconstruction of repeatMasker annotations\nTransposon annotations were downloaded from the\nRepeatMasker website (Smit, AFA, Hubley, R & Green,\nP.

As described in Bailly-Bechet et al.,\n2014, a dictionary was constructed for LTR retrotran-\nsposons that associated elements corresponding to the\ninternal sequence and those corresponding to LTR se-\nquences.
