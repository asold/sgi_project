Generally, oil is used inside the transformer for its opera tion\nand can release diﬀerent fault characteristic gases, such as hydrogen (H 2), carbon oxides (CO,\nCO2) and hydrocarbons (CH 4, C 2H2, C 2H4, and C 2H6). Hence, real-time detection of dissolved\ngases in transformer oil is very essential in order to avoid u nexpected failures ( Mariprasath and\nKirubakaran, 2018 ). At present, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) remains to be the si mplest and\nmost eﬀective diagnostic method for checking latent faults o f oil-immersed power transformers\n(Siada and Hmood, 2015; Fan et al., 2018 ). Therefore, using highly eﬃcient gas sensors to real-\ntime monitor these dissolved gases in transformer oil is a fe asible way to ensure the stability and\nreliability of power system ( Uddin et al., 2016 ).\nZhang et al. ZnO Based Gas Sensors\nDiﬀerent types of gas sensors have already been applied\nin the online detection of dissolved gases in transformer oi l,\nsuch as resistance-type ( Benounis et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2015 ),\noptical-type ( Ma et al., 2012 ) and electrochemical-type ( Ding\net al., 2014 ). Among diverse types of gas sensors, resistance-\nbased sensors stand out owing to advantages like the small,\ncheap, high sensitivity and low power consumption (\nBodzenta\net al., 2002; Yang et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2017; Xu et al.,\n2018\n). With the increasing demand for better gas sensors of\nhigher sensitivity and selectivity ( Sun et al., 2012; Gardon and\nGuilemany, 2013 ), countless endeavors have been poured on\nhunting for more suitable sensing nanomaterials. Semicond uctor\nmetal oxides (MOS), such as zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO 2),\ntungsten oxide (WO 3), etc., have received wide research for gas\nsensing applications and so on. Among these, the gas sensing\nperformance of ZnO-based gas sensor was ﬁrst investigated by\nSeiyama et al. (1962) . As a typical n-type semiconductor material\nwith a direct wide band gap (Eg ≈ 3.37 ev) and large excitation\nbinding energy ( ∼60 mev), ZnO has got important status in\nvarious MOS nanomaterials due to its high carrier mobility of\nconduction electrons, good chemical and thermal stability (\nZeng\net al., 2015; Das and Sarkar, 2017; Ganesh et al., 2017 ).\nThe gas sensing properties of ZnO greatly depend on\nits structure and morphology including surface area, size,\norientation and crystal density (\nCho et al., 2011 ). Therefore,\ntailoring the structure and morphology of ZnO is particularly\nimportant to optimize the gas sensing performances\n(\nLiao et al., 2008 ). In particular, the elaborate design of\nunique three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture s\ncan fully achieve this, since such hierarchical structures\npossess high surface area and fast gas diﬀusion as well as\nreduce the agglomerated conﬁguration of low dimensional\nstructures.\nZnO-based gas sensors commonly have the shortcomings of\nslow response, poor selectivity and lack of long-term stabili ty,\nwhich limits the wide applications. To acquire an eﬃcient and\nreliable dissolved gases sensor, high sensitivity, select ivity, long-\nterm stability, low response / recovery time, low fabricatio n\ncost are urgently needed (\nWang et al., 2012 ). This review\nfocuses on the factors that aﬀect the performances (sensitivi ty,\nselectivity and stability), the methods to improve these sen sor\nparameters and gas sensing mechanism of ZnO-based gas\nsensors.\nGAS SENSING PERFORMANCES OF\nZnO-BASED GAS SENSOR\nEffects of Morphologies About ZnO\nHierarchical Structures on Gas Sensing\nPerformances\nThree-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures are gener ally\nrecognized as the best candidate for gas sensing performance s,\ncompared with low-dimensional structures (\nMo et al., 2008;\nGuo, 2016 ). They are deﬁned as those assembled by zero-\ndimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimension al\n(2D) components, which can be further classiﬁed into the\nfollowing sub-sections. (1) Assembly of 0D structures: Li W. Q.\net al. (2015) reported the synthesis of pure ZnO hollow nanoﬁbers\nby electrospinning method. The walls of ZnO nanoﬁbers consist\nof the aggregation of many individual nanoparticles, as show n\nin Figure 1A. The sensor based on ZnO hollow nanoﬁbers\nexhibits excellent sensing performance for acetone detecti on,\nwhich can be attributed to the large aperture and small diamet ers\nprovide higher speciﬁc surface area for gas adsorption.\nChen\nH. et al. (2016) synthesized the uniformly monodispersed ZnO\nnanospheres via a simply hydrothermal route. In particular,\nall the microparticles on the surface are sphere-shapes and\nhave a rough surface, as shown in Figure 1B. This unique\nporous structure exhibits perfect sensing performance toward\nethanol. (2) Assembly of 1D structures:\nLin et al. (2015)\nreported the hierarchical ZnO microstructures by hydrother mal\nmethod. The morphology of the sample likes a bunch of\nﬂowers which is made of uniform nanorods, as shown in\nFigure 1C. The sensor based on the sample shows a good\nresponse.\nChen H. et al. (2016) reported the sea-urchin-like\nZnO nanostructures by hydrothermal method. The sample is\ncomposed of many strips and radiates from the center, as\nshown in Figure 1D. The sensor based on the ZnO sample\ntoward ethanol exhibits high sensitivity and quick response. (3)\nAssembly of 2D structures:\nGu et al. (2011) reported the porous\nﬂower-like ZnO nanostructures by economical hydrothermal\nsynthesis combined with subsequent calcination. Calcinat ion\nof the precursors produced ﬂower-like ZnO nanostructures\nwhich composed of interconnected porous ZnO nanosheets\nwith high porosity, as shown in Figure 1E. The as-prepared\nﬂower-like ZnO nanostructures are highly promising candidat e\nfor applications of gas sensors.\nHan et al. (2016) reported\nthe ZnO hollow spheres with high crystallinity via a simple\ntemplate process, as shown in Figure 1F. The surfaces of\nthese core-shell spheres are rough, suggesting that polystyre ne\nsphere (PSS) core was coated by ZnO nanoparticles. The\nsensor based on ZnO hollow spheres exhibits good sensing\nperformances.\nIn this part, the authors make a brief introduction with respec t\nto the hierarchical structures. Hierarchical hollow or porou s ZnO\nstructures exhibit excellent properties for gas sensor applicati ons\n(\nGuo et al., 2011, 2012, 2013 ). These unique hollow structures\nwith large speciﬁc surface area and highly porous structures\ncan provide excellent channel and “surface accessibility” f or\nthe gas transportation, which is very favorable for facilita ting\nthe interaction of ZnO surface with the gas molecules (\nGu\net al., 2011 ). No matter how complicated the hierarchical\nstructure, it’s all derived from low dimensional nanostruc tures\nas building blocks. Hence, the investigation about regulati ng\nthe structure and morphology is a meaningful and challenge\nwork.\nA summary about factors aﬀecting gas sensing performances\nof ZnO-based gas sensors and improvement approaches is shown\nin Table 1. The details are described in sections Factors aﬀecting\nthe sensitivity of ZnO hierarchical structure based Gas sen sor,\nFactors aﬀecting the selectivity of ZnO hierarchical struct ure\nbased Gas sensor, and Factors aﬀecting the long-term stabili ty of\nZnO hierarchical structure based Gas sensor as follows.\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 2 October 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 508\nZhang et al.

Given this, a\nnumber of strategies have been proposed for enhancing the gas\nsensitivity. It can be introduced from the following four aspe cts.\n• Modulation of the dimensional and the exposed crystal facet\nof their constituting building blocks.\nZhang et al. (2009) synthesized brush-like hierarchical ZnO\nnanostructures. The FESEM image ( Supplementary Figure 1A )\nshows that this structure is composed of 6-fold nanorod array s\nTABLE 1 | A summary about factors affecting gas sensing performances of ZnO\nhierarchical structure based gas sensors and improvement a pproaches.\nMain characteristic\nindexes which reﬂect\nthe performances\nInﬂuencing factors and\nimprovement approaches\nReferences\nSensitivity Modulation of the\ndimensional and the\nexposed crystal facet of\ntheir constituting building\nblocks\nZhang et al., 2009\nEnhance the porosity of\nhierarchical structures\nLei et al., 2017; Song\net al., 2018\nModiﬁcation by doping with\nnoble metals and loading\nother n-type or p-type MOS\nmaterials\nLin et al., 2015\nControl of grain size Mirzaei et al., 2018\nSelectivity Dope with noble metals and\np-type metal oxides\nLi T.

The central stem s\nprovide its six prismatic facets as growth platforms for branch ing\nof multipod units. The sensor based on these structures shows\nhigh sensitivity and fast response.\n• Enhance the porosity of hierarchical structures.\nLei et al. (2017) successfully synthesized hierarchical porous\nZnO microspheres assembled from 2D nanosheets. The high\nspeciﬁc surface area and hierarchical pore structure are bene ﬁcial\nto increase the adsorption capacity ( Supplementary Figure 1B ).\nSong et al. (2018) reported hierarchical porous ZnO microﬂowers\nwhich composed of ultrathin nanosheets. From the SEM image\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ), we can see that the surface of\nnanosheet has lots of pores. The porous structure is favorable\nfor gas sensor to promote the inward/outward gas diﬀusion and\nimprove gas sensitivity.\n• Modiﬁcation by doping with noble metals and loading other\nn-type or p-type MOS materials.\nIt’s known that noble metals, such as Pt (\nRout et al., 2006 ), Pd\n(Yang et al., 2010 ) and Au ( Vallejos et al., 2011 ) are frequently\nused in gas sensing materials due to doping can sensitize the\nZnO electronic and structural properties.\nLin et al. (2015)\nreported that Au nanoparticles were decorated on the surface\nof hierarchical ﬂower-like ZnO microstructures, as shown in\nSupplementary Figure 1D . After Au nanoparticle-decoration,\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 3 October 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 508\nZhang et al. ZnO Based Gas Sensors\nthe speciﬁc surface area is much higher than that of the\nbare ZnO ( Figure 1C). Au nanoparticles can act as catalysts\nto accelerate the chemisorption process and greatly improve\nthe sensitivity. So far, heterostructure composites consis ting of\ntwo metal oxides, such as (n-n type) SnO 2/ZnO (\nPark et al.,\n2013) and (n-p type) NiO/ZnO, AgO/ZnO ( Gandomania et al.,\n2014) have been successfully prepared and have improved the\nsensitivity. Liu et al. (2017) reported the NiO nanoparticles which\nwere decorated onto the surfaces of well-dispersed ZnO hollo w\nspheres ( Supplementary Figures 1E,F ). Such hollow structures\nwith rough surfaces endow the NiO/ ZnO composites high\nsurface areas and abundant active sites, which could facilit ate the\ngas diﬀusion toward the entire materials and an improvement of\nthe sensitivity (\nLee, 2009).\n• Control of grain size.\nPrevious research found that sensors which consist of ﬁne\nparticles of MOS tend to exhibit high sensitivity. Thus, one of\nthe most important factors aﬀecting the sensitivity is grain s ize\n(D) of the sensor materials in conjunction with the thicknes s of\nthe space charge layer (L). Supplementary Figure 1G illustrates\nthree kinds of schematic models for grain-size eﬀects (\nShimizu\nand Egashira, 1999 ). When D >> 2L, the conductance is limited\nby Schottky barrier at grain boundaries (grain boundary con trol).\nIf D ≥ 2L, the conductance is limited by necks between grains\n(neck control). When D < 2L, the conductance is controlled by\ngrains themselves (grain control). Among three models, grai n\ncontrol is the most sensitive condition ( Mirzaei et al., 2018 ). The\nsmaller the grain size, the higher the sensitivity of gas sen sor. But,\nexcessive decrease in grain size can reduce structural stab ility.\nFactors Affecting the Selectivity of ZnO\nHierarchical Structure Based Gas Sensor\nSelectivity is the ability of gas sensor to recognize the tar get\ngas in a mixture of other gases. Generally, there are two\napproaches for enhancing the selectivity of gas sensor. The\nﬁrst one is to synthesize a material which is selective to the\nspeciﬁc compound and has very low cross-sensitivity for other\ncompounds. Moreover, the synergistic eﬀect of two component\nsystem is greater than the production eﬀect of the two elements .\nIn fact, noble metals and p-type metal oxides have been\nextensively applied as good catalysts in the two component\nsystems to promote selectivity of sensors (\nLi T. M. et al., 2015 ).\nAnother approach to improve the selectivity is to combine\nwith other methods. Recently, some reports have suggested\nthat lowering the operating temperature can be realized by\nactivating the sensing material under UV illumination (\nHelwig\net al., 2009; Lu et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2015 ). The possible UV-\nactivated selective photo catalysis plays an important role in the\nenhancement of the selectivity at low temperature ( Li X. et al.,\n2015). It can be explained based on the selective photocatalytic\noxidation. The adsorbed oxygen would be re-activated by the\nphoton generated electron-hole pairs, which is conductive to\nenhancing their reactivity with target gas. After the targe t gas\nreacted with the adsorbed oxygen on ZnO surface, the donated\nelectrons would thus decrease resistance of the sensor and ﬁ nally\nreduce the operating temperature (\nHo et al., 2015 ). Chen et al.\nreported that the mesoporous hollow ZnO microspheres were\napplied to detect volatile organic vapors (VOCs) with the help\nof UV LED illumination at lower temperatures (\nChen Y. et al.,\n2016). The sensor with UV activation at 80 ◦C shows a much\nhigher response to ethanol ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). When\nthe sensor was operated at 220 ◦C, the UV illumination became\nineﬀective. It shows almost same response to ethanol and aceto ne\n(Supplementary Figure 2B ). This is because the diﬀerence about\ncatalytic conversion of O 2− would have negligible toward them at\n220◦C. However, the O − possibly indicated higher preference to\nethanol at 80 ◦C, resulting in the better selectivity. When metal\ndoped-ZnO was illuminated by UV light, the sensor had an\nappreciable selectivity at low temperature, which was attribu ted\nto the heterostructure was in favor of chemical interaction s,\nadsorption of gases and changes in electronic bind energies i n\nthe composite (\nChen et al., 2008 ). Espid investigated the photo-\nresponsive behavior of ZnO/ In 2O3 composite sensors ( Espid\nand Taghipour, 2017 ). When the semiconductor composites are\nirradiated with photons emitted from a UV source, the photo-\ngenerated electron/hole pairs will enhance the conductance o f the\nsensing layer and improve the selectivity.\nFactors Affecting the Long-Term Stability\nof ZnO Hierarchical Structure Based Gas\nSensor\nStability is a key parameter for the long-term development of g as\nsensors, which determines its application state in the real mar ket.\nGenerally, the long-term stability refers to the attenuati on degree\nof gas sensing performances (e.g., sensitivity, selectivity , response\nand recovery time) during a certain period of time. When the\nsensor is in working state, working conditions including hi gh\ntemperature and toxic gases can reduce the stability. When\nthe sensor is in normal storage state, changes of humidity,\nﬂuctuations of temperature in the surrounding atmosphere may\nalso interfere with the stability of sensor. At present, there is\nnot a recognized method to improve stability of ZnO-based gas\nsensors. Stability can be increased to some extent by calcin ation/\nannealing as the post-processing treatment (\nGu et al., 2011 ) and\nreducing the working temperature of gas sensing element. Chen\net al. tested the long-term stability of ZnO-based sensor wor king\nat 80 ◦C with UV activitation (\nChen Y. et al., 2016 ). The sensor\ntest lasted 1 month ( Supplementary Figure 2C ). In the ﬁrst 2\ndays, the response values dropped signiﬁcantly, which might\nbe related to the “pre-aging” eﬀect. In the next few days, the\nsensor response became stabilized and showed a good long-ter m\nstability. It might be because the microstructure of the mat erials\nhad little change under low temperature with low-powered UV\nactivation. In addition, doping noble metal or synthesis of mi xed\noxides can also increase the stability of the sensors (\nDey, 2018).\nGAS SENSING MECHANISM OF ZnO\nHIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE BASED GAS\nSENSOR\nBy summarizing the methods to improve the gas sensing\nperformances in section Gas Sensing Performances of ZnO-\nBased Gas Sensor, we ﬁnd that metal doping is an excellent\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 4 October 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 508\nZhang et al. ZnO Based Gas Sensors\nmethod to promote suﬃcient reaction between sensing materia l\nand target gas.\nThe gas sensing mechanism of noble metals doped-ZnO\nhierarchical structures based gas sensors is explained as an\nexample. This process mainly involves two eﬀects: chemical\neﬀect and electronic eﬀect (\nZhu and Zeng, 2017 ). Firstly,\nthe chemical eﬀect is related to spillover process ( Nakate\net al., 2016 ). Oxygen molecules were adsorbed on the surface\nand grain boundary of ZnO, forming the oxygen ions. The\nsensitization of noble metals increases the quantity of oxy gen\nspecies and accelerates the surface reaction, causing an expa nsion\nof charge depletion layer, which results in a higher baseline\nresistance ( Supplementary Figures 3A,B ). When the reducing\ngas is introduced, the catalysis of noble metals may give ris e to\nthe dissociation of target gas molecules. The trapped electro ns\nare released and transmitted to the conduction band, result ing in\na remarkable decrease in depletion layer with a lower resista nce.\nSecondly, the electric eﬀect is produced by contact resistance of\nnoble metal modiﬁed ZnO gas sensors (\nHosseini et al., 2015 ).\nElectrons from the conduction band of ZnO transfer into nobl e\nmetals owing to their work functions are diﬀerent, forming th e\nSchottky barriers at noble metal-ZnO interface, which lead ing\nto generate the additional depletion region near ZnO surface\n(Supplementary Figure 3C ).\nTherefore, the enhanced sensing performance was ascribed to\nthe spillover phenomenon, the formation of Schottky barriers at\nthe interface between noble metals and ZnO, more introduced\nsurface active sites and eﬀective surface areas (\nHosseini et al.,\n2015).\nCONCLUSION\nA study on gas sensing performances of ZnO hierarchical\nstructures has been shortly summarized in this review.\nFirstly, unique 3D hierarchical architectures with high se nsing\ncapabilities are discussed by modifying surface morphologie s.\nSmall grain size, high eﬀective speciﬁc surface area and porosi ty\nare favorable to the enhancement of gas sensing performances .\nTherefore, the preparation of the desired 3D hierarchical\nstructure can lay a solid foundation for the development of ga s\nsensor. Then, factors that aﬀect the sensitivity, selectivi ty and\nstability of ZnO hierarchical structures based gas sensors and\ntheir improvement strategies are summarized separately. Amo ng\nthese methods, additive doping and UV-light irradiation are\nmore eﬀective methods to improve gas sensing performances.\nThe former can increase charge carrier concentration and\ndecrease activation energy. The latter can promote the catal ytic\noxidation reaction between target gases and oxygen ions, thu s\nreduce the working temperature and power consumption.\nNumerous reports indicate that the integration of metal\ndoped-oxide and UV excitation is one of the most eﬀective\nand workable attempts to achieve high sensor performances.\nThe composite oxides based sensors under UV illumination\nhave better charge separation, which beneﬁt for the gas\nperformances enhancement of the sensors. We hope our\nwork is helpful for further exploration on higher gas sensing\nperformances of MOS sensing materials for detecting dissolve d\nfault gases in transformer oil. Finally, gas sensing mechani sm\nof noble metal sensitized ZnO is illuminated from the point\nof view of chemical eﬀect and electronic eﬀect. Nevertheless,\nthe authors suggest only a few possible ways to improve\nthe existed oxygen-absorbed model in recent researchers.\nMuch eﬀort should be made to hunt for an integration of\ndiﬀerent models which was used to explain the gas sensing\nreaction.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nHZ and W-GC conceived and designed the experiments, HZ and\nY-QL performed the experiments, HZ and Z-HS analyzed the\ndata, HZ wrote the manuscript with input from all authors.
