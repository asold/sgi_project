    "abstract": "The delayed settlement of foundations due to soil consolidation, creep or particle breakage can alter the internal load distribution and differential settlements in a superstructure through soil–structure interaction (SSI). The study introduces a novel methodology to simulate time-dependent SSI that overcomes the complexity of incorporating the time-dependent behaviour of foundations into routine SSI analysis. The proposed approach represents the superstructure as a condensed stiffness matrix, and replaces the foundations and underlying soils with macro-element foundation models that encapsulate the foundation–soil interaction into load–displacement relationships derived from constitutive models. To examine the performance of the proposed method, a macro-element model for time-dependent analysis of shallow foundations on sand was integrated with structural analysis to simulate two tests performed in a geotechnical centrifuge on a 3D-printed aluminium framed structure supported by footings on sand. The simulated responses of the superstructure and foundations were found to agree well with those observed in the centrifuge tests. Parametric analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of loading history, load level on the superstructure, and creep tendency of soil on post-construction load redistribution and differential settlements. The findings suggest that creep of foundations on sand facilitates load redistribution in the structure from heavily loaded sections to lightly loaded sections. Moreover, post-construction load redistribution depends on the differential creep between footings and should be considered for structures that are quickly constructed or at high levels of strength mobilisation (low factor of safety). Overall, the study highlights the potential of the proposed methodology in analysing the time-dependent SSI and its applicability in practical SSI analysis.",
