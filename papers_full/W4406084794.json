This would\nenhance the productivity of medical practitioners. The ChatGPT model has been\ndeveloped by OpenAI using the GPT [Generative Pretrained Transformer) framework, a\ndeep learning model that is utilized in natural language processing (NLP)] (1). The\nmodel can produce text that is like human writing and can interact with users via chat\nplatforms. With ChatGPT’s generative AI, original content can be generated in real-\ntime discussions ( 2, 3). A variety of arti ﬁcial intelligence models are employed to\nprovide conversational responses to inquiries based on extensive text data. ChatGPT is\ndesigned to remember both user input and its own responses within a conversation,\nallowing it to build upon previous responses as new inquiries are received (4). The\neffectiveness of ChatGPT has been considered in several healthcare domains, including\nits capacity to diagnose dental problems. It has been demonstrated that it provides\nTYPE Review\nPUBLISHED 06 January 2025\n| DOI 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 01 frontiersin.org\naccurate differential diagnoses in a substantial number of cases,\ncompared favorably with the diagnostic abilities of healthcare\nprofessionals (5).\nIn the realm of dentistry, research on ChatGPT’s effectiveness\nremains limited. There has been research on ChatGPT’s capability\nto produce scientiﬁc content within oral and maxillofacial surgery,\nas well as its accuracy and dependability in providing concise\nclinical responses in endodontics (6–8). In addition, its proﬁciency\nhas been assessed in various scenarios, including board-style\ndental knowledge quizzes, and answering questions related to\nscientiﬁc or research writing. Health care and dentistry will beneﬁt\ngreatly from the deployment of ChatGPT because it will increase\npatient autonomy, enhance the efﬁciency and safety of services,\nboost sustainability, and broaden the range and quality of care,\nultimately empowering patients (9). Artiﬁcial intelligence ﬁnds\nnumerous applications in prosthodontics, such as implant-\nsupported prosthetics, computer-aided design (CAD), maxillofacial\nprosthetics, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and bothﬁxed\nand removable prosthetics ( 10). Research on ChatGPT ’s\napplication within medical and dental disciplines lacks extensive\nsystematic reviews and meta-analyses. The utility of ChatGPT has\nbeen examined in numerous healthcare contexts including dental,\nHowever, these studies often have limited scope and fail to\nprovide insights into the potential bene ﬁts and drawbacks of\nintegrating ChatGPT into these ﬁelds., often consisting of only\nliterature reviews and editorials ( 11–13). It is anticipated that\nChatGPT will enhance the creation of precise and documentation,\nfacilitating collaboration and knowledge exchange among oral\nmedicine practitioners across clinics, hospitals, and departments\n(12). Oral medicine professionals can utilize ChatGPT ’st e x t -\ngeneration features to input patient data, clinical observations, and\ntreatment strategies, enabling them to create detailed reports. This\nnot only enhances the quality of documentation but also facilitates\neffective communication among healthcare providers. Moreover,\noral medicine specialists can utilize ChatGPT for virtual patient\ninteractions, offering advice, responding to inquiries, and\ndiscussing treatment options. It also assists in the decision-making\nprocess in cases involving complex oral medicine. The primary\nobjective of this review was to provide a detailed, evidence-based\nevaluation of ChatGPT’s potential as a resource for medical and\ndental research, with the goal of directing future investigations and\ninforming clinical practice.\n2 AI and data analysis in dentistry\nWithin the medical community, ChatGPT is gaining\nrecognition for its inﬂuence on both the healthcare system and\nmedical ﬁeld. It provides support as a complementary resource\nfor diagnosis and decision-making across a variety of medical\ndisciplines (14). Although the accuracy of its outputs and the\npotential for reinforcing biased diagnoses have prompted\ndiscussions on the necessity of human oversight when using this\ntechnology, ChatGPT can also be utilized in assessing disease\nrisks and outcomes, advancing drug development, enhancing\nbiomedical research, and transforming healthcare practice in\nsigniﬁcant ways ( 15–17). Arti ﬁcial intelligence has made\nremarkable progress in the ﬁeld of digital health, particularly in\ndentistry. In addition to diagnosing dental issues through the\nanalysis of imaging, it also aids in the planning of medical\noperations (18). The capabilities of artiﬁcial intelligence extend to\nthe analysis of auditory data to improve understanding of oral\nfunctions, thereby supporting dental education. The potential\napplications of AI in endodontics are demonstrated inFigure 1.\nAs evidenced by a bibliometric analysis showing an increase in\npublications on the subject from a single article in 2000 to 120 in\n2023, with a peak of 208 articles in 2022, AI’s applications within\ndentistry are on the rise ( 20). The use of neural networks in\ndiagnosing endodontic problems has been proven to be as\naccurate as that of dental professionals, offering bene ﬁts to\nnonspecialists and those new to the ﬁeld ( 21). Studies have\nshown the wide-ranging potential of arti ﬁcial intelligence in\nendodontics, emphasizing how it can enhance diagnostic\nprecision, treatment planning, and educational outcomes.\nFigure 2 illustrates how arti ﬁcial intelligence (AI) is\nrevolutionizing dental practice across different specialties. Visual\npatient simulators are used in dental education to enhance\ntraining experiences. With the help of virtual dental assistants\nand emergency teleassistance, patient management can be more\nefﬁcient and accessible. By using AI, dental radiologists can read\nand interpret radiographs more accurately, enhancing diagnostic\naccuracy. Surgical accuracy and outcomes are improved through\nthe use of AI in oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence is used in rapid CAD-CAM systems to\nstreamline dental prosthetic design and production. The use of\nAI in orthodontics allows for the analysis of radiographs, the\noptimization of tooth movement, and the planning of 3D aligner\ntreatments. Furthermore, forensic odontology employs AI for\ndetermining biological age and gender, analyzing bite marks, and\nassessing mandible morphology to assist with forensic\ninvestigations. AI is having a profound impact across a wide\nrange of dental specialties, improving both clinical outcomes and\npatient care. Mohan et al. ( 22) assert that despite concerns\nregarding patient privacy and potential misinterpretations, the\nintegration of AI-driven care systems in dentistry will improve\npatient care, encourage innovative research, and require\ncollaboration across various professional ﬁelds in the future.\nAdditionally, OpenAI ’s Generative Pre-Trained Transformer,\nGPT-4, represents an advancement in AI language technologies,\nimpacting dentistry and healthcare profoundly (23).\nMohamed M. Meghil et al. (24) present a systematic review\nadhering to PRISMA standards and the Cochrane Handbook,\nanalyzing the evolution and integration of artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) in various dental specialties. Their research encompasses 28\nstudies from distinct ﬁelds such as pathology, maxillofacial\nsurgery, and orthodontics, among others, sourced from PubMed\nand Web of Science. These studies were evaluated for\nmethodological quality and bias with the PROBAST tool,\nhighlighting AI’s role in clinical data analysis across dentistry.\nThe ﬁndings underline the substantial datasets available for\ntraining and testing, indicating AI ’s promise for improving\npatient outcomes, diagnostic processes, and treatment planning.\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 02 frontiersin.org\nHowever, the authors advocate for additional research, speciﬁcally\nrandomized clinical trials, to solidify AI’se fﬁcacy in dental practice,\naiming for data-driven, superior dental care that revolutionizes\ntreatment delivery. Thilagar et al. (25) explored the link between\nacute myocardial infarction (AMI) and periodontal disease (PD),\nfocusing on the shared systemic in ﬂammation indicated by\nC-reactive protein (CRP) levels. They emphasized the overlap in\nthe production of proin ﬂammatory and anti-in ﬂammatory\ncytokines, signaling molecules, and enzymes in both conditions,\nwhich contribute to their chronic in ﬂammatory nature. The\nFIGURE 1\nThe multifaceted effects of artiﬁcial intelligence on endodontic practice (19).\nFIGURE 2\nDiverse applications of AI in dental specialties, including dental education, patient management, radiology, surgery, prosthetic dentistry, orthodontics,\nand forensic odontology, by enhancing training, efﬁciency, accuracy, and patient care.\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 03 frontiersin.org\nstudy employed machine learning to identify key hub biomarker\ngenes involved in the interaction between AMI and PD.\nEggmann et al. (26) provided an overview of the implications of\nChatGPT and other LLMs for dental medicine. The article\nexplores these implications, noting that while ChatGPT is\neffective in language-related tasks, it has limitations like\nproducing incorrect content and misinformation. The direct\nimpact on dental practitioners is minimal, but LLMs could\ninﬂuence administrative tasks and telemedicine, offering beneﬁts\nsuch as clinical decision support and text summarization.\nThe review by (20) provides a historical overview of AI, from its\nconceptual inception in 1950 to its current applications in dentistry,\nwith particular attention on diagnostic imaging and computational\nchallenges. Marta Revilla-León et al. (27) conduct a systematic\nreview of AI applications in implant dentistry, speciﬁcally focusing\non design optimization, implant type identiﬁcation, and success\nprediction. The research suggests that AI has promising accuracy\nfor implant recognition and highlights areas for improvement,\nparticularly in success prediction models. Another study ( 28)\nexamines AI’s impact on dental imaging, showcasing its ability to\nimprove diagnostic accuracy, speed, and overall patient care.\nDespite advancements, more clinical trials are required to address\nlimitations in AI-based imaging. The research by (29) highlights\nthe gap in AI adoption in dentistry within low- and middle-\nincome countries, emphasizing a need for inclusive studies to\nexpand AI’s beneﬁts globally.\nThe evolution of language modeling has paved the way for\nsophisticated frameworks such as GPT, BERT, and ELMo.\nChatGPT, as an advanced Large Language Model (LLM),\ndemonstrates strong conversational abilities and potential for\ndental applications. The study by (23) explores the use of LLMs\nin dentistry, focusing on automated dental diagnosis and cross-\nmodal approaches. LLMs like ChatGPT are employed for text\nmining of medical records, natural language reasoning for\ntreatment planning, and NLP for medical documentation. Cross-\nmodal dental diagnosis leverages multimodal data, using visual\nand auditory information for enhanced diagnostics. The research\nalso addresses the challenges of incorporating LLMs in dentistry,\nsuch as data quality, model bias, privacy concerns, and\ncomputational limitations. It suggests human oversight to correct\npotential inaccuracies, emphasizes neural-symbolic models to\nmitigate bias, and underscores strict data privacy protocols to\nenhance AI adoption in dental practice.\nChatGPT, a member of OpenAI’sG P T( G e n e r a t i v eP r e - t r a i n e d\nTransformer) family, is based on transformer architecture, which is\nkey to its deep learning capabilities. The model ranges from 12 to 96\ntransformer layers with multiple attention heads per layer, allowing\nit to focus on different parts of the input sequence. Embedding\ndimensions range from 768 to 12,288 depending on the model\nscale, contributing to the richness of text representations. GPT-3,\nfor example, contains 175 billion parameters, enabling it to\ngenerate coherent and contextually relevant text. ChatGPT is\ntrained using a mix of publicly available text and licensed datasets,\ninitially with unsupervised learning, followed by ﬁne-tuning for\nhuman-like responses (30). The latest iteration, GPT-4, introduces\nsigniﬁcant advances in the medicalﬁeld, including tools such as\nan Advanced Image Generator, Code Interpreter for data\nprocessing, and a Browser Tool for accessing up-to-date\ninformation. It also integrates DALL·E for generating visuals and a\nText-to-Speech tool for spoken output. These features make GPT-\n4 a powerful assistant for healthcare professionals, enabling tasks\nlike dental diagnostics and patient education (31, 32). To enhance\ndata management and improve diagnostic precision in dentistry,\nChatGPT can be integrated with Electronic Dental Records\n(EDRs). Patel et al. (33) examined EDRs for classifying patients’\nsmoking status using machine learning classi ﬁers, ﬁnding that\nsupport vector machines were most effective. This demonstrates\nhow EDRs can provide detailed patient insights, which is often\noverlooked in traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs).\nThe use of EDRs is limited to secondary purposes, such as\nconducting research or analyzing treatment outcomes. In addition\n(34), discusses both the challenges and opportunities associated\nwith leveraging EDRs for dental research. There is a prevalent use\nof unstructured text in EDRs, which makes their use in research or\noutcome analysis difﬁcult. While NLP techniques are acknowledged\nfor their ability to extract detailed information from clinical notes\nin EDRs, the paper highlights obstacles to their widespread\nadoption. Among these challenges are the lack of applications of\nNLP in primary oral healthcare, the dif ﬁculty of generalizing\nﬁndings due to dentistry’s unique vocabularies, and the difﬁculties\nassociated with cross-referencing results and validating them. An\noverview of ChatGPT and EDRs is shown inTable 1.\nThe study (44) explored ChatGPT’sp r oﬁciency in answering\nfrequently asked questions (FAQs) regardingﬂuoride based on the\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA) guidelines. Using structured\nmethodology, ChatGPT was asked a series of eight speciﬁc ﬂuoride-\nrelated questions on two separate occasions, May 8th and May 16th,\n2023. The recorded responses from ChatGPT were compared with\nthose from the ADA’sw e b s i t e .C h a t G P T’sr e s p o n s e sa n dt h o s e\nprovided by the American Dental Association were analyzed\nprimarily qualitatively to identifysimilarities in wording and context.\nIn this assessment, ChatGPT’s answers were compared with the\nofﬁcial ADA answers to assess their consistency over the week-long\nperiod. While ChatGPT’s responses were consistent over time, they\nwere more detailed and scientiﬁc than those of the ADA, even\nthough both fundamentally conveyed the same information about\nt h er o l eo fﬂuoride in dental health. In addition to radical dental\ninformation dissemination, these studies present promising\napplications in radiology for more efﬁcient and accurate medical\nimage diagnoses, which could result in improved patient care and\nlower healthcare costs. AI technology in clinical applications has\nsigniﬁcantly enhanced patient outcomes, streamlined processes, and\nreduced costs. In dentistry, convolutional neural networks have\ndemonstrated improved accuracy in identifying and classifying\nmaxillofacial fractures, highlighting AI’s transformative potential in\ndental diagnostics. Notably, ChatGPT’s accuracy in various dental\nand surgical domains, including oral and maxillofacial surgery, has\nbeen studied (10\n, 45).\nFor example, GPT-3 was found to accurately identify\nanatomical points in oral radiography with 100% accuracy,\nthough Mago et al. (35) cautioned against relying solely on it\ndue to occasional inaccuracies. Similarly, Vaira et al. ( 46)\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 04 frontiersin.org\nconducted a study in August 2023 to evaluate ChatGPT’s accuracy\nin head and neck oral maxillofacial surgery,ﬁnding that 87.2% of\nthe responses were accurate and 73% were comprehensive.\nDespite these promising results, researchers noted that ChatGPT\nis not fully reliable for decision-making in complex surgical\ncases. In prosthodontics, it is crucial to assess the accuracy and\nconsistency of ChatGPT. Such an assessment involves comparing\nChatGPT’s responses to established knowledge and guidelines in\nprosthodontics. Consistency is measured by checking if the AI\nprovides similar answers to repeated or rephrased questions.\nCurrently, there is a lack of literature on the application of\nChatGPT in interceptive orthodontics.\nIn the following Figure 3 outlines the ﬂowchart for assessing\nChatGPT’s accuracy and consistency in responses related to\nRemovable Dental Prostheses (RDPs) and Fixed Dental Prostheses\n(FDPs). The process starts with formulating questions about these\ndental topics and analyzing ChatGPT’s responses.\nThe questions are then entered into the ChatGPT interface,\nwhich begins the process of generating GPT answers. A\nprosthodontic specialist grades the responses obtained from\nChatGPT based on their accuracy and relevance (47, 48). As a\nﬁnal step in the methodology, the graded answers are statistically\nanalyzed to determine both the accuracy of the ChatGPT answer\nand the repeatability of the answers across multiple interactions.\nIn the ﬁeld of orthodontics, Subramanian et al. (49)d e m o n s t r a t e\nAI’s potential to simplify cephalometric tracing for everyday\nclinical use and to conduct extensive data analysis for research. In\na study by Tanaka et al. ( 50), they found that ChatGPT was\neffective in delivering informative responses on topics related to\northodontics, such as digital imaging, clear aligners, and\ntemporary anchorage devices. Tanaka et al.’s study is similar to\nthe current study but differs in those ten orthodontists with\nspecialized training from various Italian orthodontic schools\nevaluated the patients instead ofﬁve general orthodontists as in\nTanaka et al.’s study. Duran et al. (51) acknowledge that while\nChatGPT can provide reliable information on cleft lip and palate,\nits complex responses need professional veriﬁcation. The AI tool,\naware of its limitations, advises consulting a specialist for\northodontic decisions. Despite its usefulness, ChatGPT cannot\nreplace the essential in-person aspects of dental care. However, it\ncould streamline administrative tasks in dental practices, such as\nmanaging insurance claims and supporting dental telemedicine.\nGonzales et al. (52) suggest that AI can match expert human\nobservers in determining cervical vertebral maturity stages,\nTABLE 1 An overview of ChatGPT and electronic dental records (EDRs).\nResearchers Techniques Data quantity LLM\ncategories\nInquiry\ntechnique\nEvaluation criteria\nMago and Sharma\n(35)\nInterrogating an LLM about\nimaging features, oral\nanatomy, and disease\nSet of 80 queries Conversational\nModel GPT-3\nUnprompted 4-tier modi ﬁed preference scale\nChuang et al.

The authors of this study hold a different\nview, noting that the orthodontists involved did not ﬁnd the\nChatGPT responses completely accurate. For both open-ended and\nclinical case questions, accuracy scored 4.9 out of 6, while\ncompleteness scored 54.3%. Furthermore, Ahmed et al. (53)h a v e\nshown that AI can develop precise caries detection models, aiding\nclinical decision-making, and improving patient care. AI has not\nyet substantially improved the ability to provide answers to open-\nended questions, diagnoses, or treatment planning for clinical\ncases, despite x-ray analysis being a static process.\n3 AI-based systems developed and\nmedical training\nAI in healthcare is often developed by computer scientists\nwithout medical training, leading to a focus on technical\nproblem-solving rather than the holistic care provided by\nclinicians ( 54). Despite AI ’s advantages in dentistry, such as\nimproving speed, accuracy, and standardization, adoption is slow\namong dental professionals due to steep learning curves, high\ncosts, and extensive data requirements (55). While AI has proven\nuseful in ﬁelds like medical imaging, such as identifying COVID-\n19 from CT scans (56), its clinical applicability in dental practice\nremains limited. The transition from perceiving AI as a threat to\nembracing it as a tool re ﬂects its growing in ﬂuence across\nhealthcare (57–59). However, over-reliance on AI for diagnosis\nand treatment is discouraged, and dental professionals are urged\nto maintain oversight.\nChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI, offers\nhuman-like text responses through ML and DL, enhancing\ncomputer communication and responsiveness. Its potential\napplications span education and patient care, particularly in\nproviding information and managing expectations for pre- and\npost-surgical dental patients. ChatGPT can contribute to patient\neducation, empowerment, decision-making, and service efﬁciency\nin dentistry. Lee et al. (60) discuss how large language models like\nChatGPT can enhance medical education by providing interactive\nsimulations and acting as virtual teaching assistants. While these\nmodels could improve student engagement, Jamal (61) emphasizes\nthe need for more research to verify these beneﬁts and highlights\nthe importance of adapting curricula to keep pace with AI\nadvancements. A framework for incorporating ChatGPT into\nmedical education is also proposed, emphasizing both immediate\nenhancements in digital literacy and long-term strategies focusing\non patient-centered care. In a study assessing ChatGPT ’s\neffectiveness, responses to 284 questions generated by 33 doctors\nacross 17 specialties were found to be accurate and complete,\nindicating its potential as a reliable medical knowledge source\n(62). However, variability in performance suggests room for\nimprovement. Another study (63) revealed that recent medical\ngraduates are cautiously optimistic about using AI in their\neducation and careers, with positive attitudes linked to prior AI\nexperience. This underscores the need for formal AI education to\nprepare students for an AI-integrated healthcare environment.\nWhile ChatGPT and AI hold promise for transforming dental\npractice and education, challenges such as variability in\nperformance, ethical concerns, and the need for clinician oversight\nremain critical to their effective implementation (64).\nFIGURE 3\nThe approach employed to assess the accuracy and consistency of responses generated by ChatGPT to questions regarding RDPs and tooth\nsupported FDPs.\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 06 frontiersin.org\nIt is important to note that ChatGPT, like any other emerging\ntechnology, has its limitations. The system is operated by a vast\nneural network that is extremely computationally intensive and\nconsumes a large amount of memory, making it prohibitively\nexpensive for smaller medical practices with limited budgets (65).\nThe model’s inability to incorporate external data sources can\nnegatively affect its accuracy, which is a critical factor in the\nmedical ﬁeld. Further, ChatGPT sometimes fails to cite references\ncorrectly or at all, and its responses may differ based on the\ncontext of the conversation, leading to convincingly incorrect\nresponses (65–68). It is for these reasons that ChatGPT must\nproperly express uncertainty to avoid misdirection. The advent of\nartiﬁcial intelligence technologies in dentistry, referred to as\n“Dentronics,” heralds a new phase of transformation with\npotential beneﬁts, including improved reliability, reproducibility,\nprecision, and efﬁciency. Additionally, Dentronics could enhance\nthe understanding of disease mechanisms, risk assessments,\ndiagnostic processes, and prognoses to improve patient outcomes\n(68). The integration of AI into dentistry continues to grow,\nhowever, it is unlikely to completely replace dentists, since the\nprofession demands more than just disease diagnosis. It also\ninvolves integrating clinical observations and providing patient\ncare. In spite of this, dental professionals would bene ﬁt from\ngaining a solid understanding of AI principles and\nmethodologies as theirﬁeld continues to evolve (69, 70).\n4 AI in dental pathology, clinical\npractice, and surgery\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has signi ﬁcantly transformed the\nmedical and scientiﬁc landscapes, including its integration into\nvarious aspects of diagnosis, therapy, and patient care (71). The\neffectiveness of AI chatbots in providing accurate and trustworthy\ninformation is crucial for adoption in clinical decision-making.\nThese tools facilitate discussions that may enhance diagnostic and\ntreatment guidelines, particularly in dentistry. For instance, AI can\nhelp identify pathologies in the maxillary sinuses that may not be\napparent in extraoral radiographs, thus reducing diagnostic errors\nfor less experienced dentists. Kim et al. (72) demonstrated that AI\ncan provide superior sensitivity and speci ﬁcity compared to\nradiologists when analyzing Water’s view radiographs. AI has also\neffectively identiﬁed conditions such as mucosal hypertrophy and\nretention cysts, which are sometimes overlooked by radiologists.\nKuwana et al. ( 73) proposed a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) model to distinguish such conditions in CBCT images,\nhighlighting AI’s potential in improving diagnostic accuracy.\nIn oral cancer detection, early diagnosis is vital since it ranks as\nthe sixth most prevalent cancer. Nayak et al. (74)d e m o n s t r a t e d\nthat AI using laser-induced auto ﬂuorescence spectra could\naccurately distinguish between normal, premalignant, and malignant\ntissues, suggesting its potential for real-time clinical use. AI ’s\ncapabilities in predicting cancer recurrence and assessing lymph\nnode involvement further improve patient care by offering accurate\nscreening tools and personalized treatment approaches. ChatGPT,\nin particular, has shown promise in recognizing oral and\nmaxillofacial disorders. Its ability to process large volumes of\npatient information can aid dental practitioners in diagnosis and\ntreatment planning (75). With advancements such as GPT-4, which\nc a ni n t e r p r e ti n f o r m a t i o nf r o mi m a g e s ,C h a t G P Te n h a n c e s\ndiagnostic accuracy and assists in treatment guidance. However,\nwhile ChatGPT can provide timely and accurate information, it\nshould not replace professional consultations, and further clinical\nvalidation is necessary.\nTABLE 2 Integration and applications of digital dentistry in modern dental practices.\nTime\nPeriod\nApplication Field Critical technologies\nPast Digitized dental impressions Dental reconstructions Computer-aided design/manufacturing, Intra-oral digital scanning\nPast Assisted computer navigation for dental\nimplants\nImplantology Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), computer-aided Design/\nmnufacturing\nPresent Three-dimensional dental replicas Prosthetic dentistry, Orthodontic treatment Three-dimensional fabrication, computer-aided design /manufacturing\nPresent Machine learning detection of tooth decay Diagnostic Procedures Machine learning, digital image processing\nPresent Virtual reality for dental education Educational tools for patients Virtual reality, Three-dimensional visualization\nFuture Machine intelligence for treatment strategizing Orthodontic planning, Maxillofacial surgery Machine intelligence, digital image interpretation\nFuture Biocompatible dental components produced\nby additive manufacturing\nDental implantology Additive manufacturing, Computer-Aided Design/Manufacturing,\nBioengineering materials\nFuture Remote dental consultations via digital\ncommunication\nRemote dental care Telecommunication, Digital communication platforms, diagnostic\nimaging technology\nFuture Tailored dental prosthodontics Prosthodontics Digital dental mapping, Computer-Aided Design/Manufacturing,\nThree-dimensional fabrication\nFuture Utilization of advanced language models in\ndentistry\nDental diagnosis automation and\nmultimodal diagnostic evaluation\nAdvanced linguistic computational models, speciﬁcally ChatGPT\nFuture Customized conversational assistance Patient Consultation Conversational AI, Chatbot technology\nFuture/\npresent\nPreparing prospective dental professionals Dental undergraduate education Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR)\nPresent Advancement and evaluation of color\nmatching in dental restorations\nDental restoration color matching Traditional methods versus spectrophotometric benchmarking\nPresent Transition to digital radiography Routine dental operations Enhancement of image luminance and contrast, specialized image\nprocessing algorithms, sensor-agnostic technologies\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 07 frontiersin.org\nA systematic review ( 76) highlighted ChatGPT ’s role in\nsupporting diagnostic pathology. Despite challenges like the\nquality of training data and occurrences of“hallucinations,” the\nstudy noted ChatGPT’s utility in providing extensive scienti ﬁc\ninformation. However, it underscored AI’s role as a supportive\ntool rather than a decision-maker. Concerns regarding the\naccuracy of AI-generated scientiﬁc references were highlighted in\nanother study (77), which showed ChatGPT’s low accuracy rate\nin generating reliable bibliographic information, emphasizing the\nneed for integrating credible scientiﬁc databases. ChatGPT also\nhas potential in dental research, as explored in a review ( 78),\nwhich showcased how its transformer-based architecture\nfacilitates the efﬁcient synthesis of data for systematic reviews.\nWhile the model streamlines research activities, it also presents\nchallenges, such as limitations in understanding speciﬁc dental\nissues and potential biases in training datasets. The review\nemphasized the importance of integrating AI with human\nexpertise to enhance research quality and outcomes.\nIn a study (21) conducted in Japan, deep learning was employed\nto detect fatty degeneration in salivary gland parenchyma, indicating\nSjogren’s syndrome. The study utilized 500 CT scans, with 400 for\ntraining and 100 for testing. The diagnostic performance of the\nDL system was on par with experienced radiologists and surpassed\nthat of less experienced counterparts. As shown inTable 2,t h e\nfollowings are instances of the integration and application of\ndigital dentistry in today’s dental practices. Diagnosing salivary\ngland tumors is challenging due to their infrequent incidence and\nmorphological similarities. Machine learning has been employed to\ndiscern malignant salivary gland tumors based on their cytological\nfeatures. In a study by Chiesa-Estomba and colleagues ( 43), a\ncomprehensive approach integrating clinical, radiological,\nhistological, and cytological data was utilized to anticipate facial\nnerve dysfunction in patients undergoing surgical treatment for\nsalivary gland tumors with potential posterior nerve injury.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence stands as a valuable diagnostic tool, offering\nthe capability to predict facial nerve injury and providing proactive\nawareness for surgeons and patients about potential complications.\nThe incorporation of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), particularly\nChatGPT, into clinical dental practice and surgery represents a\nparadigm shift, promising to enhance diagnostic capabilities,\nimprove surgical precision, and revolutionize patient care. In a\nstudy ( 79), researchers evaluated ChatGPT ’s utility in dental\neducation and its potential as a clinical decision support system.\nThe study gathered insights from 27 specialists in nine dentalﬁelds\nand assessed ChatGPT’s responses to 243 dental questions. Oral\nmedicine and radiology received the highest ratings, indicating a\ngeneral precision in ChatGPT’s answers. However, the study also\nemphasized the importance of human oversight, cautioning against\nreplacing professional consultations with AI. Another study (80)\ndiscussed ChatGPT’s role in surgical training, speci ﬁcally in\notolaryngology, emphasizing its value for educational purposes\nduring periods of reduced clinical exposure, such as the COVID-19\npandemic. The authors highlighted ChatGPT’s ability to enhance\nlearning by simulating patient communication and providing\ntailored responses. A study ( 81)c o m p a r e dC h a t G P T’s\nrecommendations for laryngology and head and neck surgery cases\nwith those of board-certiﬁed otolaryngologists. While ChatGPT\naccurately provided primary diagnoses and treatment options, it\ntended to suggest more tests than necessary, highlighting its\npotential as a supplementary diagnostic resource.\nThorat et al. ( 82) explored the impact of ChatGPT on\nundergraduate dental education, particularly focusing on its ability\nto support personalized learning, evidence-based assessment, and\nintegration into virtual simulations. ChatGPT was recognized for\nenhancing learning diversity and offering multilingual support,\nmaking it a valuable tool for modern dental education. According\nto Saravanan’s study ( 83), the use of ChatGPT in oral and\nmaxillofacial surgery was evaluated in terms of its impact on\npatient care, surgical precision, and integration into traditional\npractices. The study emphasized the potential beneﬁts of ChatGPT\nin enhancing patient communication, improving surgical outcomes,\nand supporting education, while also highlighting the need for a\nbalanced approach between AI and traditional methods. The\nintegration of ChatGPT into dental practice also includes\nenhancing communication between patients and healthcare\nproviders. Figure 4 illustrates the work ﬂow for processing\nCone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) data and presenting\nit to patients. Within this work ﬂow, ChatGPT can enhance\npatient comprehension by automating the generation of\ninterpretive reports, distilling complex diagnostic data into\naccessible summaries, and translating technical jargon into clear\nlanguage— ultimately empowering patients to better understand\ntheir scan results.\nThe ChatGPT application can also provide personalized\nexplanations of the treatment implications based on the\ndiagnostic conclusions, thus bridging the gap between technical\nmedical ﬁndings and patient education. As a result, patients are\nmore informed and engaged, which is crucial for successful\nhealthcare outcomes. A study conducted by Shan et al. ( 84)\nunderscores that AI serves as a complementary tool for dental\nprofessionals rather than a substitute. It also emphasizes the\ncurrent advantages of AI in improving diagnostic accuracy,\naiding in treatment planning, and predicting outcomes.\nMoreover, they mention the challenges associated with AI ’s\nbroader adoption, such as data management, algorithm\ntransparency, computational demands, and ethical implications.\nThe authors suggest a collaborative approach to integrate AI into\ndentistry, suggesting that AI can improve ef ﬁciency and\noutcomes, but cautioning that challenges such as methodological\nlimitations, data scarcity, and ethical concerns must be addressed,\nwith human oversight and evidence-based practices being crucial\nto maintaining trust in AI applications in dentistry. The review\nby (85) also highlights the signi ﬁcance of ‘explainable AI’ to\ndemystify AI processes for users and the necessity of updating\ndental education to include digital proﬁciency to keep up with\nthe pace of technological advancement. Li et al. ( 86) discuss\nGPT-4’s potential in neurosurgery, including its contribution to\nbrain-computer interfaces and understanding neural behaviors,\noffering insights into therapeutic approaches for neurological\nconditions. Figure 5 in the study, illustrates the progression from\nearly expert systems to contemporary AI in software\ndevelopment, emphasizing their use in clinical dental practice\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 08 frontiersin.org\nand surgery. Traditional intelligence follows a linear path from\nperception to interpretation and then to response, mirroring\nhuman cognitive function. “Software 1.0” represents early expert\nsystems that mimic human cognition by applying predeﬁned data\nand rules through explicit programming, but these systems\nrequire human interpretation of their outputs. “Software 2.0”,\nencompassing machine learning and deep learning, represents a\nmore advanced phase of AI where systems learn from data\noutcomes. In machine learning, experts design features to guide\nalgorithms, which are then mapped to outputs (87).\nDeep learning automates the learning process from raw data,\nenabling more complex data processing and outputs that mimic\nFIGURE 5\nAn illustration of the evolution of artiﬁcial intelligence from software 1.0, which consisted of expert systems that used explicit programming to interpret\nuser input, to software 2.0, which incorporates advanced methods such as machine learning and deep learning.\nFIGURE 4\nWorkﬂow for processing and segmenting CBCT data for patient presentation.\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 09 frontiersin.org\nautonomous human responses. The rapid growth of AI in\nhealthcare, fueled by advancements in computational power and\ndata availability ( 88), is particularly evident in oral and\nmaxillofacial surgery (OMFS), where convolutional neural\nnetworks are increasingly used for image-based diagnostics.\nAI applications in dentistry are transforming diagnosis and\ntreatment, offering unprecedented precision, ef ﬁciency, and\npersonalized care. He et al. (89) discuss the utility of ChatGPT\nand GPT-4 in healthcare, highlighting their potential beneﬁts for\nsurgical planning and patient communication, but caution that\nthese tools should be used under supervision due to their lack of\nnuanced clinical expertise. While GPT-4 can handle large\ndatasets and act as a virtual assistant across medical disciplines,\nit remains supplementary to a physician’s judgment. Balel et al.\n(90) recognize ChatGPT ’s usefulness in disseminating patient\ninformation within oral and maxillofacial surgery, recommending\nits integration into clinical practice with caution. Ferres et al.\n(91) further suggest ChatGPT ’s ability to amalgamate diverse\ndata types could enhance radiology by combining images, text,\nand patient records for tasks like report generation.\nHiroj Bagde et al. (92) conducted a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis to evaluate ChatGPT’s accuracy in medical and dentalﬁelds.\nAlthough ChatGPT’s accuracy ranged from 18.3% to 100% across\ndifferent studies, it generally performed better than chance,\nsuggesting its potential as a research tool in dentistry and\nmedicine. However, caution is advised, and further research is\nneeded to enhance its dependability. Another study (45) evaluated\nChatGPT-4’s responses to 30 oral surgery-related questions,\nﬁnding a 71.7% accuracy rate, as assessed by an expert oral\nsurgeon. This highlights ChatGPT-4’s potential as a supplementary\nclinical decision-making tool in dentistry, while emphasizing it\ncannot replace the expertise of a qualiﬁed oral surgeon. The study\ncalls for further research to ensure safe and effective use of AI\ntechnologies like ChatGPT-4 in dental specialties.\nChau et al. (93) evaluated ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0 against\ndental licensing exams from the US and UK. ChatGPT 4.0 showed\nimproved performance, accurately answering 80.7% and 62.7% of\nquestions from the UK and US exams, respectively, and even\npassing both exams. This marked improvement over ChatGPT 3.5\nhighlights the potential of Generative Arti ﬁcial Intelligence in\ndental education and professional development, though the study\ncalls for further advancements in GenAI. A study by Rizwan and\nSadiq ( 94)a s s e s s e dC h a t G P T’s capability in diagnosing and\nmanaging cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) through ten hypothetical\nclinical cases. With a successful diagnosis rate in eight cases,\nChatGPT’s responses, veri ﬁed by cardiologists, aligned with\ncurrent medical guidelines. Despite its limitations in providing\nspeciﬁc treatment plans, ChatGPT was found to be a useful tool\nfor medical professionals, particularly for junior doctors, in\nformulating diagnosis and treatment strategies, highlighting the\nimportance of complementing AI with expert clinical judgment.\nBatra et al. (95\n) explored AI’s transformative impact on the dental\nindustry, focusing on its potential to enhance diagnostic and\ntreatment accuracy. The study addresses AI ’s application in\nvarious dental care aspects, including sophisticated imaging,\ndisease detection, and the creation of personalized treatment plans.\nIt also considers ethical and privacy concerns related to AI in\ndentistry, envisioning a future where AI-integrated dental practices\nlead to more efﬁcient, patient-centered, and effective oral health\noutcomes, emphasizing the shift towards leveraging technology to\nimprove the quality of patient care. According to Cheng et al. (96)\nand Hassam et al. (97), GPT-4 can enhance clinical support for\nspinal surgeons and joint arthroplasty by creating AI-based virtual\nassistants. A study by Rao et al. (98) demonstrated ChatGPT’s\nutility in radiologic decision-making and clinical support, while\nother research has demonstrated its effectiveness in providing\ndental hygiene and health information to patients. The results of\nthese studies demonstrate that ChatGPT and GPT-4 are becoming\nincreasingly important as supportive tools in healthcare, enhancing\nprofessional practice and patient care. There are several studies\nthat demonstrate the beneﬁto fa r t iﬁcial intelligence in diagnostics,\ntherapeutic decisions, surgical planning, and prognosis (99). AI is\ncapable of enhancing learning, classi ﬁcation, prediction, and\ndetection, thus potentially reducing human error and augmenting\nthe skills of clinicians. Furthermore, they highlighted the need for\nAI algorithms to undergo rigorous clinical validation and ethical\nscrutiny regarding data protection (100–102). The versatility of AI\nin dentistry is highlighted in numerous studies, demonstrating its\ncapability to enhance diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient\noutcomes. To provide a clearer understanding of the breadth of AI\napplications in dental specialties,Table 3 offers a survey of various\nstudies that explore these developments.\nThe medical ﬁeld often emphasizes algorithmic thinking, but\nhealthcare providers sometimes resort to heuristic decision-\nmaking due to heavy workloads and cognitive demands, which\ncan lead to errors due to factors such as experience, emotional\nstate, fatigue, and personal characteristics. AI is rapidly being\ndeveloped in healthcare and is praised for its ability to support\nmedical decision-making processes and minimize cognitive biases\nand errors. According to the studies, AI methodologies may be\nbeneﬁcial at all stages of patient care, from initial screening to\nrecovery post-surgery (111).\n5 An exploration of the capabilities of\nLLMs in dentistry\nLLMs can automate the comprehension of documents and\nenable the analysis of treatment plans, leveraging the advantages\nof extensive pretraining. Additionally, exposure to billions of\ndocuments helps LLMs develop natural language reasoning (NLR)\ncapabilities for context understanding. This NLR capability can\nenhance the ef ﬁciency of dental practitioners in crafting\npersonalized treatment plans based on patients’ backgrounds. For\nexample, NLR algorithms can scrutinize patterns of adverse drug\nreactions (ADRs) associated with various dental procedures and\nmedications. Understanding common ADRs linked to drugs allows\ndentists to adjust their treatment plans, reducing the likelihood of\nside effects such as gum bleeding and severe conditions like\nbisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis. Alexander Fuchs et al. (112)\nevaluated the effectiveness of ChatGPT versions 3 and 4 by\nemploying questions from the European Examination in Allergy\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 10 frontiersin.org\nand Clinical Immunology (EEAACI) and the Swiss Federal\nLicensing Examination in Dental Medicine (SFLEDM). They\nexplored the effect of priming on enhancing ChatGPT’s responses.\nChatGPT 4 notably outperformed version 3 in all tests, with\npriming improving its performance, especially for SFLEDM\nquestions. This study illustrates the rapid advancement in large\nlanguage model technology and the potential beneﬁts of priming\nyet cautions against the uncritical application of such models in\nhealthcare due to inherent risks and limitations. A study (113)a t\nMeharry Medical College examined ChatGPT’s integration into\nthe dental curriculum, highlighting both its potential and\nchallenges in enhancing dental education. The research analyzed\nthe chatbot’s responses to various queries using course materials,\nshowcasing ChatGPT’s utility in assisting with academic writing\nand content creation. Despite identifying limitations, the study\nemphasizes the importance of rigorous evaluation and the\ncombination of AI technologies like ChatGPT in dental education\nto improve teaching and learning quality.\nA comparative study ( 29) evaluated the performance of\nGPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard using the Japanese National\nDentist Examination (JNDE) to assess their clinical application\npotential in Japan. GPT-4 led in overall correctness, with Bard\nexcelling in essential questions, indicating the distinct capabilities\nand possible clinical uses of these models in dentistry. The\nﬁndings suggest a promising future for LLMs in clinical settings,\nthough further validation is needed to ascertain their global utility.\nKoubaa et al. (114) provided a review of ChatGPT, analyzing its\ntechnological advancements and the breadth of research\nsurrounding it. This ﬁrst extensive literature assessment on\nChatGPT outlines future research challenges and directions,\noffering valuable insights for stakeholders interested in the model’s\napplications, implications, and development prospects. Ana et al.\n(115) critically appraised studies observing the connection between\ndentofacial features and dental trauma among Brazilian children\nand adolescents, focusing on the handling of confounding factors.\nDespite some acknowledgment of biases, the review found a\ngeneral lack of thorough consideration for confounders in these\nstudies, underscoring the difﬁculty in establishing causality from\nsuch research. This highlights the need for more rigorous\nmethodological approaches in observational studies within theﬁeld.\nThe goal of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is to make use of\nhigh-quality medical corpora, such as knowledge graphs (116),\nphysician-patient discussions ( 117), and medical question-\nanswering (118). In order to further pre-train the generic LLMs\nwith the same training objectives, such as next token prediction,\nthe produced SFT data acts as a continuation of the pre-training\nTABLE 3 A survey of AI applications in dentistry.\nAuthors Year Aim Method Result\nAlzaid et al.

Through the additional pre-training period offered by SFT,\ngeneral LLMs can become more knowledgeable about medicine\nand more in line with the medical ﬁeld, enabling them to\nbecome specialized medical LLMs. Supervisedﬁne-tuning (SFT),\nInstruction ﬁne-tuning (IFT), and parameter-efﬁcient tuning are\nsome of the methods used nowadays for ﬁne-tuning ( 119).\nTable 1 provides an overview of the reﬁned medical LLMs that\nwere produced. The ChatGPT AI model utilized in this study is\ntext-based, hence it cannot directly read radiologic images.\nConsequently, the ﬁnal diagnoses were produced using\ndescriptive radiologic results (text data). Future studies could\nbeneﬁt from using AI models for picture segmentation and\ncaptioning to generate radiologic ﬁndings that are descriptive.\nChatGPT can then use these ﬁndings as the foundation for\nfurther diagnostic conclusions (120). The process of describing\nan image’s visual information in natural language using a visual\nunderstanding system and a language model that can produce\ncoherent, syntactically accurate sentences is known as image\ncaptioning (121). In addition, the newly launched ChatGPT4V\nnow supports the entry of photos in addition to text. Writing\nradiological reports could undergo more alterations as a result of\nall these AI models. Figure 6 illustrates a workﬂow in which an\nLLM, integrated with vision language modeling capabilities,\nprocesses an input image of a dental condition such as caries\nand generates a multifaceted output tailored for dental practices.\nThe LLM analyzes the input image to understand the dental\nissue and generates an action plan for the dentist to follow,\nillustrating how arti ﬁcial intelligence can assist with clinical\ndecision-making. Figure 6 illustrates how an LLM can streamline\nthis analysis (122). By reviewing patient histories, NLR can also\nidentify comorbidities, monitor drug safety, and enhance patient\neducation through natural language generation-based medical\ndocumentation utilizes high-quality medical corpora, including\nphysician-patient dialogues ( 123), medical Q&A ( 124), and\nknowledge graphs ( 116, 125), to continue the pretraining of\ngeneral LLMs with the same objectives, such as predicting the\nnext word or phrase. This additional pretraining phase enables\nthe LLMs to acquire extensive medical knowledge and become\nattuned to the medical ﬁeld, effectively transforming them into\nspecialized medical LLMs. Fine-tuning techniques like SFT,\nInstruction Fine-Tuning (IFT), and Parameter-Ef ﬁcient Tuning\nreﬁne these models further. The ﬁndings suggest that dentists\ncould be supported in providing thorough, informed care by a\nsophisticated artiﬁcial intelligence system.\n6 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while AI technologies like ChatGPT have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the ﬁeld of dentistry, their\nintegration into clinical practice should be approached with\nsigniﬁcant caution. The advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have enabled systems like ChatGPT to assist with tasks\nsuch as patient education, diagnostics, and research support.\nHowever, this study strongly emphasizes that the current\ncapabilities of AI are far from sufﬁcient to replace the expertise of\ntrained dental professionals. Future research must involve a more\ndiverse and extensive pool of dentists to critically evaluate AI’s\nrole in dentistry and its ability to generate reliable, nuanced\ninformation. A key concern is the comparison between ChatGPT’s\noutput and that of dental students or postgraduates, which may\nreveal signiﬁcant gaps in AI’s understanding of complex, case-\nspeciﬁc nuances. While ChatGPT can provide general information\nand streamline administrative tasks, it cannot replicate the depth\nof clinical judgment required for personalized treatment. This\nlimitation becomes particularly concerning when considering the\nvariability in patient cases, where AI may oversimplify conditions\nor fail to account for subtle clinical indicators.\nMoreover, the over-reliance on AI systems like ChatGPT in\ndentistry could pose risks to patient safety. Despite the tool ’s\nability to assist in education or initial diagnostics, AI-generated\nadvice should not be blindly trusted or treated as deﬁnitive. There\nis a real danger that patients, or even inexperienced practitioners,\nmight place too much conﬁdence in these systems, leading to\nmisdiagnoses or inadequate treatment plans. ChatGPT’sr e l i a n c e\non pre-existing data and inability to understand real-time clinical\ncontexts underscores its current limitations. The paper urges\nTABLE 4 An overview of existing medical LLMs and their model\ndevelopment.\nDomains Model\ndevelopment\narchetypes\nScale of\nparameters\nData magnitude\nPre-training B-ERT Large Extensive Large-scale data\nPubM-ERT Large Medium Considerable corpus\nClinicalB-ERT Medium Broad clinical notes\nMedC-ERT Medium Ample scienti ﬁc articles\nBioM-ELMo Small Large data repository\nOphthGPT Medium Substantial dialogues\nGatorTron Large Medium Large token database\nGatorTron GP Small Moderate token\ndatabase\nMEDTRON Small Extensive notes\nDoctorLM Medium Vast dialogues\nBioQuest Medium Extensive dialogues\nClinicalGPT Small Wide EHRs and QA\nQliM-Med Small Broad dialogues\nMedical-\ndomain LMs\nCharDoctor Small Focused instructions\nBenTaa Small Speci ﬁc instructions\nHuatoGP Small Extensive instructions\nand dialogues\nBaize-healthcare Medium Broad dialogues\nMedAePac Small/Medium Focused medical QA\nAlpCure Small Speci ﬁc instructions\nZhiyin Small Dedicated instructions\nPMCLLM Medium Extensive tokens\nFine-tuning CPLLM Medium EHRs\nClinical Camel Small/Medium Extensive articles and QA\nMedLP-M Medium Focused medical QA\nBioPump Medium Extensive tokens\nCoeDP Medium Extensive thought pieces\nCadX Small Speci ﬁc instructions\nDr. Kumo Small Zero-shot learning\nCharPZ Small Zero-shot learning\nMedPrompt Medium Dedicated prompting\nMedPromptM Medium Few-shot learning\nFarhadi Nia et al. 10.3389/fdmed.2024.1456208\nFrontiers inDental Medicine 12 frontiersin.org\ndental professionals to recognize that while AI can play a supportive\nrole, it should not undermine the value of human expertise.\nDentistry involves much more than diagnosis. It requires\nunderstanding individual patient needs, providing personalized\ncare, and exercising clinical intuition built through years of\nexperience. The risks associated with overestimating ChatGPT’s\ncapabilities must not be ignored, as errors in diagnosis or\ntreatment planning could have severe implications for patient health.\nTherefore, the future of AI in dentistry must focus on\nresponsible integration, ensuring that AI tools like ChatGPT are\nutilized only as supplementary aids rather than primary decision-\nmakers. Further research must rigorously assess these\ntechnologies to safeguard patient outcomes and ensure that\nhuman expertise remains central to the practice of dentistry. AI,\nwhile a revolutionary tool, must be handled with care, and its\nuse must always be accompanied by a human-centered approach\nto clinical decision-making and treatment.\n6.1 Limitation\nChatGPT offers considerable promise, but it is still in the early\nstages of development. The use of ChatGPT for information comes\nwith ethical considerations, and it cannot be claimed as a doctor.\nHowever, it can be a valuable clinical tool. The human intellect\nr e m a i n si r r e p l a c e a b l eb yC h a t G P T .T oe n s u r et h a tt h em o d e li s\naccurate and reliable before its application in clinical settings, it is\nessential to verify its accuracy and reliability. To overcome the\nlimitations of the ChatGPT model, it is necessary to continuously\nupdate and enhance it, considering user feedback. For healthcare\nprofessionals and patients, it is important to establish clear\nprotocols regarding the appropriate use of ChatGPT. Furthermore,\npolicies must be in place to protect patient conﬁdentiality, and\nethical standards must be established to navigate the complex issues\npresented by the integration of ChatGPT into healthcare.\nAuthor contributions\nMFN: Data curation, Investigation, Resources, Visualization,\nWriting – original draft.
