    "abstract": "Hybrid ac/dc transmission extends the power transfer capacity of existing long ac lines closer to their thermal limit, by superposing the dc current onto three-phase ac lines through a zigzag transformer. However, this transformer could suffer saturation under unbalanced line impedance conditions. This paper introduces the concept of hybrid line impedance conditioner (HLIC) as a cost-effective approach to compensate for the line unbalance and therefore avoid saturation. The topology and operation principle are presented. The two-level control strategy is described, which enables autonomous adaptive regulation without the need of system-level control. Design and implementation are also analyzed, including dc-link capacitance as one of the key line conditioner components, HLIC installation, and protection under fault conditions. The cost study on this HLIC-based hybrid system is also performed to reveal the benefits of the solution. In conclusion, simulation results and experimental results based on a down-scaled prototype are provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.",
