Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT\n(OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google), have emerged as pivotal tools that offer unprecedented\nopportunities to enhance surgical practice \n[1,2]\n. LLMs are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of\ntext data, capable of understanding and generating humanlike text across a wide range of topics and tasks.\nAs experienced surgeons and clinicians, we critically examine the role of LLMs in HPB surgery, highlighting\nboth their transformative potential and the challenges they present. While LLMs offer promising\napplications, their implementation is accompanied by significant considerations that must be carefully\nmanaged. This editorial provides a comprehensive overview of LLM applications in HPB surgery, discusses\nassociated challenges, and offers insights into future directions for their implementation.\nApplications of LLMs in HPB surgery\nClinical Documentation and Administrative Efficiency\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automating clinical documentation, which is a critical\nyet time-consuming aspect of surgical practice \n[3]\n. Studies show that doctors spend 7.7% of their working\ntime on administrative activities \n[4]\n. In HPB surgery, where complex procedures and detailed patient\nhistories are commonplace, LLMs can efficiently generate preoperative assessments, operative notes, and\ndischarge summaries. This not only saves valuable time for surgeons but also enhances the quality and\nconsistency of medical records, potentially improving patient care and facilitating research.\nAugmenting Surgical Decision-Making\nOne of the most significant applications of LLMs in HPB surgery is their potential to support surgical\n1,\n2\n2,\n1\n2,\n1\n2,\n1\n3\n \nOpen Access Editorial\nHow to cite this article\nChen G, Sha Y, Wang Z, et al. (June 14, 2025) The Role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Surgery: Opportunities\nand Challenges. Cureus 17(6): e85979. \nDOI 10.7759/cureus.85979\ndecision-making. By analyzing patient data, including medical histories, imaging studies, and laboratory\nresults, these models can provide surgeons with comprehensive insights into treatment strategies \n[5,6]\n. For\ninstance, in cases of pancreatic cancer or complex liver resections, LLMs can assist in predicting\npostoperative outcomes, helping surgeons tailor their approach to individual patients \n[7,8]\n. Such predictive\ncapabilities can help surgeons tailor their approaches to individual patients, particularly in complex\nscenarios such as borderline resectable pancreatic cancer or patients with significant comorbidities.\nEnhanced Preoperative Planning\nPreoperative planning, a crucial step in HPB surgery, can be significantly improved through LLM\nintegration. When combined with imaging processing systems, these models can interpret complex\nradiological data and help in creating detailed 3D visualizations of anatomical structures \n[9]\n. This capability\nis particularly valuable in liver surgery, where understanding the intricate vascular and biliary anatomy is\nparamount for successful resection. LLM is used in a variety of application scenarios in the medical and\nhealthcare fields, including clinical decision support and administrative task assistance \n[5]\n. In addition, LLM\ncan provide guidance in the perioperative period, for example, by recommending advice on thromboembolic\nprophylaxis \n[10]\n.\nIntraoperative Guidance\nIntraoperatively, LLMs have the potential to serve as real-time decision-support systems. By integrating\nwith surgical navigation systems and processing live data, LLMs can provide instant guidance on critical\ndecisions \n[11]\n. For example, during complex liver resections, an LLM could analyze intraoperative\nultrasound findings and provide recommendations regarding the extent of resection or the management of\nunexpected findings.\nPostoperative Care Optimization\nPostoperative care and follow-up, which are crucial components of HPB surgery, can benefit significantly\nfrom LLM integration. These models can assist in monitoring patient recovery, predicting complications,\nand providing personalized recommendations for follow-up care \n[5,6]\n. This early detection capability is\nparticularly beneficial in managing the complex postoperative course often observed in major HPB\nsurgeries, potentially reducing length of stay and readmission rates.\nQuality Improvement and Research\nFurthermore, LLMs show promise in analyzing surgical outcome data to improve quality improvement\ninitiatives in HPB surgery \n[5]\n. By processing large datasets of patient outcomes, surgical techniques, and\nperioperative management strategies, LLMs can identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent via\ntraditional statistical analyses \n[5,12]\n. Such insights could lead to the development of more effective clinical\npathways and personalized treatment protocols.\nChallenges of LLMs in HPB surgery\nData Privacy and Security\nDespite their promise, the implementation of LLMs in HPB surgery faces significant challenges. Foremost\namong these issues is data privacy and security \n[5-7]\n. The sensitive nature of patient information in surgical\ncontexts necessitates robust safeguards to ensure confidentiality and compliance with regulatory standards,\nsuch as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \n[13]\n. Implementation requires\nadvanced data encryption, secure storage solutions, and strict access controls.\nAccuracy and Reliability Concerns\nThe accuracy and reliability of LLMs in clinical decision-making remain critical concerns. While these\nmodels have shown impressive capabilities, their propensity for \"hallucinations,\" generating plausible but\nincorrect information, poses significant risks in the high-stakes environment of HPB surgery \n[5-7]\n. LLMs can\nproduce errors and misleading information when dealing with technical problems, especially if they are\ntrained with only small datasets \n[14]\n. This highlights the need for rigorous validation protocols and\ncontinuous monitoring of LLM outputs, particularly when used for clinical decision support.\nEthical Considerations and Accountability\nEthical considerations regarding the use of AI in surgical decision-making are paramount. Questions of\naccountability, informed consent, and the potential for algorithmic bias must be addressed before\nwidespread adoption of LLMs in surgical practice can occur \n[5,6,13,15]\n. Some LLMs demonstrated biases in\ntreatment recommendations based on demographic factors, potentially exacerbating existing healthcare\n \n2025 Chen et al. Cureus 17(6): e85979. DOI 10.7759/cureus.85979\n2\n of \n5\ndisparities \n[16]\n. The development of clear guidelines and ethical frameworks for the use of LLMs in surgery\nis an urgent priority in the medical community.\nIntegration With Surgical Education\nThe integration of LLMs into surgical education and training presents both opportunities and challenges.\nWhile these models can provide trainees with access to vast amounts of knowledge and simulated scenarios,\nthere is a risk of overreliance on AI, potentially compromising the development of critical thinking skills\nessential for surgeons \n[5,17,18]\n. A balance must be struck between leveraging LLMs as educational tools and\nensuring that trainees develop independent clinical reasoning abilities. Structured educational frameworks\nthat incorporate LLMs as supplements to, rather than replacements for, traditional mentorship are\nessential \n[19]\n.\nHealthcare Disparities\nMoreover, the potential of LLMs to exacerbate existing healthcare disparities, particularly in resource-\nlimited settings, must be carefully considered \n[20]\n. The implementation of AI technologies requires\nsubstantial infrastructure and expertise, which may not be equally available across healthcare\nsystems \n[21,22]\n. This could lead to a widening gap in the quality of care between well-resourced and\nunderresourced institutions. Strategies to address this challenge include developing lightweight LLM\napplications that can function with limited computational resources and establishing international\ncollaborations to ensure equitable access to these technologies \n[23]\n.\nFuture directions\nMultimodal Learning and Specialized Models\nThe future of LLMs in HPB surgery holds immense promise. Advancements in multimodal learning, which\ncombines text-based knowledge with image and video processing, could lead to more sophisticated surgical\nplanning and intraoperative guidance systems \n[11]\n. The development of specialized LLMs trained on HPB-\nspecific datasets could further increase their utility in complex surgical subspecialties \n[5]\n. These specialized\nmodels, trained on annotated operative reports, imaging studies, and outcome data specific to HPB\nprocedures, have demonstrated superior performance compared to general-purpose LLMs in preliminary\nvalidation studies.\nCollaborative Development\nCollaboration between HPB surgeons and AI researchers is crucial in developing tailored LLMs for surgical\napplications. These partnerships could focus on creating models that incorporate domain-specific\nknowledge, surgical techniques, and outcome data unique to HPB procedures \n[24]\n. The establishment of\ninternational consortia, such as the Surgical AI Collaborative announced in 2024, facilitates the sharing of\nanonymized datasets and technical expertise across institutions \n[25]\n. Such collaborations could also address\nthe need for standardized protocols for validating and implementing LLMs in clinical practice, ensuring\ntheir reliability and effectiveness across different healthcare settings.\nRegulatory Frameworks and Implementation Guidelines\nThe development of robust ethical frameworks and regulatory guidelines for the use of LLMs in surgery is\nimperative to ensure their safe and responsible integration into clinical practice \n[13]\n. Ongoing dialogue\namong surgeons, AI developers, ethicists, and regulatory bodies will be crucial for navigating the complex\nlandscape of AI in healthcare. Several professional societies, including the Society for Surgery of the\nAlimentary Tract and the International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, have recently established\ntask forces to develop specialty-specific guidelines for AI implementation.\nValidation and Quality Control\nImplementation of rigorous quality control measures for training data and model validation is essential for\nensuring the safety and efficacy of LLMs in HPB surgery. This includes the development of standardized\nbenchmarks for assessing model performance, regular auditing of model outputs, and continuous\nmonitoring for bias or errors \n[26]\n. The recent proposal by the American College of Surgeons for an AI\ncertification program represents an important step toward establishing standardized validation protocols for\nsurgical AI applications \n[27]\n.\nConclusion\nThe integration of LLMs in HPB surgery represents a significant advancement in the convergence of AI and\nmedicine. Although these models offer substantial benefits, from streamlining documentation to enhancing\nsurgical decision-making, they also present challenges that must be addressed to realize their full potential.\n \n2025 Chen et al. Cureus 17(6): e85979. DOI 10.7759/cureus.85979\n3\n of \n5\nSpecific recommendations for the HPB surgical community include fostering collaboration with AI\nresearchers, developing specialized LLMs trained on procedure-specific datasets, establishing standardized\nvalidation protocols, and contributing to the development of ethical guidelines for AI implementation.\nAs we navigate this new frontier, collaboration among surgeons, AI researchers, ethicists, and policymakers\nwill be crucial in harnessing the potential of LLMs while safeguarding patient safety and maintaining the\nhighest standards of surgical care. With thoughtful implementation and ongoing refinement, LLMs have the\npotential to transform HPB surgery, ultimately improving outcomes for our patients.\nAdditional Information\nAuthor Contributions\nAll authors have reviewed the final version to be published and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the\nwork.\nConcept and design:\n  \nGuangbin Chen, Yanguang Sha, LongJiang Chen\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:\n  \nGuangbin Chen, Yanguang Sha, Zhilin Wang, Ke Wang,\nLongJiang Chen\nDrafting of the manuscript:\n  \nGuangbin Chen, Yanguang Sha\nCritical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:\n  \nGuangbin Chen, Yanguang Sha,\nZhilin Wang, Ke Wang, LongJiang Chen\nSupervision:\n  \nGuangbin Chen, LongJiang Chen\nDisclosures\nConflicts of interest:\n In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the\nfollowing: \nPayment/services info:\n All authors have declared that no financial support was received from\nany organization for the submitted work. \nFinancial relationships:\n All authors have declared that they have\nno financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might\nhave an interest in the submitted work. \nOther relationships:\n All authors have declared that there are no\nother relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\nAcknowledgements\nGuangbin Chen, Yanguang Sha, and Zhilin Wang contributed equally to this work and should be considered\nco-first authors.
