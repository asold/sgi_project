  "abstract": "The transformer is one of the main components in the power network and transformer windings are one of the most expensive elements in the power transformer. Optimisation of winding distances is one of the most important parameters during the manufacturing of transformer. The distance between the windings in the two winding transformers is well known to transformer designers and manufacturers. However, insulation of the high voltage transformer with additional winding and tap winding is still a major problem for transformer designers. In this study, the additional winding to tap winding distance optimisation is made for a high voltage power transformer. Optimisation of the transformer's windings just not minimises the cost of the transformer but also increases the lifetime of the transformer. With additional winding and tap winding in high‐voltage transformers, insulation distance is a major concern for minimising the cost and size of the high voltage transformer. In this study, an approach is made to balance the cost, size, and safety of high voltage transformers. The optimised distance and position between tap winding and additional winding are determined by using the finite element analysis. The finite element method results were also verified by making a prototype transformer.",
