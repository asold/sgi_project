  "abstract": "The proposed research introduces an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) and Large Language Model (LLM) architecture to enhance the learning process across diverse educational contexts, ranging from school to industrial settings. everaging the capabilities of LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the architecture centers around an immersive VR application. This application empowers students of all backgrounds to interactively engage with their environment by posing questions and receiving informative responses in text format and with visual hints in VR, thereby fostering a dynamic learning experience. LLMs with RAG act as the backbones of this architecture, facilitating the integration of private or domain-specific data into the learning process. By seamlessly connecting various data sources through data connectors, RAG overcomes the challenge of disparate and siloed information repositories, including APIs, PDFs, SQL databases, and more. The data indexes provided by RAG solutions further streamline this process by structuring the ingested data into formats optimized for consumption by LLMs. An empirical study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this VR and LLM architecture. Twenty participants, divided into Experimental and Control groups, were selected to assess the impact on their learning process. The Experimental group utilized the immersive VR application, which allowed interactive engagement with the educational environment, while the Control group followed traditional learning methods. The study revealed significant improvements in learning outcomes for the Experimental group, demonstrating the potential of integrating VR and LLMs in enhancing comprehension and engagement in learning contexts. This study presents an innovative approach that capitalizes on the synergy between LLMs and immersive VR technology, opening avenues for a transformative learning experience that transcends traditional boundaries and empowers learners across a spectrum of educational landscapes.",
