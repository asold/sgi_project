QA tasks typically encompass two \nformats: open-ended and structured. In open-ended QA, respondents provide a complete sentence \nincorporating essential information in response to a question. In structured QA, the question is \npresented with several options, and the respondent selects the correct option or options by its \ncorresponding identifier. Medical QA systems are designed to provide reliable and precise answers \nto questions ranging from disease symptoms and treatment options to medical research findings. \nThese systems leverage advanced technologies like natural language processing (NLP) and \nmachine learn ing approaches to understand and process medical terminology and concepts, \nmaking them invaluable tools for healthcare professionals and patients seeking medical \ninformation. The effectiveness of these systems is crucial, as they directly impact healthcare  \ndecision-making and patient care[2-5].  \nPreviously, transformer models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from \nTransformers) played a pivotal role in QA. For instance, He, Yun, et al.[6] infused disease \nknowledge into a basket of BERT-based models for health question answering, demonstrating the \nviability of disease knowledge infusion in NLP models. And Alzubi, Jafar A., et al.[7] developed \nanother BERT-based model named CoBERT specifically designed for QA related COVID-19. The \nexpansion of medical corpora and textual resources has necessitated leveraging these large datasets \nmore effectively. This need has been met by the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as \na transformative approach to medical QA tasks. Pretrained on extensive and diverse datasets, \nLLMs like GPT -4 possess a  deep understanding of language nuances and medical terminology, \nenabling them to generate highly accurate and relevant responses to medical queries[8]. They \nrepresent a significant milestone while dealing with natural language processing (NLP) tasks[9], \nsuch as text generation[10], question answering (QA)[11], Named Entity Recognition (NER)[12], \n .

These LLMs, \ncharacterized by their vast size, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in  understanding and \ngenerating human language across a diverse array of domains[15]. \nCurrently, the development and application of LLMs face distinct challenges based on their \naccessibility and capabilities[16]. On the one hand, closed-source models, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-\n4, and PaLM2[17], often maintained by large corporations, demonstrate advanced capabilities yet \nlack public accessibility. This limitation restricts their use in broader research and application \ncontexts, including the situation of medical QA, especially when it comes to customized \nenhancements or applying potentially powerful techniques like fine-tuning[18]. On the other hand, \nopen-source LLMs, like Open Llama2[19], Vicuna[14], and Alpaca[20], grant accessibility and \ntransparency, as well as fine -tuning methods that are capable of making significant \nimprovements[18]. A nota ble LLM instance in the medical QA context is PMC -LLama[20], \nexemplifying how fine-tuning an open-source LLM can lead to considerable improvements in its \napplication, such as medical QA. However, this raises another significant challenge, which is the \nhigh cost associated with training and fine -tuning these models. The computational resources \nrequired for training LLMs with billions of parameters are substantial, making it impractical for \nindividual researchers or small organizations to train these models f rom scratch[21]. In the \nhealthcare and biomedical domain, the challenge is further compounded by the need for domain -\nspecific knowledge[22 -24]. Furthermore, selecting a suitable LLM for a specific biomedical \napplication is not straightforward[25]. The choi ce of a model often depends on various factors, \nincluding the nature of the medical queries, the required level of accuracy, and the availability of \ndomain-specific training data[10, 23, 26-27]. \nEnsemble method is a meta -approach stemming from machine learning techniques. In machine \nlearning, ensemble involves combining multiple models to improve the overall performance, \n .

Techniques including voting[30 -31], \nboosting[33], and bagging (bootstrap aggregating) [28 -29, 32 -33] are common ensembling \napproaches with better predictive performance by combining the predictions with multiple models \nor multiple past predictions. In the context of LLMs, model ensembles can potentially harness the \ndiverse strengths of individual models to achieve superior results[31, 34-35]. These methods work \neffectively because they mitigate the weaknesses of single-model approaches. Each LLM, with its \nunique training data and architecture, may have specific strengths and biases[36-38]. Ensembling \nvarious models, each with distinct origins and structures, can equilibrate their inherent biases, \nmitigate overfitting, and enhance the generalization capacity for new data[39]. Importantly, this \nensembling approach does not necessitate the models to be exclusively open -source or closed -\nsource, nor does it demand extensive computational resources for its executio n. Moreover, \nensembling enables leveraging both domain-specific and general-purpose models. For instance, a \ngeneral-purpose LLM might excel in understanding the context and semantics of a question, while \na domain -specific LLM might provide more accurate te chnical information[20, 27, 40]. \nCombining these models can yield comprehensive and contextually relevant responses, crucial in \nmedical scenarios.  \nCertain challenges lie in how to effectively ensemble LLMs, especially within the medical domain. \nThis integration must consider factors such as the compatibility of different models, the method of \naggregating their outputs and maintaining the interpretabi lity of the responses. These \nconsiderations are crucial for ensuring that the ensemble not only performs well but also aligns \nwith the stringent requirements of medical applications. There have been only a few studies diving \ninto Ensembling LLMs to achieve  a better prediction, like LLM -Blender[34], which implements \nPairRanker and Genfuser as an ensemble framework to generate consistently better responses for \na given input. Similarly, the majority voting method proposed by Pitis, Silviu et al.[35] \ndemonstrates potential. However, these studies primarily focus on open -ended tasks and do not \ndelve into the specifics of medical QA, nor do they include domain -specific LLMs like \n .

Furthermore, their applicability to structured QA with single-\nchoice or multiple-choice questions in the medical domain remains unexplored, presenting unique \nchallenges related to specificity, privacy, and data scarcity in medical contexts. This gap indicates \nthe need for further research on the effective ensembling of LLMs tailored to the specific \nrequirements of medical QA. \nTo address these limitations, we introduce LLM-Synergy, a novel ensembling framework tailored \nfor medical QA, with two well -designed meta -learning ensembling methods, providing two \ninnovative approaches combining the strengths of various LLMs, named Boosti ng-based \nWeighted Majority Vote Ensemble[35, 41 -42] and Cluster-based Dynamic Model selection[43]. \nTo validate the efficacy of LLM -Synergy and its ensemble methods, we conducted a case study \nusing three medical QA datasets: MedMCQA[44], PubMedQA[45], and MedQA-USMLE[46].  \nOur contributions to this study include the following: \n1) The development of innovative LLM ensemble methods, specifically the Boosting -based \nWeighted Majority Vote Ensemble and Cluster -based Dynamic Model Selection, offers \nnew approaches, with zero-shot cases, in the medical QA field. \n2) We implemented the ensembling methods for LLM methods and improved the \nperformance by 5.98%, 1.09%, and 0.87% compared to the best-performing LLM on three \nmedical QA datasets,  the effectiveness of our ensemble methods. In each case, a tailored \nensemble framework was created and adapted to the format of the QA dataset (single -\nchoice or multiple-choice formats). \n3) We conducted an error analysis to provide insights and directions for potential future \nenhancements in the field of medical QA, laying the groundwork for further improvements \nin this domain.  \n .

Within the benchmark, we conduct \na sampled test, randomly drawing 200 QA pairs from the three medical QA datasets to assess the \ncurrent capabilities of these LLMs in a medical context as a starting point. This benchmarking \nserves as a foundational analysis to understand the  individual strengths and limitations of each \nLLM in handling medical QA tasks. Illustrated by Figure 1 overviewing of the whole pipeline of \nLLM-Synergy, following the benchmark assessment, the next phase focuses on the training \nprocess of our two proposed  ensembling methods within LLM -Synergy: the Boosting -based \nWeighted Majority Vote Ensemble and the Cluster -based Dynamic Model Selection. The two \napproaches are designed to combine the unique capabilities of the selected LLMs, aiming to \nenhance the overall performance of medical QA systems. Moreover, the second method could be \nre-graded as an extensive version of the first one. By implementing these methods, we seek to \naddress the shortcomings of relying on single models and reduce the need for extensive individual \nmodel training, thereby creating a more robust and efficient solution for medical QA. \n .

Overview of our LLM-Synergy Framework \nDataset \nWe used three medical QA datasets for our model training and test: MedMCQA[44], \nPubMedQA[45], and MedQA-USMLE[46]. \nMedMCQA, released in March 2022 by Pal, Umapathi et al.[41], is a comprehensive multiple -\nchoice question dataset derived from mock and past examinations of AIIMS and NEET -PG (Pal, \nUmapthi, et al. 2022), two prominent Indian medical entrance exams. It encom passes a training \nset with 182,822 questions and a test set comprising 4,183 questions, covering over 2,400 topics. \nEach question in this dataset presents four answer choices, labeled from A to D. \nPubMedQA, introduced in September 2019 by Jin, Dhingra et al.[42], is a QA dataset curated from \nPubMed abstracts. It includes 1,000 questions reviewed by experts and 272,500 algorithmically \ngenerated QA pairs. The dataset's primary task is to classify rese arch questions into yes, no, or \nmaybe answers, akin to multiple-choice questions. It is divided into three segments: PQA -L with \n1k manually labeled pairs, PQA -U with 61.2k unlabeled pairs, and PQA -A featuring 211.3k \nartificially generated pairs.

This dataset \nencompasses questions in three languages: English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese, \nwith a total of 12,724, 34,251, and 14,123 questions in each respective language. Each question \noffers five choices, ranging from option A to E, sourced from professional medical board \nexaminations. Here, we only experimented with the English QA parts. \nThe detailed LLM prompt can be found in the Appendix. \nLLM Benchmark on the three medical QA datasets \nAhead of implementing our ensembling framework, as a benchmark study, we evaluate the \nperformance of various LLMs on 200 questions from each of the three QA datasets, respectively: \nPubMedQA, MedQA-USMLE, and MedMCQA, adhering to their specific answer formats. We \nevaluate our model's performance against several robust baselines relying on the Language \nModel (LLM).

There may be different strategies for initialization, and \nwe chose equally weighted initialization, which is the most common way of initialization[47]. \nStep 3: Prediction and Weight Adjustment \nWe chose a baseline LLM, denote as 𝐿𝐿𝑀!\there, and focus on its wrong prediction: Use  𝐿𝐿𝑀! to \npredict answers for the training set and adjust the weights based on the prediction of instance: If \nthe prediction, 𝑦!#* for instance 𝑖, is incorrect, minus the weight of its corresponding LLM, 𝐿𝐿𝑀!, \nby an adjustment parameter 𝛼, i.e. 𝑤$ ← 𝑤$ + 𝛼, where 𝛼 is a factor that increases the weight, \nindicating that the instance needs more attention in the next round of training. \nStep 4: Iterative Training with Additional Models \nFor each subsequent LLM ( 𝐿𝐿𝑀\", 𝐿𝐿𝑀%, . ..), repeat the prediction process. If a model correctly \npredicts the answer, we maintain the current weights. If the prediction 𝑦&#*   is incorrect, the weights \nwere adjusted again. \nStep 5: Finalize Weights of the Model Ensemble \nAfter training and weight adjustments across all LLMs are completed, the final ensemble model is \nformed, which combines the individual LLMs with the final set of adjusted weights. \n .

Training Process of Cluster-based Dynamic Model Selection Ensemble \nFigure 4 shows the training process of our second approach: Cluster -based Dynamic Model \nSelection, which serves as an extensive approach to the first one. \nStep 1: Dataset Preparation \nSame as Part 1, for a given medical Question -Answering (QA) dataset, split it into a training set \nand a validation set with a ratio of 80:20. Each QA-pair instance in the dataset should consist of a \nquestion paired with single-choice options. \nStep 2: Question Context Tokenization \nExtract the context of each question from the QA pairs, and use the tokenizer, from Clinical-BERT \nin our case,  to convert each question context into a series of tokens. \nStep 3: Encoding and Pooling \nEmploy an encoder (same model as step 2, Clinical-BERT in our case) along with a mean-pooling \nmethod to encode each question's tokens into a 768x1 embedding vector. Through this encoder \npart, we obtained a constructed embedding matrix for the entire set of  questions, where each row \nrepresents the embedded vector of a question. \n .

This \nstep assigns each question a cluster label, effectively reducing the dimensionality from 768 of an \nindividual question vector to a single cluster group label bei ng 1,2,3, … K. It serves as an \nunsupervised learning step that categorizes questions into different clusters based on their \nembeddings achieved after Step 3. \nStep 5: Training Within Clusters \nFor each cluster group identified in the previous step, implement the Majority Weighted Vote \ntrainer in Part 1, then determine the best combination of weights for the ensemble of LLMs within \neach group. These weights are adjusted to maximize the prediction  accuracy of the ensemble \nwithin the specific context of each cluster. \nStep 6: Validation and Tuning \nIteratively apply steps 2 to 5 to the validation set as well, and adjust and tune the hyperparameters \nof the clustering algorithm(K in KMeans in our case) to achieve the best overall accuracy on the \nvalidation set. This step is crucial for optimizing the m odel's performance and ensuring that the \nclustering effectively captures the nuances of different question contexts. \nEvaluation \nIn the evaluation phase of our study, same as others[21, 36, 44, 46], accuracy was employed as the \nprimary metric for assessment, given its congruence with the Micro F1 score in our specific \nexperimental context of single-choice or multiple-choice QA tasks. Given the nature of multiple-\nchoice QA datasets, metrics such as Recall and Precision are deemed inappropriate as they are \nsensitive to changes in the option numbering. For instance, adjusting the order of option labels \nmay result in altering these metri c values, when the number of options exceeds two. Based on \n .

This \ndistinct separation ensures an unbiased evaluation of the model's true predictive capabilities. The \ntest sets are derived from the subsets of the MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MedQA -USMLE \ndatasets, respectively. The MedMCQA test dataset consists of 4,183 QA pairs. The PubMedQA \ntest dataset is even more extensive with 11,269 QA pairs. Whereas, the MedQA-USMLE dataset \ncontains 1,272 QA pairs. \n \nRESULTS \nIn the presented study, the performance of various Large Language Models (LLMs) was evaluated \nagainst ensemble methods across three distinct medical QA datasets, MedMCQA, PubmedQA, \nand MedQA-USMLE. The performance metric, assumed to be an accuracy score, h ighlights the \ndifferential capabilities of each LLM and our two established predictors of ensemble methods.

Medllama-13B showed a similar trend, albeit with marginally lower accuracy figures \nacross the board, peaking at 86.11% for the PubmedQA dataset. \nMedalpaca-13B yielded a divergent performance profile, exhibiting a relatively lower accuracy of \n27.97% on PubmedQA, while achieving the highest accuracy among individual LLMs on the \nMedQA-USMLE dataset at 37.26%. This suggests that Medalpaca -13B may posse ss particular \nstrengths in processing the content typified within the MedQA-USMLE exam questions. Vicuna-\n13B, on the other hand, had the lowest accuracy scores for all datasets, which could indicate a \ngeneral difficulty with the medical QA task as presented in these datasets. \nThe ensemble approaches, notably the Majority Weighted Vote ensemble and the Dynamic \nSelection ensemble, were developed to leverage the collective strengths of the individual LLMs. \nThe Majority Weighted Vote Ensemble surpassed the individual model performa nces on the \nMedMCQA and MedQA -USMLE datasets and achieved a notable accuracy of 96.21% on \nPubmedQA.

The specific range of improvement varies from the variation of each LLM.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe results underscore the variability in model performance across different medical QA contexts \nand the potential of ensemble methods to enhance prediction accuracy. The Dynamic Selection \nEnsemble, in particular, illustrates the advantages of a flexible approach that tailors model \nselection to the specific context of each question, aligning with the increasing demand for precision \nin medical informatics applications. \nThe LLM-Synergy ensemble framework is marked by its robust architecture, offering a suite of \nadvantages that enhance its utility in the field of machine learning. Central to its design is the \nprinciple of scalability, which allows the framework to integrat e an expanding roster of Large \nLanguage Models (LLMs) or extend to accommodate larger datasets with minimal structural \nadjustments. Flexibility is another cornerstone of the LLM-Synergy framework, demonstrated by \nits support for both zero -shot and multiple-shot applications, and its agnostic approach to model \nsourcing, accepting LLMs irrespective of their open-source or closed-source status. This versatility \nensures that the framework is not limited by the availability or proprietary nature of models, thus \nbroadening its applicability. Beyond its flexibility, LLM -Synergy is characterized by domain \nadaptability, with an underlying methodology that transcends the medical question -answering \ndomain for which it was initially designed. Its principles are equally relevant to question -\nanswering tasks in various other fields, indicating its potential for extensive adoption beyond the \nconfines of healthcare. In terms of computational efficiency, LLM -Synergy stands out by \nharnessing the strengths of pre -existing, pre-trained models, thereby circumventing the necessity \nfor extensive retraining. This attribute not only conserves computational resources but also \n .

Additionally, the framework's operational efficiency is \nexemplified by its modest demand for computing power, distinguishing it from many \ncontemporary models that often require substantial computational investment. Another  key \nadvantage is the robustness of the ensemble approach, which integrates insights from multiple \nmodels to produce a more reliable and error-resistant output. By aggregating diverse perspectives, \nLLM-Synergy mitigates the influence of individual model bi ases or inaccuracies, resulting in a \nmore dependable collective judgment.  \nCollectively, these advantages position the LLM -Synergy framework as a scalable, flexible, and \ncomputationally prudent choice for diverse machine learning applications, promising significant \nadvancements in the realm of AI-driven problem-solving. \nError Analysis \nIn the context of our LLM -Synergy framework, the efficacy of both ensemble methods is \ncontingent upon the variance in performance among the incorporated LLMs. Within the \nMedMCQA dataset, the discrepancy in performance metrics among the LLMs was relatively \nnarrow, with Llama2-13B achieving the apex at 32.03% and Vicuna -13B at the nadir at 26.13% \nin the individual case. Subsequent to integration into the ensemble framework, the LLMs \ndemonstrated a capacity for reciprocal augmentation of their respective predi ctive strengths, \nculminating in an appreciable performance enhancement of 5.98%. In contrast, the PubMedQA \ndataset exhibited a more homogenized performance distribution, with even the least accurate LLM, \nMedllama-13B, attaining an accuracy rate of 86.11%. This scenario yielded an incremental, albeit \nless substantial, improvement post-ensemble due to the already elevated baseline accuracies. The \nMedQA-USMLE dataset, in other words, presents a distinctive case; Medalpaca -13B's \nperformance markedly surpasses i ts counterparts. In such instances, a static Majority Weighted \nVote approach inherently biases the ensemble towards this single model, potentially allocating \n100% of the weight to Medalpaca-13B and negating the contributions of other LLMs. Conversely, \n .

One notable \nconstraint is the dependency on the quality and diversity of the LLMs in corporated into the \nensemble. The performance of the ensemble is inherently tied to the individual capabilities of the \nincluded models. If these models share common blind spots or biases, or if they are not sufficiently \ndiverse in their approaches to problem-solving, the ensemble may not significantly outperform its \nindividual constituents. \nFor the Weighted Majority Vote Ensemble, a key limitation lies in its static nature. The weights \nassigned to each model are fixed after training and do not adapt to the nuances of individual \nquestions or contexts within the test set. This could lead to sub optimal performance in situations \nwhere the most appropriate model might change depending on specific question characteristics. \nThe Dynamic Model Selection framework, while more adaptable, relies heavily on the clustering \nalgorithm's ability to meaningfull y categorize questions. If the clustering does not effectively \ncapture the relevant features that dictate which LLM would perform best, the dynamic selection \nprocess may not yield the intended improvements. Additionally, this method's success is \ncontingent upon the availability of a sufficiently large and representative validation set to fine-tune \nthe model selection process. Moreover, both frameworks could still potentially be limited by \ncomputational constraints in practice, even if not computationally hu ngry as methods like fine -\ntuning or pretraining. Despite being designed to be resource -efficient, the process of integrating \nmultiple complex models, especially when scaling up to include additional LLMs or \naccommodating larger datasets, could still demand  significant computational resources.  \n .

This may not hold if there are substantial differences between \nthe validation and test sets, leading to a discrepancy b etween expected and actual performance. \nTherefore, while the LLM-Synergy frameworks offer promising approaches to ensemble learning \nin NLP, they must be applied judiciously, with an awareness of these potential limitations. \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe LLM-Synergy framework, with its boosting-based Weighted Majority Vote and cluster-based \nDynamic Model Selection methods, represents a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for \nmedical QA tasks and provides an innovative way of efficiently utilizin g the development with \nLLM Technologies, customing for both existing and potentially future challenge tasks in \nbiomedical and health informatics research. Its ability to amalgamate the strengths of multiple \nmodels has demonstrated superior accuracy and rob ustness over individual LLMs. While the \nframework showcases scalability, flexibility, and adaptability across domains, it also presents \nopportunities for future enhancements, including increased model diversity, dynamic weighting, \nand broader domain applications. As such, LLM-Synergy not only addresses current challenges in \nnatural language processing but also sets the stage for continued innovation in AI-driven problem-\nsolving.  \nDATA AVAILABILITY \nThe LLM-synergy framework used in this study is made publicly available at https://github.com- \n/serendipitYang/LLM-Synergy. \n .
