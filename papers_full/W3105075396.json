The main drivers of strong disturbances of the\nsolar wind are coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the fast–slow\nsolar wind interaction on the borders of corotating interaction\nregions, and fast-wind outﬂows from coronal holes. Solar-wind\ndisturbances may ultimately interact with Earth’s magneto-\nsphere, thereby triggering geomagnetic activity.\nAs ﬁrst proposed byDungey (1961), the dynamic pressure\nexerted by the solar wind on the magnetosphere can trigger\nmagnetic reconnection, opening dayside dipolar geomagnetic\nﬁeld lines. The solar wind then transports this magneticﬁeld\nto the nightside, forming a long tail behind the Earth. This trans-\nfer of magnetic ﬂux and the resulting reconﬁguration of the\nmagnetosphere eventually leads to nightside magnetic reconnec-\ntion, returningﬂux to the dayside in various phenomenological\nresponse modes that depend on the disturbance level (Dungey,\n1961; Kepko et al., 2014). However, a common characteristic of\nall such response modes is the formation of a current wedge sys-\ntem (Kepko et al., 2014; McPherron & Chu, 2017). A fraction\nof the tail current along geomagneticﬁeld lines is then tem-\nporarily diverted through the ionosphere, allowing a closure\nof the current wedge and causing perturbations in the auroral\nzone and at middle latitudes (McPherron & Chu, 2017).\nBoth substorms and geomagnetic storms give rise to a cur-\nrent wedge, plasma sheet inward convection by inductive electric\nﬁelds, and energetic particle injections (Thomsen, 2004; Kepko\net al., 2014; Ganushkina et al., 2017; McPherron & Chu, 2017).\nTopical Issue - Geomagnetic Storms and Substorms: a Geomagnetically Induced Current perspective\n*Corresponding author: michal@astronomie.cz\nJ. Space Weather Space Clim. 2020,10,2 6\n/C211M. Švanda et al., Published byEDP Sciences 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/swsc/2020025\nAvailable online at:\nwww.swsc-journal.org\nOPEN ACCESSRESEARCH ARTICLE\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nHowever, the current wedge has generally a more limited\ntemporal extent during substorms than during storms, which fre-\nquently last for days (Kepko et al., 2014; Ganushkina et al.,\n2017). Substorms are one of the key dynamical processes occur-\nring during storms, but isolated substorms also occur outside\nstorms (Viljanen et al., 2006; Turnbull et al., 2009). During\nstorms (mainly caused by strong interactions between CMEs\nand the magnetosphere), a stronger buildup of the inner ring\ncurrent (a westward current of ions roughly ~ 2–4 Earth radii\nabove the equator) is provided by a deeper inward transport of\ncharged particles from the plasma sheet, leading to a signiﬁcant\nand prolonged decrease of the geomagneticﬁeld (Ganushkina\net al., 2017).\nAll these ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, and the\nrelated ﬁeld-aligned currents, can cause important geomagnetic\nﬁeld variations during periods of rapidly evolving solar wind\ndynamic pressure (Gonzalez et al., 1994; Kappenman, 2005;\nTsurutani et al., 2009; Lakhina & Tsurutani, 2016; McPherron\n&C h u ,2 0 1 7). This realization has led to the traditional concept\nof disturbed days: days of smooth and regular geomagneticﬁeld\nvariations have been calledquiet days, whereas days of stronger\nand irregular variations have been called disturbed days\n(Chapman & Bartels, 1940).\nGeomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in the ground are\ndue to strong variations dH/dt of the horizontal componentH of\nthe geomagneticﬁeld over typical time scales of ~ 10/C0 1000 s\nduring disturbed days ( Kappenman, 2003 ; Kataoka &\nPulkkinen, 2008; Carter et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Pokhrel\net al., 2018). Substorms generally produce the largest dH/dt at\nhigh and mid-latitudes during periods of fast solar wind and\nhave caused many of the major GIC impacts during large\nstorms – e.g., the Quebec voltage collapse on 13 March 1989\nwas triggered by aﬁrst substorm, while two later substorms\ntripped out transformers in the UK (Boteler, 2019). dH/dt\nwas\nfound to be twice smaller in general during non-storm sub-\nstorms than during storm-related substorms, possibly due to\nan additional input from ring current variations during storms\n(Viljanen et al., 2006; Turnbull et al., 2009). Other important\nsources of dH/dt during geomagnetic storms include sudden\ncommencements (the shock compression of the magnetosphere\nwhen a fast CME impacts the magnetosphere at the start of a\nstorm, leading to an increase of Chapman-Ferraro currents at\nthe dayside magnetopause; e.g., seeKikuchi et al., 2001)a n d\nrapid variations of the ring current, through its role in the\ngeneration of Region 2 ﬁeld-aligned currents (Ganushkina\net al., 2017). Sudden commencements have a large dH/dt\nbecause of their shock-like nature, while rapid increases of ring\ncurrent energy density following large scale injection or inward\nconvection of energetic charged particles coming from the\nplasma sheet can also produce large d H/dt (Kappenman,\n2003, 2005; Kataoka & Pulkkinen, 2008).\nGICs propagate through conducting regions in the ground\nand water, but also in the grounded conductors. The presence\nof GICs in the electric power grid can cause various kinds of\ndamage. GICs are quasi-DC currents that can lead to half-cycle\nsaturation and drive a transformer response into a non-linear\nregime. This poses a risk for transformers by producing high\npulses of magnetizing current, a local heating (also vibration)\nwithin the transformer (Gaunt, 2014), and the generation of\nAC harmonics that propagate out into the power network, where\nthey can disrupt the operations of various devices (Molinski,\n2002; Kappenman, 2007). In particular, the propagation of\nharmonics in the power grid during half-cycle saturation can\ndistort the electrical current waveform, eventually triggering a\ndetrimental reaction of protective relays connecting power lines,\nor leading to a disruption of other devices attached to these\nlines.\nGICs identiﬁed by fast variations of the geomagneticﬁeld\nhave been linked with various power grid failures (Schrijver\n& Mitchell, 2013), eventually leading to power grid disruptions\n(Pirjola, 2000; Kappenman, 2007; Schrijver & Mitchell, 2013;\nPulkkinen et al., 2017). Although high latitude regions are more\nat risk from GICs, middle and low latitude regions may also be\nimpacted by signiﬁcant GICs (Gaunt & Coetzee, 2007; Watari\net al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2012; Torta et al., 2012; Zois, 2013;\nCarter et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Bailey\net al., 2017; Lotz & Danskin, 2017;\nTozzi et al., 2019).\nA ﬁrst study of anomalies in the Czech power grid as a func-\ntion of geomagnetic activity (deﬁned by theK index computed\nfrom the measurements of the Earth’s magneticﬁeld at a local\nmagnetometer station near Budkov– e.g., see Mayaud, 1980;\nMcPherron & Chu, 2017) has already identiﬁed some statisti-\ncally signiﬁcant increases of the rate of anomalies around\nmonth-long periods of higher geomagnetic activity than nearby\nperiods of lower activity (Výbošt’oková & Švanda, 2019).\nNevertheless, the relationship between geomagnetic events\nand anomalies still remained somewhat loose.\nAccordingly, the main goal of the present paper is to better\nascertain the existence of a tight relationship between power\ngrid anomalies and geomagnetic storms, on the basis of the\nsame data set. We shall discuss the physical mechanisms by\nwhich GICs may cause anomalies in power lines and transform-\ners, and show that our statistical results are suggestive of a\ncausal relationship based on those mechanisms. We shall also\naddress the important and unanswered question of the time\ndelay between moderate to large geomagnetic storms with min-\nimum Dst < /C0 40 nT (Gonzalez et al., 1994) and the actual\noccurrences of anomalies. For that purpose, we shall use Super-\nposed Epoch Analysis to investigate the relative occurrence of\nGIC effects in the Czech power grid during disturbed days as\ncompared with quiet days. Such disturbed days will be catego-\nrized using different time-integrated parameters of geomagnetic\nactivity, related to the magnitude of temporal variations of the\nhorizontal component of the geomagnetic ﬁeld, which can\ninduce detrimental currents in power lines.\n2 Data sets\nIn this study, we searched for a causal relation between two\ntypes of time series. Theﬁrst series describing the daily anom-\naly rates in the Czech electric power-distribution grid, and the\nsecond serving as a proxy of disturbed days for the estimation\nof geomagnetically induced currents.\n2.1 Logs of anomalies\nThe Czech Republic is a mid-latitude country (around\n/C24 50/C176geographic latitude and/C24 45/C176corrected geomagnetic\nlatitude), where the effects of solar/geomagnetic activity on\nground-based infrastructures is expected to be moderate at most.\nM. Švanda et al.: J. Space Weather Space Clim. 2020,10,2 6\nPage 2 of 31\nThe modelled amplitudes of GICs during the Halloween storms\nin late October 2003 reached 1-minute peaks of about 60 A.1\nThe country has a shape prolonged in the east–west direction\n(about 500 km length), whereas in the south–north direction it\nis about 280 km long from border to border. The spine of the\nelectric power network is operated by the national operator\nČEPS, a.s., which maintains the very-high-voltage (400 kV\nand 220 kV) transmission network, and connects the Czech\nRepublic with neighbouring countries.ČEPS also maintains\nthe key transformers and electrical substations in the transmis-\nsion network. The area of the state is then split into three\nregions, where the electricity distribution is under the responsi-\nbility of the distribution operators. The southern part is main-\ntained by E.ON Distribuce, a.s., the northern part byČEZ\nDistribuce, a.s., and the capital city of Prague is maintained\nby PREdistribuce, a.s. All three distributors maintain not only\nvery-high-voltage (110 kV) and high-voltage (22 kV) power\nlines, but also connect the consumers via the low-voltage\n(400 V) electric power transmission network.\nAll four above-mentioned power companies have agreed to\nprovide us their maintenance logs. The datasets used in this\nstudy are exactly the same datasets already used in the study\nby Výbošt’oková & Švanda (2019). Thus, we refer the reader\nto Section 3.2 of this previous paper for a more detailed descrip-\ntion of the datasets. By mutual non-disclosure agreement with\nthe data providers, the datasets were anonymised (by removing\nthe information about the power-company name, and also by\nchanging the calendar date to a day number) and must be pre-\nsented as such. The total time span is 12 years, but the span of\nindividual maintenance logs provided by the operators is\nshorter, varying between 6 and 10 years.\nWe only brieﬂy recall that the obtained logs were cleaned\nfrom events that were obviously not related to variations of geo-\nmagnetic activity. From these logs, we keep only the dates when\nthe events occurred and did not consider any other details.\nThese inhomogeneous datasets (the log entries were provided\nby different individuals with varying levels of details and qual-\nity of the event description) were split into 12 subsets D1–D12,\nwhich were investigated separately. Each sub-dataset was\nselected so that it contained only events occurring on devices\nof a similar type and/or with the same voltage level and were\nrecorded by the same operating company. The dataset descrip-\ntions are brieﬂy summarised inTable 1.\n2.2 Geomagnetic indices and parameters used\nfor GIC estimation\nVarious parameters have been considered to estimate the\neffects of geomagnetic activity on power grids (Schrijver &\nMitchell, 2013). GICs are due to strong variations dH/dt over\ntypical time scales of/C24 10–1000 s (Kappenman, 2003). There\nare two sources of such large dH/dt at low and middle latitudes:\n(i) sudden impulses (SI), also called sudden commencements\n(SC) when they are followed by a storm caused by the shock\npreceding a fast CME, and (ii) the growth and decay of the ring\ncurrent during a magnetic storm. Substorm-related disturbances\nare mostly limited to high and middle latitudes, whereas distur-\nbances caused by ring current changes generally affect mainly\nmiddle and low latitudes. Statistically, periods of stronger\ncumulative effects of GICs in a power grid are therefore\nexpected to correspond todisturbed daysof elevated geomag-\nnetic activity (Chapman & Bartels, 1940). In the present study,\nwe shall use various cumulative (time-integrated) parameters\nbased on different magnetic indices to categorize such disturbed\ndays, and we shall investigate the relative occurrence of GIC\neffects during such disturbed days as compared with quiet days.\nAn appropriate quantity to estimate GICs at low latitudes is\nd(SYM-H)/dt, which directly provides a (longitudinally aver-\naged) measure of the 1-minute dH/dt d u et or i n gc u r r e n t\nvariations that drive GICs there (Kappenman, 2003; Carter\net al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Indeed, the SYM-H index is\nessentially similar to the hourlyDst storm time index, but mea-\nsured on 1-minute time scales– that is, it provides the distur-\nbance DH = H /C0 H\nquiet of the horizontal component of the\nmagnetic ﬁeld as compared to its quiet-time level, longitudinally\naveraged based on ground magnetometer measurements at\ndifferent low latitude magnetometer stations (Mayaud, 1980).\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the existence of signiﬁ-\ncant correlations between GICs or electric grid failures\nand times of large d(SYM-H)/dt at low to middle latitudes\nduring geomagnetic storms, although d(SYM-H)/dt is often\nTable 1.

(2015)have\nfurther shown that the actual dH/dt at middle latitudes due to\nS I / S C sc a nb eaf a c t o r/C24 2–3 larger on the dayside than\nd(SYM-H)/dt, potentially allowing GIC effects even during\ngeomagnetic events with relatively small d(SYM-H)/dt.W e\nchecked that dH/dt at the Czech magnetometer station of\nBudkov can also be sometimes > 2 –3 times larger than\nd(SYM-H)/dt during SI/SCs.Viljanen et al. (2014)have noticed\nthe presence of a European region of low underground conduc-\ntivity stretching from France through Czech Republic to\nHungary that could favor signiﬁcant GICs at middle latitudes.\nGil et al. (2019)have shown the presence of GICs during a\nfew selected storms in Poland, whileTozzi et al. (2019)have\nfound that non-negligible GICs could exist even down to north-\nern Italy. Wang et al. (2015) have further emphasized that\ncumulative GICs in a nuclear plant transformer during a long-\nduration geomagnetic event could sometimes be more harmful\nthan short events, due to the longer cumulated time of trans-\nformer heating.\nAccordingly, we consider here the Int(d(SYM-H)/dt)\nparameter to categorize disturbed days of expected signiﬁcant\nGIC impacts on power grids.Int(d(SYM-H)/dt) is calculated\nover each day, as the sum of all 1-minute |d(SYM-H)/dt| values\n(in nT/min) obtained during times when SYM-H remains\nsmaller than some threshold. The selected threshold (varying\nfrom /C0 50 nT to/C0 25 nT) should ensure that only geomagnetic\nstorm periods are considered (Gonzalez et al., 1994). This\nInt(d(SYM-H)/dt) parameter allows, in principle, to take into\naccount the immediate effects on power grids caused by large\nindividual |dH/dt| due to ring current variations, as well as the\nmore delayed, cumulative effects potentially caused by pro-\nlonged periods of moderate to signiﬁcant |dH/dt| levels (Carter\net al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015\n; Zhang et al., 2016) – although\nlarge individual |dH/dt| during strong substorms will need other\nindices such asAE or ap to take them into account (see below).\nOther works have suggested that the mean or cumulative\nDst during storm main phase should be good indicators of long\nduration GICs, because larger and steeper decreases ofDst cor-\nrespond to stronger disturbances that should generally lead to\nlarger dH/dt at the relevant shorter time scales of/C24 10–1000 s\n(Balan et al., 2014, 2016; Lotz & Danskin, 2017). Using obser-\nvations in South Africa (at middle corrected geomagnetic\nlatitudes /C24 36/C176–42/C176not much lower than in the Czech Repub-\nlic), Lotz & Danskin (2017)have demonstrated the existence\nof a linear relationship between the sum of induced electric\nﬁelds recorded in the ground during geomagnetic storms and\nthe integral of SYM-H (or Dst) values, suggesting that the\ncumulative SYM-H orDst could be used as good proxies for\ncumulated induced electricﬁelds at middle corrected geomag-\nnetic latitudes (although ring current effects are likely more\nimportant for GICs in South Africa than in the Czech Republic,\nwhere a more balanced mixture of ring current and substorm\neffects is present). They also noted that some effects might be\npresent as long as SYM-H remained below/C0 20 nT.\nTherefore, we also consider theIntDst parameter to catego-\nrize disturbed days of expected signiﬁcant GICs in the Czech\nRepublic (e.g., seeMourenas et al., 2018). IntDst (in nT hr) is\ncalculated as a sum of hourly |Dst| values. This summation starts\nwhen Dst ﬁrst becomes smaller than a threshold (taken between\n/C0 50 nT and/C0 25 nT as before) chosen to ensure that only storm\nperiods are considered, and this summation ends whenDst\nreaches its minimum value over the next 24 h. EachIntDst\nvalue is then assigned to the starting day of a given summation,\nwith all integration periods strictly separated by construction.\nAs a result, IntDst is generally measured during storm main\nphase, where the effects on GICs are likely stronger (Balan\net al., 2014,\n2016), to provide a complementary metric to the\nInt(d(SYM-H)/dt) metric calculated over each whole day with-\nout any consideration of storm phase.\nWhile ring current variations during storms can be quanti-\nﬁed byDst and SYM-H indices, the magnetic indices that pro-\nvide a measure of magnetospheric and ionospheric current\nvariations observed during strong substorms areAE, AL, Kp,\nor ap (Mayaud, 1980; Kamide & Kokobun, 1996; Thomsen,\n2004; Mourenas et al., 2020). Theap index (as its logarithmic\nequivalent Kp) provides a global measure of the range of mag-\nnetic ﬁeld variations at middle latitudes over 3-h time scales,\nobtained by averaging measurements from different mid-\nlatitude magnetometer stations spread in longitude (Mayaud,\n1980; Thomsen, 2004). In contrast, the range indicesAE and\nAL are measured at higher magnetic latitudes >60/C176inside the\nauroral region (Mayaud, 1980; Kamide & Rostoker, 2004),\nand AE saturates at high geomagnetic activityam > 150 (with\nam a mid-latitude index similar toap) because the auroral oval\nthen expands equatorward of the magnetometer stations\nmeasuring it (Thomsen, 2004; Lockwood et al., 2019). There-\nfore, ap is probably more appropriate thanAE for quantifying\nthe strength of time-integrated geomagnetic disturbances at mid-\ndle (sub-auroral) geomagnetic latitudes than AE (Thomsen,\n2004; Mourenas et al., 2020).\nAlthough ap cannot provide an accurate ranking or quantiﬁ-\ncation of the maximum dH/dt values reached during the most\ndisturbed events due to its intrinsic saturation atKp =9a n d\nits coarse 3-h time resolution, it may still provide rough esti-\nmates during less extreme events withKp /C24 3–7( Kappenman,\n2005). Therefore, it is worth examining whether some time-\nintegrated measure ofap could still be used to simply categorize\ndisturbed/quiet days of expected stronger occurrence/absence of\nGIC effects at middle latitudes, during a large series of medium\n(most frequent) to strong (more rare) time-integratedap events\nspread over 6–10 years.\nAccordingly, we shall consider inSection 4.3at h i r dp a r a m -\neter of geomagnetic activity,IntAp, corresponding to the daily\nmaximum level of the integral of 3-hourlyap values over a con-\ntinuously active period ofap /C21 15 nT (Mourenas et al., 2019,\n2020). This should allow to categorize disturbed days that\ninclude contributions to GICs from both (storm-time) ring\ncurrent variations and strong substorms, usefully complement-\ning theInt(d(SYM-H)/dt)a n dIntDst parameters. Indeed,IntAp\nprovides a rough estimate of the effects at middle latitudes of\nsigniﬁcant time-integrated dH/dt disturbances due to substorms,\nwhich often do not reach the low latitudes where SYM-H and\nDst are measured.\nIn addition, we shall consider a fourth parameter, called\nIntAE, which is based on the high-latitudeAE auroral electrojet\nindex Mayaud (1980). IntAE is the daily maximum level of\nthe integral ofAE calculated over the same period of continu-\nously high ap /C21 15 nT asIntAp (generally corresponding to\nAE > 200 nT), to ensure that the corresponding substorm-related\nmagnetic disturbances effectively reach middle latitudes\n(Mourenas et al., 2019, 2020). IntAE provides a measure of\nM. Švanda et al.: J. Space Weather Space Clim. 2020,10,2 6\nPage 4 of 31\ncumulative substorm-related disturbances, corresponding to\ncontinuous periods of auroral current variations roughly similar\nto High-Intensity Long-Duration Continuous AE Activity\n(HILDCAA) events (Tsurutani et al., 2006).\nThese four cumulative metrics of disturbed days are dis-\nplayed inFigure 1together with 1-min SYM-H andAE, hourly\nDst,a n d3 - h o u r l yap, during a moderate geomagnetic storm on\n14–15 February 2011 that reached a minimum SYM-H =\n/C0 49 nT and a minimumDst = /C0 40 nT on 14 February, with\nstrong substorms (identiﬁed by peaks in AE and ap) during\nstorm sudden commencement and main phase, and with a\nvery weak secondary minimum ofDst reaching /C0 30 nT on\n15 February at 17 UT during a burst ofAE activity.\n3 Methods\nIn the present follow-up study to the work byVýbošt’oková\n& Švanda (2019), we search for a tighter relationship between\npower grid anomalies and geomagnetic storms, based on the\nsame datasets of anomalies in the Czech power grid. We also\naddress the important and as yet unanswered question of the\ntime delay between geomagnetic events and the occurrences\nof anomalies.\nOur working hypothesis is that disturbed days of high\ngeomagnetic activity should cause an increase in daily rates\nof anomalies in the power distribution network as compared\nwith quiet days. Accordingly, the daily anomaly rates should\nsharply peak within a few days (with some delay) after such dis-\nturbed days, and then decrease back to normal levels. This cor-\nresponds to a rapid response to GICs induced by substorms and\nstorms, as observed for a few selected events– e.g., seeGil et al.\n(2019); Wang et al. (2015).\nUnfortunately, in a mid-latitude country such as the Czech\nRepublic, the effects of geomagnetic activity are expected to\nbe weak. Consequently, an investigation of individual, moderate\ngeomagnetic events is not expected to reveal a signiﬁcant\nincrease of anomalies, because such anomalies induced by\ngeomagnetic activity (via GICs) will generally remain hidden\namong many other anomalies caused by various other effects.\nIt is therefore imperative in our statistical analysis toﬁnd a\nway to reduce the importance of anomalies caused by other\neffects. Note that our data series cover 6–10 years, each subset\nproviding records of anomaly rates occurring during many\nseparated disturbed days of high geomagnetic activity. There-\nfore, a feasible approach is to average over all these different\nevents. The corresponding methodology is the Superposed\nEpoch Analysis, widely used in astrophysics.\nA Superposed Epoch Analysis (SEA;Chree, 1913)i sa\nstatistical technique used to reveal either periodicities within a\ntime sequence, or toﬁnd a correlation between two time series.\nIn the later case, the method proceeds in several steps.\n1. In the reference time series, occurrences of the repeated\nevents are deﬁned as key times (or epochs).\n2. Subsets are extracted from the second time series within\nsome range around each key time.\n3. Subsets from each time series are superposed, synchro-\nnized at the same key time (Day 0), and averaged, allow-\ning inter-comparisons.\nThis methodology is known to efﬁciently enhance the\n“signal” (related variations in both series) with respect to\n“noise” (unrelated variations in both series), because the noise\nadds up incoherently, whereas the signal is reinforced by the\nsuperposition.\nThus, we performed the SEA of geomagnetic activity\ndeﬁned byInt(d(SYM-H)/dt)o r IntDst parameters. A range of\nevent thresholds SYM-H (orDst)< /C0 25 nT to/C0 50 nT was\nconsidered, to keep only periods corresponding to weak to large\ngeomagnetic storms (Gonzalez et al., 1994) and to allow for the\ndetermination of the best thresholds on event strength. Other\ndays were assigned a zero level ofInt\n(d(SYM-H)/dt)o rIntDst.\nAn important further requirement was that the 5-day period\nimmediately preceding the start of a geomagnetic storm (Day\n0 in the SEA) contained a zero level of the considered geomag-\nnetic activity parameter (that is, all such quiet days must have\nIntDst =0o r Int(d(SYM-H)/dt) = 0). This rather strict constraint\nshould allow to better quantify the effect of geomagnetic storms\non the power grid duringdisturbed daysas compared withquiet\ndays, at the expense of a slight reduction of the number of\nconsidered events. In a second step, we analyzed in more details\nthese SEAs to determine as accurately as possible the time delay\n(after the start of a storm) that corresponds to the statistically\nmost signiﬁcant increase of anomalies, for each type of power\ngrid equipment.\n4 Results of superposed epoch analysis\nA Superposed Epoch Analysis was performed based on\nIntDst and Int(d(SYM-H)/dt) parameters, considering succes-\nsively thresholds Dst < /C0 25 nT, /C0 30 nT, /C0 40 nT, and\n/C0 50 nT, or SYM-H < /C0 25 nT, /C0 30 nT, /C0 40 nT, and\n/C0 50 nT, to explore the dependence of power grid anomalies\non the minimum strength of geomagnetic storms.

Figure 2 shows the SEAs obtained for the D12 series\n(power lines). Similar trends are found for other datasets con-\ncerning power lines. All theﬁgures corresponding to the differ-\nent series D1–D12 are available in the Appendix asFigures\nA.1–A.12.\n4.1 Storm effects: 5-day periods after/before day 0\nNext, we compared the period of 5disturbed daysimmedi-\nately following Day 0 (the day of peak storm activity) with the\n5-day period immediately preceding Day 0– a preceding period\nof quiet days especially selected to have zero IntDst or\nInt(d(SYM-H)/dt) levels. This allows to directly check the\nimpact ofdisturbed daysof geomagnetic storms on power grid\nanomalies, as compared withquiet days. For the two time inter-\nvals, we summed the total number of registered anomalies in the\nsuperposed series for each data subset and computed the statis-\ntical signiﬁcance of the differences using the standard binomial\nstatistical test. We tested the null hypothesis that the number of\nanomalies recorded over quiet days is not different from the\nnumber of anomalies recorded over disturbed days, that is, the\nnull hypothesis that the probability of recording anomalies is\nthe same during quiet and disturbed days. Should the resulting\np-value be smaller than the selected statistical threshold (usually\n0.05 for single-bin tests), we reject the null hypothesis, thereby\nsaying that the recorded differences are indeed statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\nThe results, summarized inTable 3, reveal a clear increase\nof anomalies during the period of 5disturbed daysfollowing\nDay 0 as compared with the period of 5quiet dayspreceding\nDay 0, for the two series D11 and D12 corresponding to power\nlines. The number of anomalies increases by 5% for D12 and by\n30% for D11, with correspondingp-values always statistically\nsigniﬁcant (<0.05), for thresholds </C0 30 nT or </C0 40 nT –\nexcept forInt(d(SYM-H)/dt) and D11 for a threshold </C0 30 nT.\nLower or higher thresholds usually lead to less statistically sig-\nniﬁcant increases of anomalies, although not always– e.g. for\nD11 andIntDst,t h e</C0 25 nT threshold gives a higher statisti-\ncal signiﬁcance. This means that moderate events with mini-\nmum Dst or SYM-H near /C0 40 nT have often a statistically\ndetectable impact on anomaly rates, whereas weaker events\ndo not. The same thresholds also lead to the highest peaks of\nanomalies after Day 0 in many other series. Finally, for D11\nand D12, the </C0 40 nT thresholds lead to the smallestp-values\n(< 0.01) for bothIntDst and Int(d(SYM-H)/dt), as well as to\nthe smallest p-values < 0.1–0.2 for D8 and D10 when con-\nsidering\nIntDst, and to the smallest or second smallest\np-values < 0.2–0.36 for D2 and D9 when considering Int\n(d(SYM-H)/dt). Therefore, the thresholds SYM-H </C0 40 nT\nand Dst < /C0 40 nT are probably the most appropriate to detect\nstatistically signiﬁcant increases of anomalies related to geo-\nmagnetic storms.\nThe weaker signi ﬁcance of results for higher thresh-\nolds </C0 25 nT agrees with previous observations fromLotz &\nDanskin (2017)that weaker events have little effects on induced\nelectric ﬁelds. However, moderateDst or SYM-H geomagnetic\ndisturbances in the range/C0 40 nT to/C0 50 nT are found to still\nhave some impact on power lines. The weaker signiﬁcance of\nresults for lower thresholds </C0 50 nT is likely due to a combi-\nnation of two different effects: (i) storms start slightly later when\nusing a threshold </C0 50 nT than for higher thresholds </C0 40 nT\nor </C0 30 nT, meaning that the 5-day period preceding Day 0 can\nactually contain signiﬁcant dH/dt geomagnetic activity leading\nto some anomalies, and (ii) the </C0 50 nT threshold corresponds\nto a 30%–40% smaller number of events than the </C0 30 nT\nthreshold, decreasing the sensibility of the SEA to a potential\nslight increase of anomalies due to storms.\nA detailed inspection of the SEAs of D12 lends further cre-\ndence to the impact of geomagnetic storms on power lines.\nIndeed, for both IntDst and Int(d(SYM-H)/dt), the peaks of\nanomalies in the few days following Day 0 reach the high-\nest daily levels of anomalies of the whole 21-day SEAs\nfor < /C0 30 nT to </C0 50 nT thresholds, the main increases of\nanomalies occurring from Day +0 to Day +3. The 4-day period\npreceding Day 0 also contains less anomalies than other periods.\nFor D11 and thresholds </C0 30 nT to </C0 40 nT, the 4-day period\nfollowing Day 0 has also the highest number of anomalies of the\nwhole 21-day SEA, while the 5-day interval preceding Day 0 has\nthe lowest average number of anomalies of the whole SEA.\n4.2 Storm effects: 3-day periods before/after\nday 0 with time lags\nNext, we examined in more details the SEAs performed\nbased onIntDst and Int(d(SYM-H)/dt) parameters for thresholds\nDst < /C0 40 nT and SYM-H </C0 40 nT. We considered two\nshorter 3-day periods, located before and after Day 0. We varied\nthe time lag between them and calculated (as before for 5-day\nperiods) the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference in anomaly\nrates between these two periods. Considering shorter 3-day peri-\nods should help to determine more precisely the (statistically\nmost signiﬁcant) time delay between the start of a geomagnetic\nstorm and the related increase of the number of anomalies.\nFigure 3for D12,Figure 4for D8, andFigures A.13–A.24\nin the Appendix for all other datasets, show two-dimensional\nmaps of the increases (or decreases) of the number of anomalies\nas a function of the middle day of theﬁrst and second 3-day\nperiods, together with maps of the corresponding p-values\ncomputed only for increases.\nLet us examine these maps ofp-values.

Accordingly, we must only consider the bins (represent-\ning 3-day periods) comprised between Days/C0 4a n d/C0 2 (actu-\nally covering Days/C0 5t o/C0 1) for the period before Day 0, and\nthe bins comprised between Days +2 and +4 (actually covering\nDays +1 to +5) for the period following Day 0. There are\n3 /C2 3 = 9 such bins. Finding only one bin with a\np-value /C24 0.05 (corresponding to a 5% probability to obtain\nan increase of anomalies by chance) among 9 bins is not any-\nmore as statistically signiﬁcant as before. Therefore, an individ-\nual bin (representing 3-day periods) is hereafter required to have\nas m a l l e rp-value /C20 0.05/9 = 0.0055 to be considered statisti-\ncally signiﬁcant.\nIn the case of the D12 dataset (power lines), there are\nsix bins with p-values < 0.0055 for both IntDst and\nInt(d(SYM-H)/dt) in the considered square of 3/C2 3 bins cen-\ntered on (/C0 3, +3) inFigure 3, corresponding to a statistically\nsigniﬁcant increase of anomalies. A signiﬁcant increase of\nanomalies is already observed overﬁnal 3-day periods centered\non Day +1, as compared with initial 3-day periods centered on\nDays /C0 3a n d/C0 2, indicating an immediate effect of geomag-\nnetic storms on power lines.\nIn the case of D8 (transformers), however, the three bins\ncorresponding to increases of anomalies with the smallest\np-values are found inFigure 4for ﬁnal 3-day periods centered\non Days +3 to +4, as compared with initial 3-day periods\ncentered on Days /C0 1 to 0. Therefore, there is a clear time\ndelay of /C24 2–3 days between a variation of IntDst or\nInt(d(SYM-H)/dt) and the corresponding variation of the num-\nber of anomalies in the D8 dataset. In such a situation, it is more\nappropriate to consider for D8 the square of 3/C2 3=9b i n sc e n -\ntered on (/C0 1, +3) inFigure 3.

Some\nless signiﬁcant increases are also found for D4 (power lines\nas D11–D12) forIntDst. Such results imply an immediate effect\nof geomagnetic storms on power lines, already on Days 0 to +1.\nThis looks quite realistic, because any effect of GICs on power\nlines (due to harmonics-related current waveform distortion\nFig. 3.

Space Weather Space Clim. 2020,10,2 6\nPage 8 of 31\nleading to a detrimental reaction of protective relays or other\ndevices connected to these lines) is likely to occur almost\nimmediately.\nFurthermore, Figure 4reveals the presence of a statistically\nsigniﬁcant delayed increase of anomalies for D8 (high voltage\ntransformers) following geomagnetic storms when considering\nIntDst (an increase is also present forInt(d(SYM-H)/dt)b u t\nsomewhat less signiﬁcant), with a delay of/C24 3 days after Day\n0. This strongly suggests the presence of some delayed effects\nof storm-time geomagnetic activity on transformers (note also\nthat the lowest rates of anomalies are observed here on Days\n/C0 2 to 0, similarly corresponding to a delayed effect of the\nprevious days of zero storm activity). Transformers may indeed\nbe affected by GICs but still continue to operate for a while–\ntypically for a few days– before actual problems ultimately\nshow up and are registered in logs (e.g.,Wang et al., 2015).\n4.3 Ring and auroral currents effects: IntAp parameter\nSince both ring current variations during storms and other\n(mainly auroral) current variations during strong substorms\nmay produce signiﬁcant GICs, we further performed similar\nSEAs for theIntAp parameter, which (despite its own limitations,\nsee Sect. 2.2and Kappenman, 2005) is expected to roughly take\ninto account the effects of both kinds of disturbances– whereas\nIntDst and Int(d(SYM-H)/dt) only correspond to storm periods.\nHowever, due to the relatively low thresholdap /C21 15 (equivalent\nto Kp /C21 3) of integration used to calculate dailyIntAp levels, this\nnew data series contained many more events (notably, many\nisolated substorms, sometimes outside of storms) than the previ-\nous IntDst (storm) data set. As a result, requiring as before a\n5-day period prior to events withIntAp =0l e dt oo n l yaw e a k\nIntAp maximum on Day 0, with a precedingIntAp peak on Days\n/C0 10 to /C0 5 of comparable magnitude. Therefore, we changed\nour selection procedure, to consider only events with a peak\nIntAp > 1000 nT hr and such that no similar event was present\nin the preceding 5 days.\nThe resulting SEAs displayed inFigure 5show that this new\nselection procedure produces a large peakIntAp /C24 1400 nT hr\non Day 0 in the SEAs, with much lower levels on all 10 previous\ndays, especially between Days/C0 6a n d/C0 2. The daily number of\nanomalies is found to increase by a statistically very signiﬁcant\namount during the 5-day period following Day 0 as compared\nto the 5-day period preceding Day 0, for series D11 and D12\nin Figure 5, with correspondingp-values 0.03 and 0.007, respec-\ntively. There is a remarkable simultaneity between the peak of\nIntAp and the peak of anomalies in the two SEAs with at most\none day of delay. Moreover, such peaks of daily anomalies on\nDays 0 or +1 are consistently larger than all other daily values\nin the full 21-days SEAs. Such results therefore demonstrate\nFig. 4.

Note the logarithmic scale of the plottedp-values: p = 0.0055\n(the adopted level of statistical signiﬁcance for individual bins) corresponds to logp = /C0 2.26.

Space Weather Space Clim. 2020,10,2 6\nPage 9 of 31\nthe likely presence of nearly immediate effects of both storm-\nrelated and substorm-related geomagnetic disturbances on GICs\nand power lines (D11–D12) in the Czech power network. This is\ncertainly due to the major impact of strong substorms on GICs,\nboth during and outside geomagnetic storms.\nThere are also detectable increases of daily anomalies\nbetween 5-day periods before/after Day 0 for D8 (transformers,\nwith a delay of/C24 2 days) and for D4 (power lines, immediate),\nbut they are not statistically signiﬁcant, with p-values ’ 0.25\n(see SEAs for all D1–D12 series provided inFigs. A.25–A.36\nin the Appendix).\nBesides, there is a statistically signiﬁcant increase of anoma-\nlies for D10 (high and very high voltage electrical substations)\nwith ap-value of 0.006, with aﬁrst peak of anomalies at Day +1\nbut a much delayed higher peak on Days +4 and +5. While\npower lines react immediately to GICs, high and very high\nvoltage electrical substations, which comprise busbars, capaci-\ntors, or transformers, may indeed be affected but still continue\nto operate without registered problems until the cumulative\ndamage reaches a sufﬁcient level. A time lag of 3–5 days does\nnot seem wholly unrealistic in this respect (Kappenman, 2007;\nWang et al., 2015).\nIt is worth noting that our previous analysis based onIntDst\ndid not show a statistically signiﬁcant impact of storms for D10\n(although the smallestp-value reached 0.08 inTab. 3), contrary\nto the present analysis based onIntAp. This suggests that pro-\nlonged 2–3 day periods of repeated non-storm-time substorms\nor solar wind sudden impulses (SIs), taken into account by\nIntAp but not byIntDst, could have a noticeable effect on some\nelectrical substations.\n4.4 Auroral current effects: IntAE parameter\nNext, we performed similar SEAs for theIntAE parameter\nthat provides a measure of cumulated high-latitude auroral\ncurrent variations. An increased hourly auroral electrojet index\nAE >1 5 0–250 nT is one of the dominant manifestations of\nsubstorms, and many substorm studies rely onAE to estimate\nthe intensity of substorms, althoughAE is not a speciﬁc measure\nof substorms (Kamide & Kokobun, 1996; Tsurutani et al.,\n2004). We compared the period of 5disturbed days(with daily\nIntAE > 150 nT hr) immediately following Day 0 (the day of\npeak IntAE) with the 5-day period immediately preceding\nDay 0 – a preceding period ofnearly quiet days(with daily\nIntAE < 30 nT hr) especially selected to have such nearly zero\nIntAE levels. This way, we can check the impact ofdisturbed\ndays of strong AE activity (often corresponding to substorms,\noccurring both during and outside storms) on power grid\nanomalies, as compared withquiet days. We also tried as before\nto consider shorter 3-day periods to help determine the best time\nlags between increases of anomalies and Day 0.\nAll the corresponding plots are given inFigures A.37–A.48\nin the Appendix. In general, these results mostly agree with the\nIntAp results. However, they are somewhat less statistically sig-\nniﬁcant than the results obtained with all the preceding metrics,\nexcept for the D11–D12 (power lines) series. For D11, weﬁnd a\nstatistically signiﬁcant 15% increase in the total number of\nanomalies after/before Day 0, with ap-value of 0.034 (see\nFig. 6), while for D12 (power lines) the increase of anomalies\nis only 2.6%, with a barely signiﬁcant p = 0.055.\nAn important point is that these results based onIntAE\nconﬁrm the impact on power lines of auroral electrojet distur-\nbances, often related to substorms. Nevertheless, these results\nalso suggest that theIntDst, IntAp,o rInt(d(SYM-H)/dt)m e t r i c s\nmay be slightly more appropriate thanIntAE for categorizing\ndisturbed days leading to GIC effects at middle latitudes in\nthe Czech power grid. This could stem from the higher latitudes\nof stations measuringAE than for the mid-latitudeap index:\nIntAE may either take into account weak substorms that actually\ndo not strongly affect middle latitudes, or it may under-estimate\nmid-latitude disturbances produced by large substorms\n(Thomsen, 2004; Lockwood et al., 2019). Alternatively, there\ncould be some signiﬁcant impacts of ring current variations\non GICs at mid-latitudes, not taken into account inIntAE.\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n 60\n 70\n-10 -5  0  5  10\nAnomalies per day\nDays from epoch\n 0\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n 1000\n 1200\n 1400\n-10 -5  0  5  10\nAverage intAP\nDays from epoch\n 650\n 700\n 750\n 800\n 850\n 900\n 950\n 1000\n 1050\n-10 -5  0  5  10\nAnomalies per day\nDays from epoch\n 0\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n 1000\n 1200\n 1400\n-10 -5  0  5  10\nAverage intAP\nDays from epoch\nFig. 5.

Space Weather Space Clim. 2020,10,2 6\nPage 10 of 31\n5 Discussion\nIn the SEAs, roughly/C25 5–10% increases of the number of\nanomalies were often observed during theﬁve most disturbed\ndays as compared with the precedingﬁve consecutive quiet\ndays. However, it is important to note that such increases of\nanomalies were present during only theﬁve most disturbed days\namong the 21-day total duration of each SEA. It is also unclear if\nthere was any statistically signiﬁcant increase of anomalies\ncaused by the much weaker geomagnetic activity present during\nother days that did not fulﬁll the criteria for our SEA analysis. It\nis thus difﬁcult to obtain a credible estimate of the total fraction\nof anomalies that could be directly related to geomagnetic\neffects. In our previous study ( Výbošt’oková & Švanda,\n2019), the corresponding total number of anomalies attributable\nto variations of geomagnetic activity was estimated as 1–4%.\nSuch values are consistent with results from a previous study\nof the impact of solar activity on the US electric power transmis-\nsion network in 1992–2010, which showed that/C24 4% of the\ncorresponding anomalies were likely attributable to strong\ngeomagnetic activity and GICs (Schrijver & Mitchell, 2013).\nWe also considered different parameter series, namely\ncumulative IntDst, IntAp,a n dIntAE parameters integrated over\nthe preceding 5 or 10 days, to evaluate the effects of a longer\nexposure to GICs on power-grid devices. The corresponding\nsuperposed epoch analysis did not yield statistically signiﬁcant\nresults. Without a proper event selection procedure and no\nintegration limit, the SEAs were dominated by weak events,\nduring which the effects were probably weak and did not\nemerge from the average rates of anomalies due to causes other\nthan geomagnetic activity. SEAs were further performed\nseparately for weak, moderate, and strong events, but this did\nnot signiﬁcantly improve the results. The most promising results\nin terms of magnitude of increase of anomalies during stronger\nactivity were for D8, D10, and D12 forIntDst (with lags of 1–3\ndays), and D8 and D11 forIntAE.\nBased on our analysis, it turns out that geomagnetic distur-\nbances affected mostly the datasets registering anomalies on\npower lines. It is interesting to note that most of the power lines\nin D7, D11, and D12 are the power lines with distances between\ngrounding points of the order of tens of kilometers. We also\nfound signiﬁcant delayed effects in the D8 dataset of high-\nvoltage transformers. Although signiﬁcant effects were observed\nin D4 during strong storms (see Fig. A.40), the distances\nbetween grounding points are of the order of hundreds of meters\nin this case, that is, much shorter than for the other power-line\ndatasets. The topology of the network in D4 is also far more\ncomplex than in the other power-line datasets. It is unlikely that\nGICs induced in the D4 network could be responsible for the\nobserved increase of anomaly rate after Day 0 in the correspond-\ning SEA. Nevertheless, some detrimental currents could have\nentered the D4 network from nearby connected networks of\nother power companies and caused operational anomalies during\nstrong events.\n6 Conclusions\nAs noted bySchrijver & Mitchell (2013), the selection of an\nappropriate geomagnetic parameter is very important when\nsearching for correlations between anomalies recorded in human\ninfrastructures and variations of geomagnetic activity. Here, we\nhave presented results obtained by considering four different\nand complementary parameters of cumulative geomagnetic\nactivity, namely the different storm-time Int(d(SYM-H)/dt)\nand IntDst low-latitude metrics tracking mainly ring current\nvariations, the high-latitudeIntAE metric mainly tracking auro-\nral current variations, and the mid-latitudeIntAp metric tracking\nboth ring and auroral current variations– all of which were inte-\ngrated over geomagnetically disturbed periods. This allowed us\nto compare the cumulated number of anomalies observed in the\nCzech power grid during the corresponding disturbed days of\nhigh geomagnetic activity with the number of anomalies\nrecorded during quiet days.\nAt the considered middle geomagnetic latitudes, our statisti-\ncal analysis of/C24 10 years of data has shown that space weather-\nrelated events affected mostly long power lines (D11, D12),\nprobably due to a distortion of the electrical current waveform\nthat eventually triggered a detrimental reaction of protective\nrelays or disrupted other connected devices. However, signiﬁ-\ncant and slightly more delayed (by/C24 1–2 days) effects were\nalso observed in high-voltage transformers.\nBoth substorm-related disturbances and magnetic storms\nwere found to have statistically signiﬁcant impacts on the power\ngrid network, since the four considered measures of disturbed\ndays (IntDst, Int(d(SYM-H)/dt), IntAp,a n dIntAE)l e dt om o r e\nor less similar results– although IntAE was slightly less efﬁ-\ncient. In addition, we found that considering moderate thresh-\nolds (neither too large nor too small) on time-integrated\ngeomagnetic activity quantiﬁed by IntDst, Int(d(SYM-H)/dt),\nor IntAp, produced the most statistically signiﬁcant increases\n 50\n 60\n 70\n 80\n 90\n 100\n 110\n 120\n 130\n-10 -5  0  5  10\nAnomalies per day\nDays from epoch\n 0\n 50\n 100\n 150\n 200\n 250\n 300\n-10 -5  0  5  10\nAverage intAE\nDays from epoch\nFig. 6.

Solid lines indicate super-\nposed anomaly rates (upper panel) orIntAE (in nT h) in the reference\ntime series (lower panel) during Days/C0 1 to +5 from the epoch (Day\n0), whereas dashed lines show the same quantities for the remaining\ndays. Error bars show one-standard-deviation half-widths.\nM. Švanda et al.: J. Space Weather Space Clim. 2020,10,2 6\nPage 11 of 31\nin anomaly rates, suggesting a non-negligible impact of moder-\nate disturbances. These results are therefore consistent with a\nmajor impact of substorms, either inside or outside storms, on\nGICs at middle latitudes, together with a possible additional\nimpact of ring current variations during storms.\nIt is worth noting that our study showed that in the 5-day\nperiod following the commencement of geomagnetic activity\nthere is an approximately 5–10% increase in the recorded power\nline and transformers anomalies in the Czech power grid,\nprobably related to geomagnetic activity and GICs. Such values\nare consistent with previous results concerning the US power\ngrid (Schrijver & Mitchell, 2013). Schrijver et al. (2014)further\nfound that for the US network, the 5% stormiest days were\napparently the most dangerous, with a 20% increase of grid-\nrelated anomalies as compared to quiet periods. We similarly\nfound that the days with a minimumDst < /C0 50 nT (roughly\nrepresenting the /C25 8% stormiest days, see Gonzalez et al.,\n1994) had probably the strongest impact in the Czech power\ngrid, leading to immediate or slightly delayed/C24 5 /C0 20%\nincreases of anomalies as compared to quiet periods.\nAcknowledgements.
