However, as such representations are\nlearned from general domain distributions, their\n*Equal contribution.\n†Correspondence to: jiangwenbin@baidu.com\ngeneralization performance are deteriorate on spe-\ncialized domains where distribution are much more\ndifferent, such as biomedicine, science, legal, etc.\nMany works thus trying to construct domain-\nspeciﬁc PLMs either from scratch or initialized\nfrom the original PLM, such as BioBERT (Lee\net al., 2020), LegalBERT (Chalkidis et al., 2020),\nSciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019), etc. Through the\npretraining procedure, domain-speciﬁc knowledge\nare memorized and internalized into the parame-\nter of the PLMs, thus providing a better initializa-\ntion point for learning downstream tasks. How-\never, such attempts not only consume much more\ncosts, as it requires considerable computation to\npretrain a language model, but also can not cover\nadaptive needs at task- or even instance-level gran-\nularity, as domain-speciﬁc PLMs are preliminarily\ntrained with a ﬁxed scale domain corpora but ap-\nplied for all domain tasks. In fact, domain can be\ndeﬁned at various granularity w.r.t. various appli-\ncations (Chronopoulou et al., 2022). For example,\nin the biomedical domain, texts might distribute\nacross academic publication, medical record or\nmedical-situated dialog, and exhibit completely dif-\nferent style and background knowledge.\nIn this paper, we novelly propose a Retrieval-\nAugmented framework for Domain Adaptation\n(RADA) to address the above challenges. Instead\nof internalizing a ﬁxed corpora into PLM param-\neters via further pretraining, we construct and re-\ntrieve a datastore to dynamically enhance the learn-\ning of domain-speciﬁc downstream tasks. The ﬂex-\nibility of such a retrieval-augmented framework is\nin two-fold: 1) On one hand, we no longer need\nto maintain multiple PLMs respectively for each\napplication domains, all domains simply share the\nsame checkpoint for initialization but with domain-\nspecialized datastore. 2) On the other hand, the\ndatastore only consists of most relevant background\npassages tailored for each speciﬁc task. Such task-\nlevel granularity provides best trade-off between\n54\nGeneralDomainPLM\nDomainAPLMDomainBPLMDomainCPLM\nDomainACorpusDomainBCorpusDomainCCorpus GeneralDomainPLM DomainBCorpusDomainACorpusDomainCCorpus\nDomainATaskDomainBTaskDomainCTask\nDomainATaskDomainBTaskDomainCTask\n(a)FurtherPretrainedDA (b)Retrieval-BasedDA\nFigure 1: Illustration of the motivated retrieval-augmented framework for language model domain adaptation.\nscale and coverage, we either do not need to collect\na very large corpora in order to effectively cover all\nsub-domains, nor concerned with its coverage for\nthis speciﬁc task. The illustration of the motivated\nframework compared to existing further pretraining\nsolution is given in Figure 1.\nThe core component of such a retrieval-\naugmented framework remains how to effectively\nintegrate the retrieved passages. One line of related\nworks is knowledge-enhanced PLMs (Zhang et al.,\n2019; Peters et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020), they\nmostly resort to attention mechanism to directly\nincorporate the matched knowledge triples. Differ-\nently, we consider textual domain corpus instead of\nstructured knowledge in this paper as the latter only\nhas very limited coverage, especially for domain\nspecialized scenarios. As a consequence, we aim to\nintegrate retrieved passages that are less knowledge-\nintensive and might be mixed with noisy informa-\ntion that are irrelevant to solve the task. We ac-\ncordingly propose a two-level selection scheme:\npassage-level selection and word-level selection.\nAmong the multiple retrieved passages given by a\ncoarse-grained but efﬁcient retriever, we ﬁrst pro-\npose a differentiable sampling module that enables\nthe model to dynamically select the most helpful\nbackground passage. We then adopt an attention\nmechanism to weigh all words inside the selected\npassage to achieve more ﬁne-grained integration.\nThe retrieval-augmentation interface works as a\npluggable module that needs no further modiﬁca-\ntion of the main encoding pipeline.\nWe conduct experiments on 7 popular tasks cov-\nering three different downstream domains and a\nwide range of task variety. The results and abla-\ntions demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage\nof the proposed framework. The contribution of\nthis paper is three-fold:\n• Conceptual Contribution We novelly pro-\npose a retrieval-augmented framework for\ndomain-adaptation of PLMs. The framework\nis designed as a pluggable module, which not\nonly saves the costs to construct and maintain\nspecialized PLMs for each respective domain,\nbut also provides domain specialty at ﬂexible\ntask-level granularity with no concern of the\ntrade-off between domain scale and coverage.\n• Technical Contribution We propose a two-\nlevel selection scheme to achieve ﬁne-grained\nintegration of retrieved passages while al-\nleviate noise distraction. Speciﬁcally, we\nintroduce a differentiable sampling module\nfor passage-level selection and an attention\nmechanism to further assign word-level im-\nportance.\n• Experimental Contribution We achieve con-\nsistent improvements across different domains\nincluding Science, Biomedicine and Legal.\nWhen combined with further pretraining, the\nimprovements of the proposed framework are\nmuch more signiﬁcant, surpassing competi-\ntive baseline of vanilla further pretraining.\n2 Related Work\nDomain Adaptation (Ramponi and Plank, 2020) is\nan important and widely investigated problem in\nthe area of NLP. In the current pretrain-ﬁnetune\nparadigm, it becomes even more practical as\nmost of NLP systems start with a general-purpose\nPLM but applied into various downstream scenar-\nios (Guo and Yu, 2022). Many early works have\nfound that continued pretraining of PLM on domain\nspeciﬁc corpus could bring beneﬁts (Alsentzer\net al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020). Gururangan et al.\n(2020) take a step further to systematically inves-\ntigate the effect of further pretraining on multiple\ndomains, which they refer to as domain-adaptive\n55\nPLM PLM\nTa s kInput\nRetrievalAugmentationInterface\nDomainCorpus\nCross-AttentionCross-Attention\nAggregate\n⨁\nGumbelSoftmaxGradientApproximation\n𝑄 𝐾&𝑉 𝐾&𝑉\nShared\nPost-Norm\nRA-Interface\n0.120.400.31\n0.120.400.310.250.100.22\nPassage-levelselection\nword-levelselection\nPassageA PassageB\nRetriever𝑥!,𝑥\",…,𝑥#,…,𝑥$\nAdaptedRepresentation\nFigure 2: The overall retrieval-augmented framework of RADA.

Besides, they also propose\ntask-adaptive pretraining (TAPT) to perform fur-\nther pretraining also on task data, which further\nbrings signiﬁcant improvements.\nThere are mainly two concerns for these further\npretraining based methods. One is the cost to con-\nstruct and maintain considerable number of PLMs\nfor each speciﬁc domain, which can be quite a lot\nspreading over various application scenarios. The\nother is the complication to formally deﬁne the\nconcept of domain because domains exhibit hierar-\nchical taxonomy in practical scenarios (Reid et al.,\n2022). The scope of a domain should neither be too\nbroad, which results in loss of domain specialty, nor\nbe too narrow, which results in loss of generaliza-\ntion ability. Many recent works (Chronopoulou\net al., 2022; Gururangan et al., 2022; Li et al.,\n2022) thus propose to incorporate multiple domains\ninto one shared model, and introduce mixture-of-\nexperts module to allow different sub-domains also\nshare with each other. By contrast, RADA takes\na very different retrieval-based road to resolve the\nabove concerns.\nSeveral other works also try to advance domain\nadaptation from various perspectives. For example,\nYu et al. (2021) studied DAPT for the speciﬁc task\nof abstractive summarization. Xu et al. (2021)\npropose gradual ﬁnetuning for domain adaptation.\nBai et al. (2021) investigates the trade-off between\nDAPT and data annotation under limited budget\nfor domain adaptation.\nAnother very related line of work is retrieval-\naugmented language models. kNN-LM (Khan-\ndelwal et al., 2020) retrieves for similar language\nmodeling probability distributions and interpolate\nthem with the current step of token generation.\nGuu et al. (2020) and Lee et al. (2019) propose\nto learn differentiable retriever to better select help-\nful passages. Lewis et al. (2020) propose a non-\nparametric retriever and combine it with a gen-\nerator model. Borgeaud et al. (2022) use atten-\ntion mechanism to integrate retrieved passages\nand also explore the datastore in a very large\nscale. Izacard et al. (2022) investigate the use-\nfulness of retrieval-augmentation in the context\nof few-shot prompting with LLMs. Although be-\ning technically related, most of these works focus\non general-purpose language understanding, espe-\ncially knowledge-intensive tasks. While in this\npaper, we focus on the challenge of LM domain\nadaptation, and also novelly propose a two-level se-\nlection scheme to further augment the framework.\n3 Methodology\nRADA is a general framework for task-agnostic do-\nmain adaptation, and can be readily integrated into\nthe standard pipeline of PLM deployment. In the\nfollowing section, we ﬁrst brief the construction of\ndomain specialized datastore in Section 3.1, and\nthe framework formulation in Section 3.2. We then\nintroduce the core component, a pluggable inter-\nface for retrieval-augmented domain adaptation in\nSection 3.3, and ﬁnally brief the training usage in\nSection 3.4. The overall framework is illustrated in\nFigure 2.\n56\n3.1 Datastore Construction\nWe consider textual domain corpus as a necessary\nrecipe to adapt a general-domain language model.\nFrom their related sources, we collect domain spe-\ncialized passages {pi}D, and refer to them as the\ndatastore. In practical implementation, we truncate\nthe length of each passage to 256 tokens for sim-\nplicity. We then build an Elasticsearch service†, for\nany task-speciﬁc training or test input sequence x,\nwe can retrieve for its Kmost relevant background\npassages {pk}K\nk=1. Although Elasticsearch only\nserves coarse-grained retrieving purpose, we can\nemploy it as an efﬁcient ﬁrst-stage retriever.\nFor each speciﬁc downstream task, the datastore\nis constructed at task-level granularity. And the re-\ntrieving of most relevant passages further achieves\ninstance-level granularity. This is in contrast with\nmany existing works where datastore is constructed\nand utilized at domain-level granularity, once a tar-\nget domain is determined, a ﬁxed-scale datastore\nis collected and injected into PLM as an integral\nthrough further pretraining. As a result, RADA\nbrings better ﬂexibility and save the difﬁculty to\ndeliberate the trade off between domain specialty\nand domain coverage.\n3.2 Retrieval-Augmented PLM\nIn a standard PLM-based framework, we ﬁrst take\nthe task input sequence x = {xi}and use the\npretrained encoder to produce contextualized rep-\nresentations:\nHx = encode(x) (1)\nwhere Hx ∈Rl∗d is the sequence level representa-\ntion for lwords and ddimensions. We accordingly\nrefer to hx\ni as the contextualized representation at\neach speciﬁc position i. The representations are\nthen fed into a task-tailored head module, such as\nclassiﬁcation, regression or sequence tagging, etc.\nIn RADA, accompanied with each task input, we\nsimilarly construct the representations for retrieved\npassages {pk}:\nHpk = encode(pk), 1 ≤k≤K (2)\nand we similarly get Hpk and hpk\nj . The purpose\nof the proposed RADA framework can be formu-\nlated as a universal interface that augments and\nupdates task representations hx\ni using Hpk, where\n†https://github.com/elastic/\nelasticsearch\nHpk serves as informative, relevant and domain-\nspecialized knowledge source:\n˜hi = RA-Interface(hx\ni ,{Hpk}K\nk=1) (3)\n˜hi is then unchangeably used in the rest of the\ntask pipeline. The overall framework remains task-\nagnostic and can be readily integrated into both\npretraining and ﬁnetuning stage. The interface can\nalso be easily extended to a more broad scenario\nwith different backbone networks other than Trans-\nformer.\n3.3 Retrieval Augmentation Interface\nWe elaborate the RA-Interface in this section.\nDifferent from many existing methods that resort to\nintegrate structured knowledge (Zhang et al., 2019;\nPeters et al., 2019), the retrieved textual domain\ncorpus are much less knowledge-intensive and thus\nmight contain irrelevant noise distractions. How-\never, Elasticsearch can only satisfy coarse-grained\nretrieving purpose, leaving it an important problem\nto effectively select and integrate actually helpful\ndomain knowledge.\nTo address such challenge, we propose a two-\nlevel selection scheme which performs discrete\nsampling at passage-level and attentively aggregate\nat word-level. Such selection strategy strengthens\nthe proposed interface with ﬁne-grained selection\ncapability to integrate helpful knowledge while ﬁl-\nter out its noisy parts. More speciﬁcally, we in-\ntroduce a gumbel sampling mechanism to select\nthe most helpful passage, along with an attention\nmechanism to assign distinguishable weights for\neach word insides the selected passage.\n3.3.1 Cross Attention\nIn order to cover both sequence-level and token-\nlevel downstream tasks, we would need to augment\nthe representation Hx at each speciﬁc position. For\nthe i-th token representation hxi, we calculate its\nrelevancy with respect to all other words from the\nretrieved passages using a canonical cross attention\nmechanism:\nqx\ni =WQhx\ni\nkpk\ni =WKhpk\nj\nvpk\ni =WV hpk\nj\n(4)\nαk\nij =\nqx\ni kpk\nj√\nd\n(5)\n57\nwhere αk\nij denotes the attentive weight of j-th to-\nken from passage pk for current position hx\ni . Intu-\nitively, this attentive weight can naturally measure\neach retrieved word its importance and relevance.\nTo represent the usefulness of passages and their\ntokens at integral sequence level, we simply sum-\nming over all task input positions:\nαk\nj =\n∑\ni\nαk\nij (6)\n3.3.2 Differentiable Sampling\nTo alleviate the noise distraction in the retrieved\npassages, we ﬁrst sample the most relevant pas-\nsage, then integrate all its words according to re-\nspective attentive weights. Intuitively, the sampling\noperation should be an argmax operation across all\ncandidate passages:\nαk =\n∑\nj\nαk\nj (7)\nˆk= argmax\nk∈{1,2,...,K}\nαk (8)\nNote that here we sum αk\nj up to αk only temporar-\nily for sampling most relevant passage, and will\nre-use αk\nj later in Equation 12 to aggregate repre-\nsentations. The passage level selection operation in\nEquation 8, although intuitive, is not differentiable,\nand are not allowed in an end-to-end trainable neu-\nral network. To enable such a learning-to-select\nability inside the proposed framework, we nov-\nelly introduce the Gumbel-Softmax estimator (Jang\net al., 2017) to replace Equation 8:\nβk = exp((αk + g)/τ)∑\nk exp((αk + g)/τ) (9)\nwhere gis the noise sampled from Gumbel distri-\nbution:\ng∼Gumbel(0,1) (10)\nThis is practically implemented as:\ng= −log(−log(u))\nwhere u∼Uniform(0,1) (11)\nThe resulting βdistributed over k∈{1,2,...,K }\nis an approximate categorical distribution when\nthe temperature τ approaches 0. We follow the\nStraight-Through procedure (Jang et al., 2017) to\ndiscretize βinto ˆkin the forward pass but use gum-\nbel approximation in the backward pass.\n3.3.3 Aggregation\nFor the selected passage ˆk, we apply a post-\nnormalization on the attentive weights:\n˜α\nˆk\nj =\nαˆk\nj\n∑\nj αˆk\nj\n,\n∑\nj\n˜α\nˆk\nj = 1 (12)\nWe then integrate the representations of passage ˆk\naccordingly:\nˆh=\n∑\nj\n˜α\nˆk\nj v\npˆk\nj (13)\nNote that in practical implementation, we use multi-\nhead attentions and concatenate all outputs together.\nWe then wrap ˆhwithin a residual connection and\nLayerNorm at each position ito produce the ﬁnal\noutput representation:\n˜hi = LayerNorm(Wˆh+ hx\ni ) (14)\nwhere W is another feedforward layer that merges\nrepresentations from multiple attention heads.\n3.4 Retrieval-Augmented Training\nThe proposed RA-Interface serves as a plug-\ngable module that interacts with the representations\nin-place. It is also end-to-end trainable and does\nnot modify the ﬁnal training objective. In practical\nusages, we can either directly apply such a retrieval-\naugmented framework in downstream ﬁnetuning,\nor ﬁrst adapt it with a domain-speciﬁc further pre-\ntraining stage. We investigate both settings in the\nexperiments.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Setup\nDataset We investigate the proposed framework\non a variety of domain-specialized downstream\ntasks.

Detailed\nstatistics are listed in Table 3.\nTraining For retrieval-augmented pretraining,\nwe split 10% from the entire domain corpus as\npretraining pretext task data while the rest 90% as\npretraining datastore. The pretraining steps are set\nto 10k for both DAPT and RADA. For retrieval-\naugmented ﬁnetuning, all corpus are considered as\ndatastore, but we only retrieval and keep the most\nrelevant passages for each task instances. In Elas-\nticSearch, we set the number of retrieved passages\nfor each input data as K = 10. For each task, we\nsearch batch size through {16,32}, learning rate\nthrough {1e−5,2e−5,5e−5}†, and set epoch\nto 10†. We also run with 3 different random seeds,\nand accordingly report the average and standard\ndeviation. We use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) as\nPLM for English tasks, and RoBERTa (Cui et al.,\n2020; Liu et al., 2019) for Chinese ones.\n4.2 Main Results\nTable 1 gives the main results for RADA. We can\nobserve two conclusions: 1) RADA outperforms\nstandard ﬁnetuning on 4 out of 7 selected tasks;\n2) When combined with further pretraining, the\nproposed framework is further improved, signiﬁ-\ncantly surpassing standard ﬁnetuning and DAPT.\nSpeciﬁcally the absolute beneﬁts over FT baseline\nare +1.59.\nWe further investigate a low-resource setting by\nsubsampling 30% of the training set. This is a very\npractical scenario as we often need to deal with\ndomain tasks at a relatively low annotation cost.\nResults in Table 2 also demonstrate the effective-\nness of the proposed framework in such settings.\nOn 6 out of 7 tasks, RADA achieves the best per-\nformance.\n4.3 Ablations\nWe investigate the impact of various components\nin this section.\n†For CMeIE, we search for {1e-5, 2e-5}.\n†For CMeIE and CMeEE, we set to 35 and 15 respectively.\n59\nDomain Biomedical Science Legal Avg.\nMethod QIC QQR CMeEE CMeIE SCI ARC SCM\nFT 81.860.07 81.970.81 65.450.07 61.310.20 81.391.03 68.332.05 68.970.21 72.75\nRADA w/ Top 1 82.310.25 82.560.43 66.080.26 61.480.05 81.780.25 74.150.96 69.140.26 73.93\nRADA w/ DS 82.450.10 82.750.67 66.000.20 61.530.24 82.070.86 75.421.48 70.250.32 74.34\nTable 5: Effects of Differentiable Sampling (DS).

Full means extra domain corpus are used.\n4.3.1 Scale of Datastore Corpus\nOne essential component of the proposed frame-\nwork is the datastore. We ﬁrst look into the effects\nof its scale. At pretraining stage, we ﬁx the pretrain-\ning steps to 5,000, and accordingly set the scale\nof datastore to 128, 256, 512 and 1024. The re-\nsults are illustrated in Figure 3. We observe clear\ntrends of increasing performance w.r.t. increased\ndatastore scale. As a consequence, the proposed\nRADA framework can always beneﬁt from a larger\ndatastore.\n4.3.2 Training Data as Datastore\nWe further investigate the feasibility of directly\nusing downstream task data as datastore corpus.\nAs previous study has demonstrated, training data\nitself can also provide useful background informa-\ntion to an extent (Wang et al., 2022). Similarly, Gu-\nrurangan et al. (2020) have also used task training\ndata to perform further pretraining, which they re-\nferred to as TAPT. In Table 6, we provide the results\nwhen using training data in the proposed retrieval-\naugmented framework, and also reproduce TAPT\nfor more comprehensive comparison. The results\nshow that both TAPT and RADA with Trainset\ncan provide considerable beneﬁts, but are outper-\nformed by RADA (full). As for these two methods,\nthey perform comparably on the investigated three\ndatasets. We also ﬁnd that training data is more use-\nful in sentence-level tasks (as included in the table),\nbut less helpful in other tasks such as classiﬁcation,\nsequence tagging, etc.\nFigure 3: Ablation on scale of corpus.\nFigure 4: Ablation on pretraining steps.\n4.3.3 Pretraining Steps\nWe have equipped RADA with a further pretraining\nstage with domain specialized data, and proved it to\nbe very effective in Table 1. In Figure 4, we further\nablate the effects of pretraining steps. We save and\nevaluate the intermediate checkpoint at respectively\n2.5k, 5k and 7.5k pretraining steps. The results ex-\nhibit clear trends that with more pretraining steps,\nRADA continually brings better adaptation perfor-\nmance.\n4.3.4 Differentiable Sampling\nOne key design of RADA is the two-level selection\nscheme. Speciﬁcally, the differentiable sampling\nmodule based on Gumbel Sampling trick enables\nthe model to dynamically learn which passage to\nintegrate. In Table 5 we investigate this choice\nof design. We provide an alternative baseline,\nwhere instead of learning to sample, we simply\nsum the cross attention weights over all positions\nas passage-level score, and select the maximum one\nto integrate into the retrieval-augmented interface.\nWe refer to this as Top 1 selection strategy. The\nresults show that both methods can bring improve-\n60\n•InputTe x t :This formalism is both elementary and powerful enough to strongly simulate many grammar formalisms, such as rewriting systems, dependency grammars , TAG , HPSG and LFG .•RelationLabel:HYPONYM-OF SamplingScore𝛽!\nRetrievedPassages(ESTo p10)\n1…Although we have presented supertaggingin the context of LTAG, it is applicable to other lexicalized grammar formalismssuch as CCG (Steedrnan1997), HPSG(Pollard and Sag 1987) , and LFG(Kaplan and Bresnan 1983)… 0.0992\n2Scrambling in German poses a problem for most grammar formalisms.

Measured using a single\nRTX TITAN GPU.\nments, but the proposed differentiable sampling is\nmuch more effective.\n4.3.5 Efﬁciency Analysis\nOne potential concern for retrieval-augmented\nmethods is their efﬁciency. We therefore inves-\ntigate this factor in Table 7. We consider the infer-\nence efﬁciency at deployment time. For each task\ninput, we retrieve 10 background passages using\nElasticSearch, then compute and incorporate them\ninto the RA-Interface. Note that at deploy-\nment time, it is practical to encode and cache all\npassages from the datastore in advance, so we only\naccount for the time consumption starting from\nthe interface. The results show that, the retrieval-\naugmentation framework only brings acceptable\ntime increase. And the overall inference speed is\nmaintained at around 0.02 seconds per instance on\na production-level device.\n4.3.6 Qualitative Analysis\nWe provide qualitative analysis in Table 5. The\nexample is sampled from the SCI task, the target\nis to extract the relation between subject rewrit-\ning systemsand object grammar formalisms, i.e.,\nHYPONYM-OF. We can clearly see that elastic-\nsearch can only provide coarse-grained, shallow-\nsemantic retrieving capability based on keywords,\nsuch as grammar, formalisms, HPSG, etc.However,\nthe proposed differentiable sampling module can\nmore effectively identify the most helpful passage\nby reasoning over deep representations produced\nby shared encoders. From passage 2 with the high-\nest sampling score, we can indeed reason, under-\nstand and accordingly infer the actual relationship\nbetween the target entity pair.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper we propose a retrieval-augmented\nframework to novelly address the challenge of lan-\nguage model domain adaptation. We use domain\nspecialized corpus as datastore and retrieve from\nit for informative and helpful domain knowledge.\nThe key module of the framework is a retrieval-\naugmentation interface, where we design a two-\nlevel selection scheme to integrate the most rele-\nvant passage and its words while alleviating the\nnoise. The overall framework enables ﬂexible do-\nmain coverage and ﬁne-grained domain knowledge\nintegration. On a variety of downstream domains\nand tasks, we conduct comprehensive experiments\nand comparisons to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the motivated framework and its components.\nIn the future, we hope to further extend the frame-\nwork to more scaled large language models and\nalso more challenging few-shot prompting setting.\n61\nLimitation\nWe summarize two limitations which also serve as\npromising directions to be explored in our future\nwork. RADA framework only considers textual\ndomain corpus as the datastore, although this has\ngreatly improve the coverage of domain knowl-\nedge as texts are always relatively easy to collect.\nHowever, it is widely investigated that structured\nknowledge such as knowledge base can also serve\nsimilar purpose. And such resources are generally\nin higher quality and are easier to match. There-\nfore, it would be beneﬁting to further integrate such\nresources at certain scenario where KB is available.\nThe other limitation regards to the scale of the\nRADA implementation. As large language models\nhave becoming increasingly powerful, they have\ndemonstrated quite impressive capability in mem-\norizing and recalling a wide range of background\nknowledge existed in the massive corpora they have\nbeen pretrained on. This trends of development nat-\nurally raises question for the proposed framework:\nwill it still be beneﬁcial when scale up to LLMs?\nand on what kinds of scenario does it brings best\nimprovements? These are very important questions\nto answer, and we can certainly expect them to be\nexplored in future works.\nEthical Statement\nWe evaluate the proposed method on established\nand publicly available datasets. There is also no\nhuman evaluation involved. This paper is not con-\ncerned with the above ethical risks. When the pro-\nposed framework is deployed into domain speciﬁc\nproduction, the domain adapted language models\nmight express ethical-related outputs, but just as\nany other language models do (Weidinger et al.,\n2021), and should be treated with according tech-\nniques to eliminate ethical risks such as bias, stereo-\ntypes.\nReferences\nEmily Alsentzer, John Murphy, William Boag, Wei-\nHung Weng, Di Jindi, Tristan Naumann, and\nMatthew McDermott. 2019.
