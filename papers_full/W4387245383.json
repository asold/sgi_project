    "abstract": "Scientific machine learning (SciML) has advanced recently across many different areas in computational science and engineering. The objective is to integrate data and physics seamlessly without the need of employing elaborate and computationally taxing data assimilation schemes. However, preprocessing, problem formulation, code generation, postprocessing, and analysis are still time- consuming and may prevent SciML from wide applicability in industrial applications and in digital twin frameworks. Here, we integrate the various stages of SciML under the umbrella of ChatGPT, to formulate MyCrunchGPT, which plays the role of a conductor orchestrating the entire workflow of SciML based on simple prompts by the user. Specifically, we present two examples that demonstrate the potential use of MyCrunchGPT in optimizing airfoils in aerodynamics, and in obtaining flow fields in various geometries in interactive mode, with emphasis on the validation stage. To demonstrate the flow of the MyCrunchGPT, and create an infrastructure that can facilitate a broader vision, we built a web app based guided user interface, that includes options for a comprehensive summary report. The overall objective is to extend MyCrunchGPT to handle diverse problems in computational mechanics, design, optimization and controls, and general scientific computing tasks involved in SciML, hence using it as a research assistant tool but also as an educational tool. While here the examples focus on fluid mechanics, future versions will target solid mechanics and materials science, geophysics, systems biology, and bioinformatics.",
