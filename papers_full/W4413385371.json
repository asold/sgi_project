Radiology\ndepartments globally are facing increasing demands, making\nthe adoption of LLMs not just advantageous but inevitable.\nHowever, it is imperative that we also address critical\nconsiderations for the responsible deployment of these\npowerful tools into regular radiology work ﬂows (see\n►Fig. 1 for an overview of major clinical LLM use cases in\nradiology and their evaluation metrics).\nA fundamental consideration when deploying LLMs in\nclinical practice involves choosing appropriate deployment\nstrategies. While popular proprietary models such as GPT-4\ndemonstrate impressive clinical reasoning capabilities, reli-\nance on external cloud-based services inherently requires\nthe transfer of protected health information, often across\nnational borders, posing signiﬁcant privacy and regulatory\nchallenges. India’s recently enacted Digital Personal Data\nProtection (DPDP) Act, 2023, currently mandates explicit\nconsent for data storage and limits unregulated cross-border\ndata transfers. These provisions encourage strategies that\nretain radiology data within national boundaries, enhancing\nlegal safety and operational simplicity. Conversely, smaller,\ndomain-speciﬁc, locally hosted models,ﬁne-tuned with de-\nidentiﬁed data, present viable alternatives, offering compa-\nrable task-speciﬁc accuracy with reduced risks to patient\ndata privacy and improved compliance with stringent data\nprotection regulations which countries including India are\nincreasingly adopting.\n2\nAn equally important discussion is the necessityof seamless\nintegration of LLM outputs with existing radiology informa-\ntion systems and electronic health records. The anticipated\nefﬁciency gains with LLM-driven tools may be undermined if\nradiologists need to navigate between disconnected interfaces.\nThus, early and close collaboration between health care IT\nspecialists, LLM developers, and radiologists is essential to\nensure that LLM outputs are directly integrated into the\nexisting clinical reporting interfaces.\n3\nFurther complexity arises with the advent of agentic work-\nﬂows, in which LLMs autonomously perform multi-step clini-\ncal tasks such as guideline retrieval, decision support, or\nautomated follow-up scheduling. For instance, in a recent\nmulti-reader pilot at our center, we deployed an agentic\nworkﬂow for generating radiology reports, using four sequen-\ntial LLM agents capable of decomposing dictated keywords,\nretrieving relevant radiographic features via web search, syn-\nthesizing key ﬁndings, and validating the ﬁnal structured\nreports. The agentic pipeline signiﬁcantly reduced the time\nto report generation, supporting the feasibility and efﬁciency\nof agentic reporting systems in real-world practice. Despite\ntheir potential to markedly reduce cognitive burden, these\nautomated systems remain computationallycostlier and prop-\nagate errors across multiple interdependent tasks, challenging\nconventional evaluation metrics.\n4\nTherefore, rigorous evaluation methods must move be-\nyond traditional metrics like BLEU scores or token-matching\naccuracy. Comprehensive evaluation frameworks including\nspeciﬁc ones for agentic workﬂows, such as those suggested\nby Jiang et al in their MedAgentBench paper5 and combining\nwith automated metrics, adversarial stress-testing also\nDOI https://doi.org/\n10.1055/s-0045-1811264.\nISSN 0971-3026.\n© 2025.

Radiologists should\nalways retain oversight of clinically impactful decisions, with\nautomated outputs clearly being highlighted, and preferably\nindicating conﬁdence intervals or uncertainty estimates,\nmandating radiologist review before clinical decisions are\nﬁnalized.\nIn conclusion, the radiology community must proac-\ntively and urgently adopt structured, phased strategies\nthat address privacy concerns, ensure interoperability,\nrigorously validate emerging agentic tools, and support\nongoing performance monitoring. These steps are essential\nto responsibly harness the full potential of LLMs in aug-\nmenting radiologic practice, while safeguarding patient\nprivacy and well-being.\nFunding\nNone.\nConﬂict of Interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1 Alex A, Kesavadas C.
