Considering that structural similarity and therefore \nthe predicted targets strongly depend on the method used for comparison, it would be highly desirable to predict \ntargets using a broader set of fps simultaneously.\nResults: Herein, we present the polypharmacology browser (PPB), a web‑based platform which predicts possible tar‑\ngets for small molecules by searching for nearest neighbors using ten different fps describing composition, substruc‑\ntures, molecular shape and pharmacophores. PPB searches through 4613 groups of at least 10 same target annotated \nbioactive molecules from ChEMBL and returns a list of predicted targets ranked by consensus voting scheme and p \nvalue. A validation study across 670 drugs with up to 20 targets showed that combining the predictions from all 10 \nfps gives the best results, with on average 50% of the known targets of a drug being correctly predicted with a hit \nrate of 25%. Furthermore, when profiling a new inhibitor of the calcium channel TRPV6 against 24 targets taken from \na safety screen panel, we observed inhibition in 5 out of 5 targets predicted by PPB and in 7 out of 18 targets not pre‑\ndicted by PPB. The rate of correct (5/12) and incorrect (0/12) predictions for this compound by PPB was comparable to \nthat of other web‑based prediction tools.\nConclusion: PPB offers a versatile platform for target prediction based on multi‑fingerprint comparisons, and is freely \naccessible at www.gdb.unibe.ch as a valuable support for drug discovery.\nKeywords: Target prediction, Polypharmacology, Drug–target interactions, Molecular fingerprints\n© The Author(s) 2017.

Many computational \ntools have been developed that exploit databases con -\ntaining detailed structural information on the activity of \nsmall molecule drugs [ 4–8] and their protein targets [ 9] \nto predict the polypharmacology of any hit compound \nor drug candidate [ 10–37]. Several of these tools are \naccessible as target prediction websites (Table 1). Each of \nthese websites returns a list of predicted targets based on \nsimilarity calculations using molecular fingerprints (fps) \nor on docking scores.\nLigand-based methods using fp comparisons are par -\nticularly versatile because they are applicable to any bio -\nlogical activity, i.e. the target may be a protein but also \na cell line or a whole organism. Although some of these \nligand based tools offer a selection of different fps, none \nof them permits the simultaneous use of more than \none fp. Considering the fact that molecular similarity \nand therefore the predicted targets strongly depend on \nwhich fp is used for comparison, it would be highly desir-\nable to predict targets using multiple fps simultaneously, \nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  jean‑louis.reymond@dcb.unibe.ch \nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Center \nof Competence in Research NCCR Chemical Biology and NCCR TransCure, \nUniversity of Berne, Freiestrasse 3, 3012 Berne, Switzerland\nPage 2 of 10Awale and Reymond  J Cheminform  (2017) 9:11 \nprovided that each fp would perform well individually in \nvirtual screening and target prediction test cases. Herein \nwe present the polypharmacology browser (PPB), a multi-\nfingerprint browser for target prediction which addresses \nthis issue by performing target predictions searches using \nsix different fps and four fused molecular fingerprints \n(Ffps) (Table 2). Similarities are measured using the city-\nblock distance because this similarity measure is rapidly \ncomputed and therefore well-suited for web-based simi\n-\nlarity searches in large databases [38–45]. PPB searches \nthrough 2.7 M ligand-target interactions extracted from \nChEMBL 21 and generates a list of predicted targets, \neach linked to the lists of known actives used for the \nprediction. PPB validation is presented for 670 drugs of \nknown polypharmacology as well as in a predictive appli\n-\ncation of off-targets for a recently reported inhibitor of \ntransient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) [46]. \nPPB is freely accessible at www.gdb.unibe.ch and works \non computers, tablets and phones.\nMethods\nDataset\nWe analyzed ChEMBL 21 and constructed the target \ndatabase containing 4613 groups of at least 10 bioac\n-\ntive molecules with documented activity against the \nsame biological target. Briefly, target database was con\n-\nstructed as follows: initially all targets along with their \nligands were retrieved from the ChEMBL version 21. \nTable 1 Publicly accessible web-based target prediction tools\nWebsite Similarity method Database Ref.\nwww.gdb.unibe.ch 10 different fingerprints ChEMBL 21 This work\nhttp://www.pharmaexpert.ru/passonline/ Multilevel neighbourhoods of atoms (MNA) \ndescriptors\nWDI and ACD [10]\nhttp://www.dddc.ac.cn/tarfisdock/ Docking PDTD [12]\nhttp://sea.bkslab.org ECfp4 CHEMBL 16, WOMBAT, MDDR and StarLite [14]\nhttp://59.78.96.61/pharmmapper/ Receptor‑based pharmacophore models TargetBank, DrugBank, BindingDB, PDTD [17]\nhttps://cpi.bio‑x.cn/drar/ Docking PDB, DrugBank [18]\nwww.cbligand.org/TargetHunter ECfp6, ECfp4 and Openbabel FP2 ChEMBL 11 and PubChem bioassay [22]\nhttp://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/chemmapper/ Openbabel FP2, MACSS, SHAFT and USR ChEMBL 14, BindingDB, DrugBank, KEGG \nand PDB\n[23]\nhttp://mips.helmholtz‑muenchen.de/proj/\nhitpick\nCircular fingerprint FCFP STITCH [24]\nhttp://modlab‑cadd.ethz.ch/software/spider/ CATS and MOE physiochemical descriptors COBRA [26]\nwww.swisstargetprediction.ch Openbabel FP2 and Electroshape descriptors ChEMBL 16 [28]\nhttp://prediction.charite.de/index.php ECfp4 ChEMBL, SuperTarget and BindingDB [29]\nwww.dddc.ac.cn/tarpred ECfp4 BindingDB [33]\nhttp://potentia.cbs.dtu.dk/ChemProt Sfp ChEMBL 14, BindingDB, DrugBank, \nPharmGKB, PubChem bioassay, WOMBAT, \nIUPHAR, CTD and STITCH\n[37]\nTable 2 Molecular fingerprints used for target prediction with PPB\nName Description Ref.\nAPfp 21‑D atom‑pair fingerprint, perceives molecular shape [43]\nXfp 55‑D atom category extended atom‑pair fingerprint, perceives pharmacophores [43]\nMQN 42‑D Molecular Quantum Numbers, scalar fingerprint counting atoms, bonds, polarity and ring features, perceives constitution, \ntopology and molecular shape\n[38]\nSMIfp 34‑D scalar fingerprint counting occurrence of characters in SMILES, perceives rings, aromaticity, and polarity [42]\nSfp 1024‑D binary daylight type substructure fingerprint, perceives detailed substructures [49]\nECfp4 1024‑D binary circular extended connectivity fingerprint, perceives detailed substructures and pharmacophores [50]\nFfp1 Fusion fingerprint, Xfp + SMIfp + Sfp This work\nFfp2 Fusion fingerprint, Xfp + MQN + SMIfp This work\nFfp3 Fusion fingerprint, Xfp + SMIfp + Sfp + ECfp4 This work\nFfp4 Fusion fingerprint, Xfp + MQN + SMIfp + Sfp + ECfp4 This work\nPage 3 of 10\nAwale and Reymond  J Cheminform  (2017) 9:11 \nFor each target we retained the compounds having IC 50, \nEC50, GI50, Ki, KD, or potency value of ≤10 µM or percent \ninhibition of >50%. All molecules were processed as non-\nstereo SMILES and ionized at pH 7.4 using an in-house \ndeveloped Java program utilizing the JChem chemistry \nlibrary from ChemAxon Pvt. Ltd. Afterwards, duplicate \nmolecules were removed in the context of each target. \nFinally, targets with at least 10 bioactive compounds were \nretained in database. In total, these 4613 targets repre\n-\nsent 871,673 unique bioactive compounds and 2.7  M \nligand-target interactions. Of these targets, 60% are sin\n-\ngle protein type, 55% are human targets, and 45% have \nless than 50 bioactive compounds (Fig. 1a–c).\nFingerprints\nFor each of the 871,673 selected ChEMBL compounds \nwe computed each of the six fingerprints described \nin Table  2. In short, APfp, Xfp, MQN and SMIfp were \ncalculated by using an in house developed Java pro\n-\ngram utilizing various calculator plugins from JChem \nchemistry library, in particular TopologyAnalyserPlugin \nto determine shortest topological path for atom-pair, \nHBDAplugins to determine hydrogen bond donor and \nacceptor atoms, and MajorMicrospeciesPlugin to adjust \nthe ionization state of molecules. The detailed procedure \nfor the generation of these fingerprints can be found in \nthe respective publication [38, 42, 43]. For Sfp, a day\n-\nlight type 1024-bit hash fingerprint was computed using \nthe ChemicalFingerprint class of the JChem library. The \n1024-bit extended connectivity fingerprint (ECfp4) was \ncalculated with bond diameter of 4 using ECFP class of \nthe JChem library. The source codes for computation of \nfingerprints are freely available for download at www.\ngdb.unibe.ch.\nFused fingerprints (Data fusion)\nTo generate additional molecular fingerprint descriptions \nwe further investigated data fusion between different \ncombinations of these fingerprints [47]. Since we aimed \nat using the city-block distance (Eq. 1) as similarity meas\n-\nure, we scaled each fingerprint by analyzing the distance \ndistribution of 50 M random pairs of compounds in each \nfingerprint space, and scaled values to adjust the most \nfrequently occurring distance in each fp to the value for \nXfp (Fig.  1d/e). We then performed enrichment studies \nof ligands against decoys in the directory of useful decoys \n(DUD) [48] and evaluated the average performance of \n57 different combinations of the scaled fingerprints in \nterms of area under the curve (AUC) and enrichment \nfactor at 1% screening in the receiver operator charac\n-\nteristic (ROC) curves (data not shown). We selected the \nfour fusion fingerprints Ffp1–Ffp4 (Table  2) due to their \ngood performance in this enrichment study (Fig.  1f/g), \nand computed the corresponding Ffp1–4 values for the \n871,673 ChEMBL compounds.\np value calculation\nEach target prediction for a given query molecule is \nbased on the city-block distance between the query mol\n-\necule and the closest member of a group of compounds \nassociated with this target. A p value can be computed \nfor each prediction as the degree of randomness of the \nobserved city block distance [51] and therefore the prob\n-\nability that the corresponding query–target association \noccurs at random. To compute the p value, we generated \na random distance distribution for each of the 4613 tar\n-\ngets in each of the ten fingerprint spaces by computing \ndistances between the ChEMBL compounds associated \nwith the target and randomly selected molecules from the \nZINC database [52], taken as representative molecules of \nscreening compounds for which target predictions might \nbe carried out (Fig. 1h). For each target up to 1 M random \npairs were considered. We then fitted each of the 46,130 \ndistance distributions using a negative binomial distribu\n-\ntion function, and generated the corresponding cumula -\ntive density functions giving the p value as a function of \nthe city block distance (Fig.  1i). The choice of a negative \nbinomial distribution function was based on the discrete \nnature of the city-block distance. As the p value calcu\n-\nlation is specific for each target protein and fingerprint \nspace it can only be used in this context, and should not \nbe used to compare molecules from different targets or \nfingerprint spaces. The curve fitting was carried out using \nthe R statistical package version 3.2.5 using the “fitdis\n-\ntrplus” library with default maximum likelihood method \nfor parameters estimation.\nValidation set\nThe validation set containing 670 drugs and their tar -\ngets annotation was created as follows: (a) compounds \nlabelled as approved drug or drug in clinical trial were \nextracted from ChEMBL database, (b) for each drug, tar\n-\nget list was constructed by comparing SMILES string of \ndrug to SMILES of bioactive compounds of targets used \nin the PPB. When the SMILES string was matched, cor\n-\nrosponding PPB target was added to known target list for \nthe drug and (c) retained the drugs with ≤20 targets in \nthe list.\nThe PPB web‑interface\nGiven a query molecule, PPB computes each of the 10 \nfps for this compound, sorts the 871,673 ChEMBL com\n-\npounds by city-block distance to the query using each fp \n(1)CBD A,B =\nK∑\nj=1\n⏐⏐Aj− Bj\n⏐\n⏐\nPage 4 of 10Awale and Reymond  J Cheminform  (2017) 9:11 \n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n1 10 1001 0001 0000\nAPfp (2.80)\nXfp (1)\nMQN (24.9)\nSMIfp (60.7)\nSfp (4.46)\nECfp4 (18.9)\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n11 01 00 1000 10000\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nCity block distance\nsriap modnar fo noitcarF\nCity block distance\nFraction of random pairs\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\nTarget count\nType\nSingle protein\nProtein family\nProtein complex\nCell line\nOrganism\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\nTarget count\nSource\nHomo sapien\nRattus norvegicus\nMus musculus\nBos taurus\nSus scrofa\nOthers\n0\n500\n1000\n10\n-29\n30\n-49\n50\n-69\n70\n-89\n90\n-10\n9\n110-\n129\n13\n0-14\n9\n150\n-16\n9\n170\n-189\n190\n-20\n9\n21\n0-22\n9\n230\n-24\n9\n250\n-269\n270-\n28\n9\n290-\n30\n9\n310-\n32\n9\n330\n-349\n350-\n36\n9\n370-\n38\n9\n390\n-409\n410-\n42\n9\n430-\n44\n9\n450\n-46\n9\n>4\n69\nCompounds\nTargets\nFingerprints\nAUC %\nFingerprints\nEF 1%\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\n10\n14\n18\n22\n26\n30\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nCity block distance\nsriap modnar fo noitcarF\nCity block distance\nCumulative density (p-value)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\nObserved\nFitted\na b c\nd e\nf g\nh i\nPage 5 of 10\nAwale and Reymond  J Cheminform  (2017) 9:11 \nindependently, and collects a predefined number of com-\npound associated targets in each case.

Finally, PPB merges the different target lists.\nThe graphical user interface of PPB starts with an initial \npage wherein the user can input the structure of a query \nmolecule using the JavaScript based JSME molecular edi\n-\ntor (http://peter-ertl.com/jsme/) [53].

The option “No. of targets” allows \nthe user to input the number of targets to be returned by \neach fp. By default this parameter is set to 20. Following \nthe entry of a query molecule, the target search can be \ninitiated by clicking on the “Submit” button. Typically, \nexecution of a search takes less than 1 min.\nThe target prediction results are presented as list of tar\n-\ngets annotated with a probability bar for each fp (Fig.  2a). \nThe p value is shown by a green bar of decreasing length \nup to p = 0.01, with values above 0.01 written as number in \n(See figure on previous page.) \nFig. 1 Overview of the data used for constructing PPB.

In the initial display the list of \ntargets is sorted by frequency of occurrence and sum of p \nvalues across the 10 fps, which defines the target rank (first \ncolumn). The list can also be sorted by ChEMBL target id, \ntarget name, and by the number of selected compounds by \nclicking on the corresponding column heading.\nClicking on the number of selected compounds per \ntarget (furthest right column) opens a new tab displaying \nthe structures of these compounds labelled with finger\n-\nprints, city-block distance and ChEMBL compound id \n(Fig. 2b). The selection of a row in the table displays the \nfull name of the target in the “Target name” field, which is \nan active link to the parent ChEMBL database to obtain \nfurther information on this target. The result (targets and \nmolecules) can be stored as text file using the “save” but\n-\nton provided in each window.\nResults and discussion\nThe performance of PPB was evaluated by challenging \nits ability to recall the known targets of 670 compounds \nlabelled as approved drug or drug in clinical trial and anno\n-\ntated with up to 20 targets in ChEMBL (4794 drug–tar -\nget interactions). Prior to evaluation these 670 drugs were \nremoved from our target compound database. Among \nthese drugs 71% had less than 10 associated targets and the \nremaining 29% had 10–20 associated targets (Fig. 3).\nThe 670 different searches were performed using PPB \nwith the default search settings. The predicted targets \nwere analysed for each fp considering (a) all targets, (b) \ntargets with p value ≤0.01 and (c) targets with p value \n>0.01 (Fig.  4; Additional file  1: Fig. S1). When combin\n-\ning the results of the different fps (last column, “comb” in \nFig. 4a–d) we only considered the targets voted by at least \n2 different fps. For each drug, we calculated the fraction \nof known targets in the results list, the total number of \npredicted targets and the hit rate (ratio of known targets \nfound to predicted targets).\nIn terms of the fraction of correctly predicted known \ntargets (Fig.  4a) the fusion fingerprints Ffp1, Ffp3 and \nFfp4 showed the highest average value, followed by the \nbinary fingerprints Sfp and ECfp4, the pharmacophore \nfingerprint Xfp, and finally MQN, SMIfp and APfp. To \nevaluate if the performance of these fingerprints signifi\n-\ncantly differ from one another or not, the student t tests \n(at confidence interval of 0.95) were performed for all the \npossible pairs of fingerprints (Additional file  1: Tables S1 \nand S2). Although most of the individual fingerprint pairs \nshow significant differences in performance, no signifi\n-\ncant differences were found between performance of Sfp, \nECfp4, Ffp1 and Ffp2. Overall the performance trend fol\n-\nlowed the complexity of each fingerprint and highlights \nthat detailed structural encoding tends to increase pre\n-\ndiction performance.\nThese single fp approaches were outperformed by using \nthe combination of all 10 results lists (combined method), \nhowever at the expense of a relatively low hit rate result\n-\ning from checking a larger number of targets for each \ndrug as compared to individual fps (Fig.  4b/c). The com\n-\nbined method also showed the highest success rate for \nfinding at least one known target among the 5 top pre\n-\ndicted targets for each fp (Fig. 4d). For all methods except \nSMIfp the predicted target list with p value ≤0.01 showed \na significantly greater chance of success compared to the \ntarget lists with p value >0.01. The importance of a low p \nvalue for target prediction was particularly striking with \nthe fused fingerprints Ffp1–4 and the combined method, \nfor which more than 75% of all correct predictions origi\n-\nnated from predicted targets with p value ≤0.01.\nAlthough several of the fps were not statistically dif -\nferent in terms of performance, the pairwise overlap \nbetween predicted targets by each of the 10 different fps \nshowed that on average less than 45% of targets were com\n-\nmon between any two fps (Fig.  4f). Furthermore each fp \nretrieved a significant number of unique targets which are \nnot found by any other fp, further highlighting the utility \nof each fp. Interestingly, APfp and Xfp, which perceive \nthe shape and pharmacophore patterns in molecules, \nreturned the highest percentages of unique targets (52 \nand 31% respectively). For fused fingerprints Ffp1–4 the \npercentages of unique targets were relatively low (3–10%) \ndue to the considerable overlap among themselves.\nA similar analysis performed by categorizing targets \naccording to their p values (Fig.  4g/h) showed that the \nNo. of targets\nNo. of drugs\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n12345678 91 01 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 92 0\nFig. 3 Distribution of 670 ChEMBL compounds labelled as drug in \nclinical trial or as approved drug used in validation study according to \nnumber of associated targets\nPage 7 of 10\nAwale and Reymond  J Cheminform  (2017) 9:11 \npairwise overlap between high confidence (low p value) \ntargets of different fingerprints were significantly higher \n(on average 47% overlap) as compared to low confi\n-\ndence targets (high p value, on average 24% overlap). \nThis can be explained by the fact that at high p values \nthe structural similarity between a query and its nearest \nneighbour compound associated with the target becomes \nless obvious and difficult to capture (Fig. 4e).\nPrediction of off‑targets of a new TRPV6 inhibitor\nWe recently reported the identification of CIS22a \n(Fig.  5a) as the first potent and selective inhibitor of \n% found in \ntargets of:\n% found in \ntargets of:\n% found in \ntargets of:\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\noverall\ntargets with p-value ≤0.01\ntargets with p-value >0.01\noverall targets with p-value ≤0.01 targets with p-value >0.01\nFingerprints\nFingerprints\nSuccess rateAverage tanimoto\ntargets of: targets of: targets of:\n25\n50\n75\n100\nvalue\nUnique\nFfp4\nFfp3\nFfp2\nFfp1\nECfp4\nSfp\nSMIfp\nMQN\nXfp\nAPfp\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\n25\n50\n75\n100\nvalue\nUnique\nFfp4\nFfp3\nFfp2\nFfp1\nECfp4\nSfp\nSMIfp\nMQN\nXfp\nAPfp\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\np\np\np\np\n4\n3\n4\n25\n50\n75\n100\nvalue\nUnique\nFfp4\nFfp3\nFfp2\nFfp1\nECfp4\nSfp\nSMIfp\nMQN\nXfp\nAPfp\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\n0\n10\n20\n30\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\nAPfp\nXfp\nMQN\nSMIfp\nSfp\nECfp4\nFfp1\nFfp2\nFfp3\nFfp4\nComb\nAvg.

We tested the \npolypharmacology of this inhibitor for 24 out of 44 tar -\ngets present in the “safety screen” panel of Cerep Pvt. Ltd \n(Fig. 5b/c). To assemble this target list we first inspected \nthe PPB results list and chose five targets selected by mul\n-\ntiple fps considering in each case the target from human \nand rat origin as the same target. These were the adren\n-\nergic α1A receptor (ADRA1A), the dopamine receptor \nsubtypes D1 (DRD1), D2 (DRD2), and D4 (DRD4), the \n5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (HTR1A). We then \nadded further subtypes of these five targets as well as all \nion channels present in the safety screen panel, resulting \nin a list of 17 GPCRs and seven ions channels.\nIn-vitro profiling showed that CIS22a bound signifi\n-\ncantly (>50% inhibition at 10 µM) to 12 targets of the 24 \nselected targets (Fig.  5b). Five of these targets (ADR1A, \nDRD1, DRD2, DRD4 and 5HTR1A) were proposed by \nmultiple fps in the PPB. Only two of the Ffps (Ffp1 and \nFfp3) and the combined method were able to predict all \nof the five targets, illustrating the usefulness of similar\n-\nity fusion methods and combined data analysis.

Interestingly, the linking compounds for \nthree targets (DRD2, DRD4 and HTR1A) suggested by \nXfp were not shared by any other fps, probably because \nof their relatively low substructure similarity to the query \ncompound. On the other hand Xfp predicted an activity \non ADRA2A, which was not confirmed experimentally \n(only 31% inhibition at 10 µM).\nFor comparison we successfully ran target predictions \nfor CIS22a using six of the fourteen target prediction \nweb-based tools listed in Table  1. Results comparable to \nPPB were obtained with SwissTarget, SuperPred, Target\n-\nHunter, ChemMapper and ChEMBLPred. On the other \nhand, SEA only returned a single, correct target, and \nPharmMapper did not predict any of the tested targets.\nConclusion\nThe PPB web tool features a unique, intuitive and exhaus-\ntive search platform for target prediction.
