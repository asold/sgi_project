User goals\nare represented in terms of values of pre-deﬁned\nslots associated with a schema determined by the\ninformation needed to execute task-speciﬁc queries\nto the backend. In other words, user goals are ex-\ntracted progressively via slot ﬁlling based on the\nschema throughout the conversation. In this paper,\nwe focus on multi-domain DST where the dialogue\nstate is encoded as a list of triplets in the form of\n(domain, slot, value), e.g. (“restaurant”, “area”,\n“centre”).\nThere are two broad paradigms of DST models,\nclassiﬁcation-based and generation-basedmodels,\nwhere the major diﬀerence is how the slot value is\ninferred. In classiﬁcation-based models (Ye et al.,\n2021; Chen et al., 2020), the prediction of a slot\nvalue is restricted to a ﬁxed set for each slot, and\nnon-categorical slots are constrained to values ob-\nserved in the training data. In contrast, generation-\nbased models (Wu et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020)\ndecode slot values sequentially (token by token)\nbased on the dialogue context, with the potential\nof recovering unseen values. Recently, generation-\nbased DST built on large-scale pretrained neural\nlanguage models (LM) achieve strong results with-\nout relying on domain-speciﬁc modules. Among\nthem, the autoregressive model (Peng et al., 2020a;\nHosseini-Asl et al., 2020) uses a uni-directional\nencoder whereas the sequence-to-sequence model\n(Lin et al., 2020a; Heck et al., 2020) represents the\ndialogue context using a bi-directional encoder.\nIn this study, we follow a generation-based DST\napproach using a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence\nmodel, but with the new strategy of adding task-\nspeciﬁc prompts as input for sequence-to-sequence\nDST models, inspired byprompt-basedﬁne-tuning\n(Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020a). Specif-\nically, instead of generating domain and slot sym-\nbols in the decoder, we concatenate the dialogue\ncontext with domain and slot prompts as input to\nthe encoder, where prompts are taken directly from\nthe schema. We hypothesize that jointly encoding\ndialogue context and schema-speciﬁc textual infor-\nmation can further beneﬁt a sequence-to-sequence\nDST model. This allows task-aware contextualiza-\ntion for more eﬀectively guiding the decoder to\ngenerate slot values.\nAlthough the domain and slot names typically\nhave interpretable components, they often do not\nreﬂectstandardwrittenEnglish,e.g.“ arriveby”and\n“ref”. Those custom meaning representations are\n4938\ntypicallyabbreviatedand/orunder-speciﬁed,which\ncreates a barrier for eﬀectively utilizing the pre-\ntrained LMs. To address this issue, we further\nincorporate natural language schema descriptions\ninto prompting for DST, which include useful in-\nformation to guide the decoder. For example, the\ndescription of “ref” is “reference number of the ho-\ntelbooking”;thevaluesof“ has_internet”are“yes”,\n“no”, “free”, and “don’t care”.\nIn short, this work advances generation-based\nDST in two ways. First, candidate schema labels\nare jointly encoded with the dialogue context, pro-\nvidingatask-awarecontextualizationforinitializing\nthe decoder. Second, natural language descriptions\nofschemacategoriesassociatedwithdatabasedocu-\nmentation are incorporated in encoding as prompts\nto the language model, allowing uniform handling\nof categorical and non-categorical slots. When\nimplemented using a strong pretrained text-to-text\nmodel, this simple approach achieves state-of-the-\nart (SOTA) results on MultiWOZ 2.2, and perfor-\nmance is on par with SOTA on MultiWOZ 2.1 and\nM2M. In addition, our analyses provide empirical\nresults that contribute towards understanding how\nschema description augmentation can eﬀectively\nconstrain the model prediction.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking\nTask-oriented dialogue datasets (Shah et al., 2018;\nHenderson et al., 2014), have spurred the develop-\nmentofdialoguesystems(Zhongetal.,2018;Chao\nand Lane, 2019). Recently, to further examine the\ngeneralization abilities, large scale cross-domain\ndatasets have been proposed (Budzianowski et al.,\n2018; Zang et al., 2020; Eric et al., 2019; Rastogi\net al., 2020b). Classiﬁcation-based models (Ye\net al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020) pick the candidate\nfrom the oracle list of possible slot values. The\nassumption of the full access of the schema makes\nthem have limited generalization abilities. On the\nother hand,generation-based models (Wu et al.,\n2019; Kim et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020a) directly\ngenerate slot values token by token, making it pos-\nsibletohandleunseendomainsandvalues. Mostof\nthese models require task-speciﬁc modular designs.\nRecently, generation-based models that are built\non large-scale autoregressive pretrained language\nmodels(Hametal.,2020;Hosseini-Asletal.,2020;\nPeng et al., 2020a) achieve promising state track-\ning results on MultiWOZ 2.0 and 2.1 when trained\non additional supervision signals or dialogue cor-\npus. Both Ham et al. (2020) and Hosseini-Asl\net al. (2020) require dialogue acts as inputs. Both\nHosseini-Asl et al. (2020) and Peng et al. (2020a)\nrequire DB search results as inputs. Peng et al.\n(2020a) also leverages other dialogue corpora to\nﬁnetune the language model. Our work requires\nonly the dialogue state labels and does not utilize\nany external dialogue datasets.\n2.2 Language Models\nLarge-scale pretrained language models have ob-\ntained state-of-the-art performance on diverse\ngeneration and understanding tasks including bi-\ndirectional encoder style language models (Devlin\net al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019), auto-regressive lan-\nguage models (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,\n2020b)andmoreﬂexiblesequence-to-sequencelan-\nguage models (Raﬀel et al., 2020). To adapt to di-\nalogue tasks, variants of systems are ﬁnetuned on\ndiﬀerent dialogue corpora including chit-chat sys-\ntems (Zhang et al., 2020; Adiwardana et al., 2020;\nRoller et al., 2020) and task-oriented dialogue sys-\ntems (Mehri et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020; Hender-\nson et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020b). We leave it as\nfuture work to leverage domain-adapted language\nmodels.\n2.3 Prompting Language Models\nExtending a language model’s knowledge via\nprompts is an active line of research. Radford\net al. (2019) obtain empirical success by using\nprompts to guide zero shot generation without ﬁne-\ntuning on any prompts. Raﬀel et al. (2020) uses\ntask-speciﬁc prompts in both ﬁnetuning and testing\nphase. Recent studies have also tried to automati-\ncally discover prompts rather than writing them by\nhumans (Jiang et al., 2020). Our proposed prompt-\ning method is largely inspired by this body of work.\nInsteadofpromptengineering/generation,wefocus\non using available natural language descriptions of\nschema categories associated with database docu-\nmentation as task-speciﬁc promptings for DST.\n3 Prompting Language Model for\nDialogue State Tracking\nIn this section, we ﬁrst set up the notations that are\nused throughout paper, and then review the genera-\ntiveDSTwiththesequence-to-sequenceframework.\nBased on that, we formally introduce our prompt-\nbased DST model and the corresponding backbone\n4939\n[User] …\n[System] …\n[Slot]\nref\n[Domain]\ntrain \n[Slot]\nday\ndestination location of the \ntrain, [Possible Values]\nLondon Kings Cross , …\nday of the departure, \n[Possible Values]\nMonday, …, Sunday \nreference  number \nof the hotel booking\nLondon \nKings \nCross\nMonday\nnone\n[User] Can you help me \nfind a train for Sunday. \nI would like to visit \nLondon Kings Street .\n[Slot]\ndestination\n[Domain]\ntrain \n[Domain]\nhotel \nNL DescriptionDomain 𝒅𝒎 Slot 𝒔𝒏 Value 𝒗Dialogue History 𝑪𝒕\n… … … … …\nT5Dialogue History …\n(a) Generation-based DST w/ Sequential Decoding\ntrain day Monday\nDialogue History train day T5 Monday\nLondon Kings Cross\nnone\n……\n(b) Schema-Based Prompt DST w/ Independent Decoding\ntrain destinationDialogue History\nhotel refDialogue History\nT5\nT5\n…\ntrain day day of the departure …Dialogue History\ntrain destination destination location…Dialogue History\n…\nhotel ref reference  number…Dialogue History\nT5 Monday\nLondon Kings Cross\nnone\n…\nT5\nT5\n…\n(c) Natural Language Augmented Prompt DST w/ Independent Decoding\nFigure 1: Overview of generative DST approaches for multi-domain scenario.

For task-oriented dialogues consid-\nered in this paper, a dialogue consists of a se-\nquence of utterances alternating between two par-\nties, U1,A1,...,U T,AT, whereU and Arepresent\nthe user utterance and the system response, re-\nspectively. In a turnt, the user provides a new\nutterance Ut and the system agent responds with\nutterance At. As shown in the bottom of Fig-\nure 1, at turnt, we denote the dialogue context\nasCt = {U1,A1,… ,At−1,Ut}, whichexcludesthe\nlatest system responseAt. In this work, we assume\na multi-domain scenario, in which case the schema\ncontains M domains  = {d1,… ,dM} and N\nslots  = {s1,… ,sN} to track as examples illus-\ntrated in Figure 1.Bt, the dialogue state at turnt,\nis then deﬁned as a mapping from a pair (dm, sn)\ninto valuesv. Here, we deﬁneBt(dm,sn) = \u001e, if\n(dm,sn) is not in the current dialogue state. In the\ngiven example of Figure 1, the pair (domain=hotel,\nslot=ref) is not in the dialogue state, and the value\n“none” is assigned.\n3.1 Generation-based DST with the\nSequence-to-sequence Model\nThere are primarily two decoding strategies for\ngeneration-based DST in the literature for inferring\nthedialoguestateataparticularturn–sequential(a)\n4940\nandindependent(b)(c)–bothofwhichareexplored\nin the paper as illustrated in Figure 1.\nIn the ﬁrst case (top system (a) in Figure 1), the\ndialogue historyCt is taken as input to the encoder,\nand domain-slot-value triplets (dm, sn, v) are gen-\nerated sequentially, whereBt(dm,sn) ≠ \u001e. This\napproach is adopted in many systems that leverage\nautoregressive LMs (Peng et al., 2020a; Hosseini-\nAsl et al., 2020). Despite being simple, this kind\nof sequential generation of multiple values is more\nlikely to suﬀer from optimization issues with de-\ncoding long sequences resulting in lower perfor-\nmance. However, given its wide adoption in the\nliterature, we still include this type of generative\nDST with the same backbone pretrained encoder-\ndecoderTransformermodelinourexperiments. To\npartially address this issue, Lin et al. (2020b) pro-\npose a domain independent decoding where the\ndecoder only have to generate a sequence of slot\nand value pairs within a speciﬁc given domain. Al-\nthough their model leverages the same backbone\nmodelasours, weempiricallyﬁndthatthisformof\nstrategy is still of limited eﬀectiveness.\nIn the second case (middle two systems (b)(c)\nin Figure 1), the values for each domain-slot pair\nare generated independently, potentially in parallel.\nThe domain and slot names (embedded as contin-\nuous representations) are either the initial hidden\nstate of the decoder (Kim et al., 2020) or the ﬁrst\ninputofthedecoder(Wuetal.,2019). Valuesareei-\nther generated for all possible domain-slot(dm,sn)\npairswithapossiblevalueof“ none”and/orthereis\na separate gating mechanism for domain-slot com-\nbinations not currently active. Since we are inter-\nested in enriching the input with task-speciﬁc in-\nformation, we focus on extending the independent\ndecoding modeling for our prompt-based DST.\n3.2 Prompt-based DST\nIn this section, we formally present the ﬂow of\nour prompt-based DST with an encoder-decoder\narchitecture. Here, we are interested in an encoder-\ndecodermodelwithabi-directionalencoder(Raﬀel\netal.,2020;Lewisetal.,2020),incontrastwiththe\nuni-directionalencoderusedinautoregressiveLMs\n(Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020a).\nThe input of the prompt-based DST is made\nup of a dialogue contextCt and a task-speciﬁc\nprompt. Here, we use two types of task-speciﬁc\nprompts, the domain-related promptX(dm), and\nslot-related promptX(sn), both of which are de-\nrived based on the given schema. We leave the\ndiscussion of two speciﬁc realizations of task-\nspeciﬁc prompts to the later part of this sec-\ntion. Speciﬁcally, all sub-sequences are concate-\nnated with special segment tokens, i.e., “[user]\nU1 [system] A1 ... [system] At−1 [user]\nUt [domain] X(dm) [slot] X(sn)”, as in-\nput to the encoder, where[user], [system],\n[domain],[slot] are special segment tokens\nfor indicating the start of a speciﬁc user utterance,\nsystem utterance, domain-related prompt, and slot-\nrelated prompt, respectively.\nGiven this prompt-augmented input, the bi-\ndirectional encoder then outputs\nHt = Encoder(Ct,X(dm),X(sn)), (1)\nwhere Ht ∈ ℝL×k is the hidden states of the en-\ncoder,Lis the input sequence length, andkis the\nencoder hidden size. Then, the decoder attends to\nthe encoder hidden states and decodes the corre-\nsponding slot valueBt(dm,sn):\nBt(dm,sn) =Decoder(Ht). (2)\nThe overall learning objective of this generation\nprocessing is maximizing the log-likelihood of\nBt(dm,sn) givenCt, X(dm) andX(sn), that is\nÉ\n(m,n)\nlog P(Bt(dm,sn)ðCt,X(dm),X(sn)). (3)\nDuring inference, a greedy decoding procedure is\ndirectly applied, i.e., only the most likely token in\nthe given model vocabulary is predicted at each\ndecoding step.\nSchema-Based Prompt. The ﬁrst realization of\ntask-speciﬁc prompt considered in this paper is\nbased on the domain and slot names as deﬁned\nin the task-dependent schema. As shown in (b) of\nFigure 1, given the domain nametrainand the slot\nname day, the speciﬁc prompt is in the form of\n“[domain] train[slot] day”. Diﬀerent from\n(Lin et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2019) where the task-\nspeciﬁc information is used in the decoder side,\nour symbol-based prompt as additional input to the\nbi-directional encoder can potentially achieve task-\naware contextualizations. Observing that users of-\nten revise/repair their earlier requests in dialogues,\nwe posit that the resulting encoded representations\ncan be more eﬀectively used by the decoder for\ngenerating corresponding slot values.\nNatural Language Augmented Prompt. One\nmain drawback of symbol-based prompt is that\n4941\nDataset MWOZ 2.2 MWOZ 2.1 M2M\n# Domains 8 8 2\n# Dialogues 10438 10438 3008\n# Total Turns 143004 143048 27120\nAvg.

Fortunately,documenta-\ntioniscommonlyavailableforreal-worlddatabases,\nand it is a rich resource for domain knowledge that\nallows dialogue systems to better understand the\nmeaningsoftheabbreviateddomainandslotnames.\nThe documentation includes but is not limited to\ndomain/slot descriptions and the list of possible\nvalues for categorical slots. In this work, we ex-\nperiment with a simple approach that augments the\ninput by incorporating the domain description after\nthe domain name and the slot description (with the\nsequence of values, if any) following the slot name,\nas illustrated in the system (c) in Figure 1.\n3.3 Backbone Sequence-to-sequence Model\nOur prompt-based DST model is initialized with\nweights from a pretrained LM in an encoder-\ndecoder fashion. In this paper, we use the Text-to-\nText Transformer (T5) (Raﬀel et al., 2020) as our\nbackbone model. T5 is an encoder-decoder Trans-\nformerwithrelativepositionencodings(Shawetal.,\n2018). We refer interested readers to the original\npaper for more details.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Datasets\nTable 1 summarizes the statistics of the datasets\nused in our experiments.\nMultiWOZ(Budzianowski et al., 2018) is a multi-\ndomaintask-orienteddialoguedatasetthatcontains\nover 10K dialogues across 8 domains. It is a col-\nlection of human-human written conversations and\nhas been one of the most popular benchmarks in\ntheDSTliterature. Sinceitsinitialrelease,manyer-\nroneous annotations and user utterances have been\nidentiﬁed and ﬁxed in subsequent versions, i.e.,\nMultiWOZ 2.1 (Eric et al., 2019) and MultiWOZ\n2.2 (Zang et al., 2020). In addition, MultiWOZ\n2.1 provides 2-3 descriptions for every slot in the\ndataset. We randomly sample one of them and use\nthe same descriptions for every experiment. The\noriginal dataset does not have domain descriptions\nand possible values so these are omitted in the cor-\nresponding experiments. MultiWOZ 2.2 further\nprovides descriptions of domain and slot as well as\npossible values for categorical slots.\nMachines Talking To Machines (M2M)(Shah\net al., 2018) is a framework that combines simula-\ntion and online crowdsourcing. Templates of each\ndialogue are ﬁrst generated and then online work-\ners rewrite the conversations to make them human-\nreadable while preserving the meaning. It provides\n3,000 dialogues spanning 2 domains. The restau-\nrant domain is denoted asSim-R and the movie\ndomainisdenotedas Sim-M.Sincetherearenode-\nscriptions provided in the corpus, we take existing\ndescriptions from other corpora that have the same\nslots. Speciﬁcally, descriptions for the restaurant\ndomain are taken from MultiWOZ 2.2, whereas\ndescriptions for the movie domain are taken from\nSGD (Rastogi et al., 2020b). All slots in M2M are\ncovered. Since all slots are non-categorical, the\ndescriptions do not include the possible values.\nEvaluation Metric. The standard joint goal accu-\nracy(JGA)isusedastheevaluationmetric. Ittreats\na prediction as correct only if for every domain all\nslots exactly match the ground-truth values. For\nMultiWOZ 2.1 and 2.2, we use the oﬃcial evalua-\ntionscriptfromtheDSTC8challenge(Rastogietal.,\n2020a).1 For M2M, we adopt the above evaluation\nscripts with simple modiﬁcations.\n1https://github.com/google-research/\ngoogle-research/tree/master/schema_\nguided_dst#evaluation-on-multiwoz-21\n4942\nModels Pretrained-Model/ # Para.

The following baseline models are\nconsidered: TRADE (Wu et al., 2019), DS-DST\n(Zhang et al., 2019) and Seq2Seq-DU (Feng et al.,\n2020). Similar to ours, the decoding strategy of\nTRADE is independent. However, the sum of do-\nmain and slot embeddings are the ﬁrst input of the\ndecoder, which makes their dialogue history rep-\nresentation not task-aware contextualized. The se-\nquential decoding strategy is worse than the inde-\npendent decoding strategy by over 5% with both\nT5-smallandT5-base. EvenwithT5-small(almost\nhalf the model size of BERT-base which is used\nin most previous benchmark models), our system\nachieves the SOTA performance using the inde-\npendent decoding. As expected, T5-base systems\noutperform T5-small systems. With the augmenta-\ntion of descriptions, we improve the overall JGA\nby over 1% in both T5-small and T5-base.\n4.3 MultiWOZ 2.1: Partially Annotated\nNatural Language Augmented Prompt\nDiﬀerent from MultiWOZ 2.2 studied in the previ-\nous section, MultiWOZ 2.1 only contains natural\nlanguage descriptions for slots but not domains. In\naddition,thereisnopossibleslotvalueinformation.\nThe evaluation results on MultiWOZ 2.1 are\nshown in Table 3, where we compare with TRADE\n(Wu et al., 2019), MinTL (Lin et al., 2020a),\nSST (Chen et al., 2020), TripPy (Heck et al.,\n2020), Simple-TOD (Hosseini-Asl et al., 2020),\nSOLOIST(Pengetal.,2020a)andTripPy+SCORE\n(Yu et al., 2020).

All our models\noutperform baselines that do not use extra dialogue\ndata. ItisworthnotingthatcomparingwithMinTL\n(T5-small), our model is better by over 4% even\nwithout descriptions. Further, our T5-small system\nis even better than MinTL built on BART-LARGE\n(Lewis et al., 2020) which has substantially more\nparameters. Similar to ours, MinTL leverages a\nsequence-to-sequence LM. One diﬀerence is that\ntheir domain information is fed only to the decoder\nwhile our approaches enables task-aware contextu-\nalization by prompting the LMs with domain and\nslot information on the encoder side. Another dif-\nference is that they jointly learn DST together with\ndialogueresponsegeneration,whichprovidesmore\nsupervision signals. Therefore, the better perfor-\nmance of our systems implies that schema-driven\nprompting is eﬀective.\nLastly, compared with MultiWOZ 2.2, the per-\nformance gain brought by augmenting natural lan-\nguage descriptions is less pronounced which is\nlikely caused by the reduced information available\nin MultiWOZ 2.1 descriptions.\n4.4 M2M: Borrowed Natural Language\nAugmented Prompt\nTable 4 shows the evaluation results on M2M.

WeachievetheSOTA\nperformance on Sim-R and Sim-M+R while being\ncomparable on Sim-M. The improvements of de-\nscriptionsareonlyevidentontherestaurantdomain.\nThe lack of improvement from slot descriptions for\nthe movie domain may be because the slot descrip-\ntions do not add much beyond the slot name (com-\npared to \"category\" for the restaurant domain) or\nthatithasslotsthatgeneralizebetteracrossdomains\n(e.g. date, time, number of people).\n5 Analysis\n5.1 Breakdown Evaluation for MultiWOZ\nIn Table 5, we follow the categorization provided\nin(Zangetal.,2020)andshowthebreakdowneval-\nuation of categorical and non-categorical slots on\nMultiWOZ2.2. Aswecansee,thebreakdownaccu-\nracyscoresforbothcategoricalandnon-categorical\nslotsare prettyconsistent withthe overall JGA. For\nboth T5-small and T5-base models, models with\nsequential decoding perform worse than the corre-\nsponding models with independent decoding for\nboth categorical and non-categorical slots. In par-\nticular, the independent decoding models achieve\nmore pronounced improvement in categorical slots\nindicatingthatthetask-speciﬁcpromptisveryhelp-\nful for guiding the decoder to predict valid values.\nWhencomparingmodelsusingnaturallanguagede-\nscription with those not, we observe performance\ngains for both types of slots for T-base but only\nnon-categorical slots for T5-small. It is likely that\nthe smaller size of T5 has limited representation\ncapability to eﬀectively utilize the additional tex-\ntual description information regarding types and\npossible values.\nModels JGA CAT NON-CAT\nSequential (T5-small) 48.9 61.3 69.0\nSequential (T5-base) 51.2 62.9 70.9\nIndependent (T5-small) 55.2 71.4 75.2\nw. desc 56.3 71.1 76.2\nw. onlyslot desc 55.2 70.4 75.8\nw. onlydomain desc 54.3 70.1 75.4\nw. onlyslot + domain desc 55.9 71.2 76\nIndependent (T5-base) 56.7 71.6 76.3\nw. desc 57.6 72.4 76.8\nTable 5: Slot type breakdown results on the test set of\nMultiWOZ 2.2.

For(i), there is an 0.4% point drop in\nJGA,validatingthatvaluesetscansuccessfullycon-\nstrain the model output, as we illustrate in Table 6.\nFor (ii), there is a 0.8% point drop in JGA. And for\n(iii), there is a 0.1% point drop in JGA. This shows\nthat slot descriptions are the mostimportant part of\nthe schema prompts and domain descriptions are\nrelatively less eﬀective. This is probably due to the\nfact that there are 61 slots in MultiWOZ 2.2 but\nonly 8 domains. Also, the domain names are all\nself-contained single words.\n5.3 The Eﬀectiveness of Natural Language\nAugmented Prompt\nIn order to understand the beneﬁt of natural lan-\nguage augmented prompt, we focus on analyzing\nthe examples where the description augmented\nmodel correctly tracks the dialogue state while the\nunaugmented one fails. Based on our analysis of\nT5-base model on MultiWOZ 2.2, the most com-\nmon errors are either misses of gold slots or over-\npredictions of irrelevant slots (82.8% of all errors).\nThe remaining error cases are correct slot predic-\ntions with wrong slot values (17.2%).\nWe provide representative examples for which\nthe description augmented system correctly tracks\nthe dialogue states but not the unaugmented one\nin Table 6. In the ﬁrst example, the phrases in\n4944\nDatabase Train Slot Descriptions || Possible Values\narriveby arrival time of the train\ndestination destination of the train|| Birmingham New Street,London Kings Cross, ..., Stevenage\nDialogue History ...

For the second example,\nthe type information in the description implicitly\nguides the model to focus on time-related informa-\ntion leading the correct output of the normalized\ntimeexpression,16:45. Incontrast,themodelwith-\nout descriptions only generates the partial answer\n4:45, ignoring PM. Lastly, \"London Kings Street\"\nis a typographical error in this case. By utilizing\nthe provided possible values included in the slot\ndescriptions, the model is able to generate the cor-\nrect slot value without spelling error, demonstrat-\ning that the natural language augmented prompt\ncansuccessfullyconstrainthemodeloutputandpo-\ntentially provides robustness to the dialogue state\ntracking system.\n5.4 Error Analysis of Natural Language\nAugmented Prompt-based DST\nHere, we further carry out error analyses into the\nnaturallanguageaugmentedprompt-basedT5-base\n4945\nmodel on MultiWOZ 2.2. As shown in Table 7, we\nrandomlysample50turnsandcategorizetheminto\ndiﬀerent types. In summary, there are four types of\nerrors: (i) The most common error type is annota-\ntion error in which the model prediction is actually\ncorrect, which is similar to the ﬁndings of (Zhou\nand Small, 2019).(ii)20% of the errors come from\nmodel failing to capture information provided by\nthe system.3 (iii) 16.66% of the errors are caused\nby the model misses of at least one gold slot.(iv)\n10% of the errors are correct slot predictions with\nthe wrong corresponding values. In general, most\nerrors are likely caused by the lack of explicit mod-\neling of user-system interactions.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this work, we propose a simple but eﬀective\ntask-oriented dialogue system based on large-scale\npretrained LM. We show that, by reformulating the\ndialogue state tracking task as prompting knowl-\nedge from LM, our model can beneﬁt from the\nknowledge-rich sequence to sequence T5 model.\nBased on our experiments, the proposed natural\nlanguage augmented prompt-based DST model\nachieve SOTA on MultiWOZ 2.2 and comparable\nperformance on MultiWOZ 2.1 and M2M to recent\nSOTA models. Moreover, ouranalyses provide evi-\ndencethatthenaturallanguagepromptiseﬀectively\nutilized to constrain the model prediction.\nAcknowledgements\nThisresearchwassupportedinpartbyagrantfrom\nAllstate.

We don’t use\nany text or label normalization scripts like (Wu\net al., 2019; Hosseini-Asl et al., 2020).\nFor MultiWOZ 2.1 and 2.2, following many pre-\nvious works(Wu et al., 2019), sincepolice and hos-\npital domains only appear in the training set, we\nexclude them in all our experiments.\nB Descriptions\nWe show the descriptions of M2M and MultiWOZ\n2.1in Table8 and Table9\n4https://huggingface.co/t5-small ,https:\n//huggingface.co/t5-base\n4949\nTable 8: Domain and slot descriptions of M2M used in our experiments.
