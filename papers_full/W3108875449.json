INTRODUCTION \nIn today’s world, electricity is one of the most vital \ncomponents of modern society. The utility of transformers for \npower transmission was invented by Nikole Tesla in 19th \ncentury. From turning on a light bulb to running big factories \nevery machine needs some source to work and the most \nneeded sour ce is electricity. Whether it is transmission or \ndistribution, main component in electric power is \ntransformer. The transformer had been playing an important \nrole at various voltage levels for the interconnected power \nsystem [1]. At some frequency electric al power is \ntransformed is one circuit to others by a static piece of \nequipment recognized as transformer [2]. In transformer, \nelectrical energy is being transferred by magnetic coupling \n \nPublished on October 30, 2020.  \nShabana Urooj, Department of Electrical Engineering, College of \nEngineering, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi \nArabia. \n(e-mail: shabanaurooj ieee.org) \nTanya Singh, Department of Electrical Engineering, School of Engineering, \nGautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, India. \n(e-mail: tstanyasingh26 gmail.com) \nfrom one to other systems in the circuit without any \nrequirement of relative motion within the parts. \nIn the core of transformer, a time-variant magnetic flux can \nbe created by the application of alternating voltage to one \nwinding with the introduction of voltage in another winding, \nas per mutual induction law. Faraday introduced the principle \nof transformer in 1831. An ideal transformer having no losses \nmeans its windings are free from ohmic resistance as well as \nmagnetic leakage is considered as ideal transformer [3]. \nHowever, practically losses occur in the transformer, a s \noutput obtained from the transformation is not as same as the \ninput applied. The law of energy states that “energy cannot \nbe created nor be destroyed but can be transferred from one \nphase to another” and in this transfer of energy, losses occur. \nFrom past it has been noticed that two types of transformers \nhave been in application that is core type and shell type of \ntransformer. Transformers used as power transformers are \none of the major apparatus in the power system [4]. Medium \nand large power transforme rs are very important and vital \ncomponent of electric power systems [5]. Generally, power \ntransformers are significant power devices where \nelectromagnetic phenomena should subsist the severe short \ncircuit current situations [6]. Distribution power transformers \nare also vital equipment of the distribution system, for \ntransfer the electric power by step -up/down voltages in \nsuitability with power distribution system to power \nconsumers or power industry [7]. \nThe condition monitoring of power transformers is of \nexcessive importance while considering the consistency and \nsafety perspective in a dynamic system. Nowadays the \nresearch on motoring of transformers is taking a great phase \nas many sensors are used in this method to check the working \nof transformer components, which can be core/winding type. \nEarlier in 2017, S. Anoop and N. Aufal [8] had proposed \ncriteria for the selection of sensors that are used in advance \nmonitoring systems of the transformer’s winding. Like that \nthe core monitoring system control system can be developed. \nA power transformer fault can lead to severe damage to the \nwhole system itself and its surroundings. As the increasing \nconcern on the transformer, recently in 2018 S. Kittan [9] did \nresearch leading to a discussion abo ut actual HI (Health \nIndex) methods through study. After that, the selection of a \nbetter method has been considered for the transformer. In this \nresearch paper a new material has been designed which led to \nMohammad Amir , Department of Electrical Engineering, Madan Mohan \nMalaviya University of Technology (MMMUT), Gorakhpur, India. \n(corresponding e-mail: md.amir ieee.org)  \nMohd Tariq, Department of Electrical Engineering, ZHCET, Aligarh \nMuslim University, Aligarh, India. \n(e-mail: tariq.ee zhcet.ac.in). \n \n \n@ \n@ \n@ \n@ \nOptimal Design of Power Transformer with Advance \nCore Material using ANSYS Technique  \nShabana Urooj, Tanya Singh, Mohammad Amir and Mohd Tariq \n    EJECE, European Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science \nVol. 4, No. 5, October 2020 \n \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejece.2020.4.5.249   Vol 4 | Issue 5 | October 2020 2 \n \nchange in the working efficiency of the designed transformer. \nSimilarly, new techniques and methods are designed to check \nthe working of upcoming new core material.  \nIn 2019, F. R. Ismagilov [10] developed a core material of \namorphous magnetic material as a new material for the core. \nHere the authors have developed the new transformer rectifier \nunit. Here amorphous is used in transformer core material to \nimprove efficiency. The losses are the main factor also in \ntransformer owning cost [11]. The stability and reliability of \nthe power transformers in power system applications mainly \ndepends on the quality of employed ferrite cores [12]. Here, \ntransformer core plays an important role in the working \nefficiency of transformer. New designing of core material has \nadded an advantage of analyzing the working effici ency of \ntransformer. Although the efficiency of power transformers \nfor high-power convention, there are substantial quantities of \npower losses, that radiates heat inadequately into the ambient \nair [13], [14]. \nImprovement in the efficiency of transformer ca n be done \nby deducing electrical losses (P T) comprising of both core \n(PCORE) and copper losses (P CU) presenting in the following \nequation. \n \n𝑃𝑇 = 𝑃𝐶𝑂𝑅𝐸 + 𝑃𝐶𝑈                     (1) \n𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 (դ) =\n𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡\n𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 + 𝑃𝑇 × 100%         (2) \n \nIn our proposed methodology, we are focusing on the \nlosses occurring in the core which have to be minimized for \nimproving three phase core type transformers. The reason is \nthat while designing transformers main consideration should \nbe focused on core losses as it comprises 70% of total losses \nin the transformer [15]. In this paper for the designing and \ncomparison, purpose ANSYS electronics desktop software \nhas been used. This software is a global platform, which \nprovides opportunity for the simulation of various power \nsystem, power electronics components for the field of \nelectrical engineers [16]. The whole simulation has been \nperformed in 3D. The reason is that most parameters directly \naffects the performances of transformer that can be seen in \nthe 3D simulation [17]. Generally, inner structure parts of the \ntransformer analysis are unpredictable and based on the \nelectric field distribution in inner structure transformer [18] \nonly specify 2D models. Therefore, these are the reasons why \nsimulation is better in 3D rather than 2D simulation. \nSection II of the manuscript contains the beginning of the \nidea with thoughtful procedure of introduction followed with \nexplanation of methodology and the proposed model with \nmaterial description of the completely generaliz ed system \nwith its parameters. Section III, this section presents the \noutcome of the results in a tabular manner with different \nresults applied for the various designs simulated in the \nsoftware. Last section includes conclusion, also presents the \nmaterial optimization for future scope and the research work \ncan be achieved further based on feasibility. \n \n \nII. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED SYSTEM  \nA. Material Design for Power Transformers \nThe transformer designed in the software is a core type of \ntransformer in which windings are wounded around all cores \nof the transformer. The following is the design of the \nproposed model.  \n \n \nFig. 1. Proposed model of the core type transformer designed in ANSYS. \n \nHere, in the given Fig. 1, the transformer is a three -phase \nmodel which works in transient system. The voltage phases \nare cosine in nature. This figure depicts all three axis and \ndimensions x, y and z. The excitation in windings is applied \nin x-z direction. The yellow color symbolizes the core, and \nthe green ones are windings wounded on the core of the \nfollowing are the system terminologies used: \na) Region: It is the confined box which is designed in all \nthree dimensions. It is used to provide an environment for the \ntransformer to work desired medium. (value used region: 40, \n250 and 40). \nb) Transient system: The transient system has been taken \nto ensure the working of the transformer with varying voltage \nin all three phases. \nc) Coil terminal: The terminals of coil have been selected \nto provide excitation in the coil terminal.  \nd) Materials used: The material used for the following are \ngiven below: \n• For core: The material used in the core of the proposed \nmodel of the transformer is based on the parameters \ntaken with B -H curve and Core loss curve. Here the \nmaterial is termed as Mo.Me 6. Also, iron has been used \nto compare the working of the transformer. \n• For winding : The copper material has been selected \nhere because it's a good material used in the winding \nsection and has been in use for achieving better \nperformance. \ne) Standard parameters: The following are the  \nparameters, which have been used in the designing of the \ncore transformer. \n• VPeak: Peak voltage of the transformer. \n• R: Resistance of the winding terminal. \n• Rating: The values of rating are taken accordingly for  \ndifferent applications. \nf) Conductivity: Conductivity is referred as to the degree \n\n    EJECE, European Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science \nVol. 4, No. 5, October 2020 \n \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejece.2020.4.5.249   Vol 4 | Issue 5 | October 2020 3 \n \nat which in a material there is a cause of flow of current that \nis it conducts electricity [19]. It is the ratio of current density \nto the electric field, in. which there is a flow of current in the \nmaterial. Here it is taken as (e6) or 1000,000 Siemens/m. \n \n  \nFig. 2. Energy band diagram of Mo.Me6. \n \nThe rise in the temperature of transformer is affected by the \nthermal resistance of transferring heat from conductor to \nambient air, while for consideration of transformer design, \nmaterial properties like dielectric and mechanical properties \nare placed on topmost priority. But here other parameters are \nconsidered as because electrical conductivity is playing an \nimportant role in the designing application. \ng) Mass density:  The mass density has been changed \naccordingly in the designing form based on requireme nts, \nwhere: \n• Conductivity: 100,000 Siemens/m. \n• B-H curve: for this curve, following conditions are there \nwhich are observable in Fig. 3,  \n➢ If Yes: This means the B-H Curve is nonlinear.  \n➢ If No: This means the curve is linear. \nWhere, magnetic flux density (B) is in tesla and H is in \nampere/meter. The nonlinear curve shows that the material \ntaken has nonlinear characteristics of which for every point \nthe plot has been calculated.  \n \n \nFig. 3. Nonlinear B-H curve for iron material. \n \nThe distorting or harmonics observed in induced currents \nare also because of different changeable core material values \nfor the transformer based on the B-H curve [20]. \nCore loss tab : This tab shows the graph obtained when \nstandard parameters taken accordingly in the designi ng of \ncore material [21]. Consideration of core loss unit is in w/kg. \nThe designing and the process pattern of core loss curve has \nbeen explained in Fig. 4, by the flowchart. \n \n \nFig. 4. Core loss tab curve of the core material. \n \nAbove Fig. 4, represents th e curve between B (magnetic \nflux density) vs P (power of transformer). The red one shows \nthe curve obtained from table in the given Fig. 4. The blue \nline shows the variables which are dependent on the function \nof predictor that is showing the error term (w hich is the \nvariable in a based statically data showing relationship \nbetween dependent variables and approximate variables), \nalso it can be said that this line is showing the regression \ncurve trace. \nh) Winding voltages:  \n• For Phase I:  \n𝑉𝑃𝑒𝑎𝑘.

These phenomena are \ndemonstrated through flowchart in Fig.4 as follows: \n• Stage 1 : From starting the selection of core loss \nfrequency the steps follows to selection of parameters. \n• Stage 2 : Then values of proposed model are selected. \nThey can be based on the utility and working conditions. \n• Stage 3: The graph automatically calculates the values \nof the mentioned error constants and curve of required core \nmaterial is plotted. \n• Stage 4: The selection of characteristics of B -H curve \nfollows the selection of the behavior of core material. \n• Stage 5 : Hence, core material properties are defined \nsignificantly. In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 both curves are given with \ntheir properties, which are depicted as in the Fig. 5.

Diagram of transformer core depicting the energy density. \n \nFig. 7. Diagram of transformer depicting the magnetic flux density field \non the core (referred from Table 2). \n \nIn equation (4), B is magnetic flux density in Tesla (T), μ \nis the permeability of core material and H is the magnetic flux \nintensity Ampere/meter (A/m), Ф is magnetic flux in Weber \n(Wb) and A is area of surface of the core in meter2 (𝑚2). From \nthe Fig.7 and Fig. 9 using the equation 4 the following \nconclusion is made that the material Mo.Me 6 has more flux \ndensity than iron. Which state s that if B will be greater then \nautomatically permeability of core material will be greater, \nand the area of surface of core will be lesser, which means \nless space required by the core and small size of the \ntransformer. \n𝐵 = 𝜇.

Hence, the core \nmaterial required will be used in lesser quantity. Thus, cost \nand size of the transformer required will be low. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    EJECE, European Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science \nVol. 4, No. 5, October 2020 \n \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejece.2020.4.5.249   Vol 4 | Issue 5 | October 2020 5 \n \nk) For Iron core material: \n \nFig. 8.

SIMULATION RESULT ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS \nA. Performance Evolution of Different Core Materials \nThe results which are depicted in the tabular format with \ncomparative analysis, based on the performance and the \nchanging parameters, defines the working efficiency of the \ncore transformer.  \nFrom the Table 3 and Table 4 some comparative analysis \ncan be made which are as follows: \n• If B -H Curve is linear then the losses are minimized \notherwise a nonlinear B -H characteristics core material \nincreases the losses. \n• By decreasing the winding resistance, the losses can be \nseen increasing. \n• By decreasing the mass density and thickness of the core \nmaterial the losses seems to be decreasing. \n• In table 3 it is observed that for the material Mo.Me6 less \nlosses occured  compared to iron by changing core \nmaterial.For small rating transformers for Mo.Me 6 \nmaterial losses occured  5 times less than iron when \nlinear characteristics of B-H curve were present. \n• For the instance (3) the no. of coil terminals are 70.

CONCLUSIONS  \nIn our proposed methodology, the optimal design of core \ntype power transformer and their performance analysis have \nbeen done. The calculation of losses parameters was \nemployed that able to analyse the working of transformer in \nvarying conditions whether th ey are associated with core \nparameters, ratings etc. There is an advantage of using the \nANSYS software that it allows the user to change the working \nenvironment medium according to the need of the consumer. \nAlso, toroidal transformers can be utilized for l ow frequency \npower applications as in the applications related to power \nelectronics. The toroidal transformers are at common ly used \nwhere components volume or weight is at priority. AI based \nmonitoring of transformer components is also a better method \nof application. AI based on-line monitoring is a tool that can \nassess the state of these valued assets in real time. Doping of \ncore material opens up an opportunity for more distinct and \nvaried results. But their working  age and error generation \ncannot be predicted in this software. It can be use as the future \nwork and opportunity to discuss these parameters by using AI \ntechniques. As it will be more advent  in the performance \nanalysis using artificial neural networks approach that can be \nused to train the requi red left parameters. In this study, by \nreducing no -load losses, then overall efficiency can be  \nincreased which will enhance the life of power transformer. \nManufacturer of the power transformer can experimentally \nimplement the Mo.Me 6 core material than othe r core \nmaterials for a lesser amount of losses with the help of finite \nelement method. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] H.
