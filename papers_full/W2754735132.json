    "abstract": "To achieve an effective feature extraction for power transformer vibration signals, the authors propose a method for signal feature extraction based on empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and multiscale entropy (MSE). First, transformer vibration signals are decomposed into several empirical wavelet functions (EWFs) with the method of EWT. Then, the frequency characteristics of signals are demonstrated in the time‐frequency representation by applying a Hilbert transform to each EWF component. Finally, in order to quantify the extracted features, the MSEs of components being highly correlated with the original signals are calculated to construct the eigenvectors of transformer vibration signals. Several experiments are presented showing the effectiveness of this method compared with the classic empirical mode decomposition method.",
