It is necessar y to \nenhance speed, sensitivity and accuracy of operation o f \ndifferential protection. A differential relay is base d on the \ndifference between current of low voltage and high \nvoltage of the transformer. In normal operation mod e, \nthere is no significant differential current but whil e an \ninternal fault occurs, the differential current will i ncrease. \nThus increase the differential current can be used as a \nsign of the internal fault. But occurrence of some ph enol-\nmena such as inrush current, over excitation, saturat ion \nof current transformers and mismatch of current trans-\nformers cause the differential current increase and th e \ndifferential relay operates incorrectly. Therefore the use \nof digital differential protection methods is develo ped in \nrecent decades. These methods improve reliability, \nflexibility and performance of differential relay. \nSome of the advanced digital algorithms that fully utilize \nthe computational power of the digital relay (Kaszten ny \nand Kezunovic, 1988; Habib and Marin, 2002) include: \nFourier based methods (Rahman  and  Jeyasurya, 1988), \n \n \n \n*Corresponding author. E-mail: m.ahmadi@jouybariau.ac.ir .  \nKalman filter techniques (Murty and Smolinski, 1988; \nMurty and Smolinski, 1990), flux-restrained current-\ndifferential relay (Phadke and Thorp, 1983), \nmicroprocessor-based relay (Sidhu et al., 1990) and opti-\nmal state observers (Murty et al., 1988). Some meth ods \npropose to use an adaptive scheme for protection of \npower transformers (Girgis et al., 1992).  \nThe concept of inverse inductance utilizing both voltage \nand current information has been suggested (Inagaki e t \nal., 1988; Sidhu and Sachdev, 1992).  Faster and mor e \nreliable protection algorithms can be achieved by \napplying several elaborated protection principles together \n(Wiszniewski and Kasztenny, 1992). However conflicts \nmay arise in doubtful cases; some criteria may recogni ze \nfor example the inrush current, while others may supp ort \nthe occurrence of internal fault. \nThe problem addressed in this paper is how to resolv e \nsuch conflict. Recently, the methods that have differen t \nstructures in comparison other methods have been \ndeveloped and improve speed and sensitivity of the \nprotection. These methods of the protection are arti ficial \nneural network (Segatto and Coury, 2006; Pihler et al ., \n1997) and fuzzy logic (Wiszniewski and Kasztenny, 1995, \n1993). \nIn  this  paper,  fuzzy  logic  is  used  for  internal  fault detection \n \n \n \n \nin differential protection of power transformers. In  this \nmethod of protection, algorithm of fault detection is based \non ruled out non-internal fault phenomena. For inte rnal \nfault detection are considered some criteria for inrus h \ncurrent, over excitation, saturation of current transformers \nand mismatch of current transformers and are defined \nappropriate membership functions and criteria signal s. \nThis algorithm for protection of power transformers  is \ndescribed followed by a test system.   \n \n \nTHE CRITERIA OF NON-FAULT PHENOMENA \nDETECTION IN DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFORMER \nPROTECTION BASED ON FUZZY METHOD \n \nFor detection of non-fault phenomena according to the  \nfeatures will be used varied criteria and will be de fined \nappropriate membership functions and criteria signals. \n \n \nThe inrush current case \n \nInrush current has different features. For detection of \ninrush current, different criteria have been developed. \n \n \nCriterion 1: The value of the differential current is \nhigher than the highest expected inrush current level \n \nComparing differential current caused by inrush current  \nand differential current caused by internal fault show s \nthat the value of differential current caused by inter nal \nfault is higher than differential current level cause d by \ninrush current in some cases. Thus this criterion can b e \nused for inrush current detection. For measuring this  \ncriterion, criteria signal is defined as follows: \n \n) )(), (max( )( 11 ninIn ∆∆=θ   \n \n)(1 nI ∆ - the amplitude of the n-th fundamental harmonic of \ndifferential current and )(ni∆  - the amplitude of the n-th \nsampling instance differential current.    \nFigure 1 shows the membership function that is defined \nfor this case. \n \n \nCriterion 2: During the last half cycle, no sudden \nchange of the voltage amplitude was observed \n \nOne of the features of the inrush current is that the inrush \ncurrent was always caused by sudden change of the volt-\nage amplitude (energizing the transformer). Therefo re, \nmeasuring the changes of voltage amplitude can be \nuseful for inrush current detection. \nFor measuring this criterion, criteria signal is defined as \nfollows:  \nRad et al.          6151 \n \n \n \n) 4 /(\n)()(2\nmnV\nnVn −=θ  \n \nn is present sampling instance and m is the number o f \nsamples per cycle. \nThe membership function is shown in Figure 1a for th is \ncase. \n \n \nCriterion 3: During the last cycle, no sudden chang e \nof the through current amplitude was observed \n \nStudying the differential current caused by inrush curre nt \nand the differential current caused by internal fault shows \nthat the differential current caused by internal fault  does \nnot change with time, but the differential current cau sed \nby internal fault has considerable changes. \nFor measuring this criterion, criteria signal is defined as \nfollows: \n \n)(\n)()(3\nmnI\nnIn\nR\nR\n−=θ  \n  \nFigure 1a presents the membership function for this case. \n \n \nCriterion 4: The second harmonic in the differentia l \ncurrent is below 10% of its fundamental \n \nAnother important feature for inrush current detectio n is \nthe second harmonic of the differential current. This \ncriterion is used in classic relays as a restrained crit erion \nfor inrush current detection. \nFor measuring this criterion, criteria signal is defined as \nfollows:  \n \n)(\n)()(\n1\n2\n4\nnI\nnIn\n∆\n∆=θ  \n \nThe membership function is shown in Figure 1a for t his \ncase. \n  \n \nCriterion 5: The wave shapes of the differential \ncurrent shows certain fragments when the level of \nthe current is close to zero \n \nComparing the wave shape of the differential current  \ncaused by inrush current with differential current cause d \nby internal fault shows that the differential current caused \nby inrush current remains near zero (lasting no less t han \n1/6 of a cycle) while the level of the current is clos e to \nzero. Therefore, comparing these two parameters can \nalso be used to relay decision making. \n6152          Int. J. Phys.

In fuzzy method, there are a number of  \ncriteria which are being used to differentiate betwee n a \nfault and non-internal fault cases. In this method, the \nsymptoms qualify a case to the group \"internal fault\" with \nthe membership function \nµ . If µ  is zero, it is certainly no \ninternal fault. If µ  = 1, it is certainly an internal fault. If \n0< µ <1 it is a doubtful case. Fuzzy method became a \nvery powerful mathematical tool to solve this proble m. \nWith reference to the protection flow  chart  (Figure  2)  at  \nRad et al.          6155 \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3.  The test system with the protected transformer. \n \n \n \nfirst relaying signals are measured and then criteri a \nquantities are computed. The aggregation of membership \nfunction \n),..., ( 13 1 µµ  gives the fuzzy output for each \nnon-fault phenomena. The tripping signal is obtaine d by \ndefuzzyfication of final fuzzy output using a constant \nthreshold. \nThe operation performed after detecting a significant  \nvalue of the differential current is to compute the cr iteria \nsignals and to compare them with their settings in o rder \nto obtain the levels of satisfaction for all the criteria. \nIn fuzzy method for non-fault phenomena detection \nmulti-criteria system is used. In this method, the fa ult \ndetection is based on ruled out non-internal fault cas es. \nThere are differences between the quality of criteria  of \nnon-fault phenomena. Some criteria may be more reliable \nthan others. For the proper use of all these criteri a, \nweighting factors are defined. Weighting factors descr ibe \nthe strength of the criteria. Thus for each non-fault  \nphenomena is obtained final fuzzy output. The \naggregation of (membership functions of the fuzzy setting \nfor relevant criteria) must be performed for each gro up of \ncriteria separately, so that the supports for the cor re-\nsponding aspects of transformer operation are obtained. \nIf the relay detects the differential current, before  \nmaking a trip decision, the relay ought to rule out the non-\nfault cases:  \n \n \nInrush current ruled out \n \n∑\n=\n=\n++++=\n5\n1\n55443322111\n1\n)()()()()()(\nk\nkw\nnwnwnwnwnwn µµµµµω\n \n \nwhere: 51,..., ww - weighting factors describing the strength. \nThe criterion 1,…, criterion 5 used to exclude the inr ush \ncurrent case (The strength of criteria determines the \nvalue of the weighting factors) and 51,..., \nµµ - levels of \nsatisfaction for the criterion 1,…, criterion 5. \nOver excitation ruled out \n \n∑\n=\n=\n++=\n8\n6\n8877662\n1\n)()()()(\nk\nkw\nnwnwnwn µµµω\n \n \n \nSaturation of the CTs ruled out \n \n∑\n=\n=\n++=\n11 \n9\n11 11 10 10 993\n1\n)()()()(\nk\nkw\nnwnwnwn µµµω\n \n \n \nMismatch of the CTs ruled out \n \n∑\n=\n=\n+=\n13 \n1\n13 13 12 12 4\n1\n)()()(\nk\nkw\nnwnwn µµω\n \n \nInternal fault hypothesis means that all the cases have to \nbe ruled out.
