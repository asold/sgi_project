The phase -transition behavior of \nthe transformable Eu(III) coordination polymer was characterized using differential scanning \ncalorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. The Eu(III) coordination polymer exhibit ed a phase-\ntransition at approximately 180 °C. The magnitude of the CPL intensity was drastically changed \nbecause of the phase-transition, without coordination geometrical change around the Eu(III) ion. \nIn this study, the orientation effect of a chiral Eu(III) coordination polymer on the C PL \nproperties in crystalline solid is demonstrated.  \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nChiral luminophores , such as organic molecules, transition metal complexes, and lanthanide \ncomplexes, exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). 1–3 Recently, CPL has attracted \nattention for the development of security tags, three- dimensional displays, and bio-imaging \napplications.4–12 The magnitude of the dissymmetry factor of CPL ( gCPL) is defined by the \nfollowing equation:2,11 \n𝑔𝑔CPL = 2(𝐼𝐼L −𝐼𝐼R)\n𝐼𝐼L + 𝐼𝐼R\n,     (1) \nwhere IL and IR are the intensities  of the left - and right -handed circularly polarized light, \nrespectively. The gCPL value depends on the electronic transition s of the luminescent molecule. \nIn particular, chiral Eu(III) complexes exhibit relatively large g CPL values (gCPL >10−1) compared \nwith chiral organic molecules and transition metal complexes ( gCPL = 10 −1 ~ 10 −4).6,9–15 Their \ncharacteristically large gCPL values are based on the combination of the magnetic dipole \ntransition in 4f orbitals and the formation of chiral steric and electronic structures induced by the \norganic ligands.  \nA series of  Eu(III) complexes with chiral organic ligands , such as camphor, Pybox, \nnaphthol, and helicene derivatives have been reported. 4,16–24 The CPL properties of chiral Eu(III) \ncomplexes are closely related to their coordination geometries  and structural strain of ligands . \nYuasa demonstrated that the cis-trans isomerization of the bidentate phosphine oxide ligand in a \nchiral Eu(III) complex leads to CPL sign inversion. 25 We also reported  that a large structural \nstrain of the β -diketonate ligands in chiral Eu(III) complexes prom otes the enhancement of the \nligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition probability and increases the g CPL value.26 \nThese results were mainly caused by the modification of the steric structure around Eu(III) ions. \n \n 4 \nThe helical aggregation of chiral Eu(III) compounds in a solution also influences the magnitude \nof the gCPL value.27 To elucidate the relationship between the molecular orientation and the CPL \nproperties, we focus on the chiral Eu(III) compound with structural transformation in the solid \nstate.  \nHerein, chiral Eu(III) coordination polymers with phase -transition behaviors are \nreported for the evaluation of molecular orientations in crystalline solid s. In molecular designs  \nfor the  thermal phase-transition, a flexible transformation ability and a thermostable rigid \nstructure of Eu(III) coordination compounds  are required. Eu(III) coordination polymers exhibit \ntight stacking structures of one -dimensional polymer chains in the crystal, resulting in  the \nformation of thermostable properties (decomposition temperature >  300 °C).28–30 We also found \nthat the ethynyl groups of the linker ligands in Eu(III ) coordination polymers exhibit phase-\ntransition behavior in the solid state.31,32 \nIn this study, chiral Eu(III) coordination polymers with  ethynyl groups in the linker \nligands, [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n and [Eu(+tfc) 3(p-dpeb)]n, were prepared by the reaction of \n[Eu(+tfc)3(H2O)2] with m - or p-dpeb (Figure 1a, +tfc: (+) -3-trifluoroacetylcamphorato, m-dpeb: \n1,3-bis(diphenylphosphorylethynyl)benzene, p-dpeb: 1,4-\nbis(diphenylphosphorylethynyl)benzene). The coordination polymers  are composed of Eu(III) \nions, chiral camphorate ligands (+tfc), and m- or p-linked phosphine oxide ligands , including \nethynyl groups ( m-dpeb or p- dpeb). The o-linked ethynyl ligand ( o-dpeb: 1,2-\nbis(diphenylphosphorylethynyl)benzene) provides a mononuclear Eu(III) complex [Eu(+tfc) 3(o-\ndpeb)] ( SI: Figure S 7). The phase -transition behavior of Eu(III) coordination polymers was \ncharacterized using thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and \npowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The chiral Eu(III) coordination polymer , [Eu(+tfc)3(m-\n \n 5 \ndpeb)]n, exhibit phase-transition behavior without changes in the coordination geometry (see \nFigure 1b for images of Type -A and Type -B), although [Eu(+tfc) 3(p-dpeb)]n has no phase -\ntransition temperature. The phase -transition of [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n leads to a considerable \nchange in the CPL signal intensity  without a spectral shape change in the emission. \nTransformable chiral Eu(III) coordination polymer ha s been demonstrated for understanding the \norientation effect on CPL properties in solid systems. \n \n \nFigure 1. a) Chemical structures of [Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n, [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n, and [Eu(+tfc)3(o-\ndpeb)]. b) Schematic image of phase-transition in [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n. \n \n  \n\n \n 6 \nExperimental Section \nGeneral methods: All chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. \nFourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-4600 spectrometer. \nESI-MS spectra were measured using a JEOL JMS -T100LP. Elemental analyses were performed \non an Exeter Analytical CE440. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 31P NMR (16 2 MHz) spectra were \nrecorded on a JEOL ECS400 at 298 K. Tetramethylsilane (δH = 0.00 ppm) and phosphoric acid \n(δP = 0.00 ppm) were used as internal references  for 1H and 31P NMR, respectively. DSC was \nperformed on a Hitachi High- Tech DSC 7020 under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of \n5 °C min–1. TG analysis was performed on a Hitachi High -Tech TG/DTA6300 analyzer under  \nnitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5  °C  min–1. Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data \nwere acquired using a large Debye–Scherrer camera installed at the SPring -8 BL02B2 beamline, \nemploying an auto sampler with a multiple MYTHEN detector. 33 The wavelength of the incident \nX-ray was 0.800168 Å , which was calibrated using a cerium oxide standard powder sample by \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology. Temperature-dependent X -ray \ndiffractometry was performed on a Rigaku SmartLab using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). \n \nPreparation of 1,3- bis(diphenylphosphorylethynyl)benzene (m-dpeb): m-dpeb was prepared \nwith the procedure described in a previous report.31 The 1,3-diethynylbenzene (1.0 g, 7.9 m mol) \nwas dissolved in dry diethyl ether (50 mL), and the mixture was degassed by Ar bubbling. A \nsolution of n- BuLi (ca. 1.6 mol  L–1, 12 mL, 19 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution at \n−80 °C. The mixture was allowed to stir for 3.5 h at −10 °C, after which \nchlorodiphenylphosphine (3.5 mL, 19 mmol) was added dropwise at −80 °C. The mixture was \ngradually brought to room temperature and stirred for 19 h. The reaction mixture was poured into \n \n 7 \ndistilled water and  extracted with dichloromethane. The extracts were washed with brine three \ntimes and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was evaporated, and the obtained yellow oil \nwas placed with dichloromethane (10 mL) in a flask. The solution was cooled to 0 °C, and then \nan aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide solution (10 mL) was added dropwise to the above solution. \nThe solution was stirred for 3 h. After separation of aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, t he \nsolution was washed with distilled water. Anhydrous MgSO4 was added to the organic phases for \ndehydration. After filtration, the organic phase was evaporated to give a white powder. The \npowder was recrystallized from methanol s olution to give prism crystals.

Emission \ndecay profiles were measured using the third harmonics (355 nm) of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser \n(Spectra P hysics, INDI -50, FWHM = 5 ns, λ = 1064 nm) and a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu \nPhotonics, R5108, response time ≤ 1.1 ns). The Nd:YAG laser response was monitored with a \ndigital oscilloscope (Sony Tektronix, TDS3052, 500 MHz) synchronized to the single -pulse \nexcitation. Emission lifetimes were determined from the slope of logarithmic plots of the decay \nprofiles. Emission lifetimes in the range of 100 to 350 K were measured by using a cryostat \n(Thermal Block Company, SA-SB245T) and a temperature controller (Oxford, Instruments, ITC \n502S). CPL spectra were recorded on a JASCO CPL -300 spectro-fluoropolarimeter for Eu(III) \ncomplexes (0.5 mg) mixed with KBr (150 mg). Tablets (diameter: 10 mm, Eu(III) complexes  / \nKBr) were prepared using a PT-10 tablet forming machine (48.2 kN, press time: 3 min). \n \nComputational Details: All q uantum chemical calculations were performed by the density \nfunctional theory (DFT) with the long- range and dispersion corrected ωB97X-D functional 34 \nusing the Gaussian 16 package .35 The spin -unrestricted self -consistent field calculations were \nperformed. Excited states were investigated using time -dependent (TD)-DFT. The Stuttgart RSC \n1997 (ECP28MWB)36,37 basis set was adopted for Eu atoms, while the cc- pVDZ basis set38 was \nused for the other atoms. \n  \n \n 10 \nResults and Discussion \nStructural characterizations \nChiral Eu(III) coordination polymers with ethynyl linkers, [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n and \n[Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n, were synthesized by complexation of m -dpeb and p- dpeb with \n[Eu(+tfc)3(H2O)2] in a methanol solution, respectively. The formation of the coordination \npolymers was characterized using FT -IR and ESI -MS spectroscop y. The FT -IR spectra of m -\ndpeb, [Eu(+tfc)3(H2O)2], and [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n are shown in Figure S5a  (SI). The precursor \n[Eu(+tfc)3(H2O)2] shows significant O -H stretching vibrational signals for coordinated water at \napproximately 3,400 cm −1. The disappearance of O -H stretching vibrational signals was \nobserved in the IR spectrum of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n. The disappearance of coordinated water in \np-linked [Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n was also confirmed (SI: Figure S5b).  \nThe ESI-MS spectra and simulated mass patterns of [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n are shown in \nFigure 2. The observed signals with mass numbers ( m/z) of 1173.2, 2592.5, 4013.8, and 5434.1 \nwere assigned to the fragments of [Eu(+tfc) 2(m-dpeb)]+, [Eu2(+tfc)5(m-dpeb)2]+, [Eu3(+tfc)8(m-\ndpeb)3]+, and [Eu 4(+tfc)11(m-dpeb)4]+, respectively. A ssignments were made by comparing the \nobserved isotope distribution of [Eu n(+tfc)3n-1(m-dpeb)n]+ (m/z at approximately 1173.2, 2592.5, \n4013.8, and 5434.1) with the calculated data. The observed ESI -MS signals of p- linked \n[Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n were also assigned to fragments of [Eun(+tfc)3n-1(p-dpeb)n]+ (SI: Figure S6).  \n \n \n 11 \n \nFigure 2.

Although the elimination of coordinated water in the precursor \n[Eu(+tfc)3(H2O)2] was observed at approximately 90 °C , the decomposition temperatures (Td) of \n[Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n and [Eu(+tfc) 3(p-dpeb)]n were 306 and 298 °C, respectively (Figure 3a). \nThe high decomposition temperatures of [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n and [Eu(+tfc) 3(p-dpeb)]n are \nsimilar to those of previously reported chiral lanthanide coordination polymers (Td ˃ 300 ℃).16,20 \n \n\n \n 12 \n \nFigure 3. a) TG and b) DSC thermograms of  [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n (red line), [Eu(+tfc) 3(p-\ndpeb)]n (black line), and [Eu(+tfc) 3(H2O)2] (blue line) in  a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating and \ncooling rate of 5 °C min−1. \n \nPXRD patterns of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n at various temperatures are shown in Figure 4a. \nThe characteristic peaks at 2θ = 7.5 °, 8.0°, 8.4°, 11.0°, 12.9°, 14.3°, 15.0°, 15.3°, 19.3°, 20.2°, \nand 20.8° were observed under 160 °C (Type-A). We also observed drastic changes in the PXRD \npatterns of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n at 2θ = 7.9°, 9.1°, 15.1°, 19.9°, and 20.4° at 180 °C, which were \nrelated to the phase- transition behavior. The peaks disappeared due to the melting of the Eu(III) \ncoordination polymer at 200 °C . \n\n \n 13 \n \n \nFigure 4. a) PXRD patterns of  [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n in the temperature range of 30–200 °C. b) \nSynchrotron PXRD patterns of  [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n measured at 23 °C after the heat-treatment \n(black line: Type-A; red line: Type-B). \n \n\n \n 14 \nBased on the DSC measurements, characteristic endothermic peaks corresponding to the \nphase-transition and melting phenomena  of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n were observed at 192 °C \n(Figure 3b).  In the DSC thermogram expanded the region at 130–200 °C, the transformation \nbehavior is making slow progress (SI: Figure S8). A significant endothermic peak of  \n[Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n was not visible. These results indicate that [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n exhibits \nthree stable structures (Type-A, Type-B, and melting states) depending on the temperature. \nTo confirm the stable structure of the coordination polymer  at room temperature,  \nsynchrotron PXRD measurements of  [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n were performed after heat -treatment \n(Figure 4b). The PXRD patterns of phase- transformed [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n after heat-treatment \nat 180 °C for 30 min and rapid cooling (Type -B) agreed with th ose obtained under heating \n(Figure 4a; at 180 °C). The Type-B structure of [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n was maintained in air at \nroom temperature.  The additional PXRD measurements were conducted to check the stable \nstructure of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n after heating at 200 °C (melting state) and cooling. The PXRD \npatterns of the coordination polymer after heat -treatment at 200 °C and rapid (c.a. 100 °C m in−1, \nType-C) or slow (c.a. 1 °C min −1, Type -D) cooling are shown in Figure S9 (SI). The PXRD \npatterns of Type-C (rapid cooling from 200 °C) agreed with those of Type-B (rapid cooling from \n180 °C). On the other hands, the PXRD patterns of  Type -D (slow cooling from 200 °C) showed \npresence of phase A and B. This result indicates that the structural phase of Type -B was \nmetastable and partially transformed back into phase A. \n The PXRD patterns of p- linked [Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n were not transformed in the heat -\ntreatment below the decomposition temperature ( SI: Figure S10). We successfully prepared the \norientation-change Type-A and Type -B samples of [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n based on the phase -\ntransition. \n \n 15 \n \nPhotophysical properties \nThe excitation and emission spectra of Type-A at room temperature are shown in Figure 5a. The \nsharp excitation bands at 464, 525, and 534 nm are attributed to the 4f -4f transitions of Eu(III) \n(5D2←7F0, 5D1←7F0, and 5D1←7F1).39 The broad excitation bands  are attributed to the π -π* \ntransitions in the organic ligands. The emission bands at 578, 590, 612, 652, and 700 nm are \nattributed to the 4f -4f transitions of Eu(III) ( 5D0→7FJ : J = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) .39 The emission \nspectra of Type-A and Type-B expanded in the region of 5D0→7F0,1 and 5D0→7F2 transitions are \nshown in Figure 5b and 5c, respectively. The spectral shape with Stark splitting at the magnetic \ndipole transition (5D0→7F1) and electric dipole transition ( 5D0→7F2) of Type-A agreed with that \nof Type -B. The agreement between the transition bands  reveals that  the geometrical structure \naround the Eu(III) center in Type-A is the same as that in Type-B. \n \n \n 16 \n \nFigure 5. a) Excitation (black, λem = 612 nm) and emission spectra (red, λex = 360 nm) of Type-A \nmeasured at room temperature;  b), c) Emission spectra (λ em = 612 nm) of Type -A (black) and \nType-B (red) expanded the region of 5D0→7F0,1 and 5D0→7F2 transitions, respectively. d) \nSchematic image of two emission sites of Eu(III) coordination polymer. \n \nThe time -resolved emission decay profiles obtained for Type -A an d -B at room \ntemperature are shown in Figure S11 (SI). Double-exponential decays with sub-millisecond scale \nlifetimes were observed. The multi-exponential decay might arise from the two emission sites of \nthe Eu(III) ion (Figure 5d), which is a common behavior in inorganic phosphor s including \nlanthanide ions .40 The emission lifetimes and their ratios were estimated using an exponential \n\n \n 17 \nfunction (Table 1). The shorter lifetime ( τ2) may be due to non- radiative relaxation via the \nLMCT quenching process. That LMCT quenching process often occurs in chiral Eu(III) \ncomplexes with camphor ligands .12,41 The average emission lifetime  ( τave) of Type-B (270 μs ) \nwas slightly longer than that of Type -A (253 μs).  Based on the emission lifetime and emission \nspectra, the 4f-4f emission quantum yield ( Φf-f), radiative rate constant ( kr), and non- radiative \nrate constant (knr) were estimated using the following equations: \n𝑘𝑘r = 1\n𝜏𝜏rad\n= 𝐴𝐴MD,0𝑛𝑛3 𝐼𝐼tot\n𝐼𝐼MD\n ,           (2) \n𝛷𝛷f-f = 𝑘𝑘r\n𝑘𝑘r + 𝑘𝑘nr\n= 𝜏𝜏obs\n𝜏𝜏rad\n ,                (3) \n𝑘𝑘nr = 1\n𝜏𝜏obs\n− 1\n𝜏𝜏rad\n ,                (4) \nwhere τobs and τrad are the observed and radiative emission lifetimes , respectively. τrad is defined \nas the ideal emission lifetime without a non-radiative process. In these calculations, we used the \nτave value as the τobs unit. The parameter AMD,0, n, and the calculated Itot/IMD are the spontaneous \nemission probability for the 5D0→7F1 transition in vacuo (14.65 s−1), the refractive index of the \nmedium (n = 1.5), and the ratio of the total area of the corrected Eu(III) emission spectrum to the \narea of the 5D0→7F1 band, respectively.42 These photophysical parameters of Type- A and Type-\nB are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 18 \nTable 1.

On \nthe other hand, the k nr value of Type-A (2.88×103 s−1) was larger than that of Type -B (2.64×103 \ns−1). From the temperature -dependent emission lifetime  measurements and kinetic analyses ( SI: \nFigures S12, S13, and S14 and Table S1), the activation energy (ΔEa) and frequency factor (A) of \nthe back energy transfer from Eu(III) to LMCT states  were estimated. The calculated Δ Ea value \nof Type-A (2,200 cm−1) was larger than that of Type -B (1,880 cm−1). The calculated A value of \nType-A (1.1×108 s−1) was almost five times larger than that of Type -B (2.0×107 s−1). The LMCT \nstates of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n is influenced by the change in molecular orientation based on the \nphase-transition. \nThe CPL spectra of the two types of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n (Type-A and Type -B) in the \nsolid state (in KBr pellets ) are shown in Figure  6. Characteristic CPL signals were observed at \napproximately 580–600 ( 5D0→7F1) and 610–620 nm (5D0→7F2). In the magnetic dipole \ntransition ( 5D0→7F1), two significant peaks were observed at 58 6 and 594 nm for each \ncoordination polymer. The intensity of the negative CPL signal in Type-A was larger than that in \nType-B in this region. The maximum |gCPL| value for Type-A (gCPL = −0.092) was three times \nlarger than that for Type-B (gCPL = −0.030). In the electric dipole transition (5D0→7F2), the |gCPL| \n \n 19 \nvalue of Type-A was also larger than that of  Type-B. The significantly large difference in the \n|gCPL| values between Type-A and Type-B might be affected by the molecular orientation of the \npolymer chains. \nTo confirm the effect of molecular orientation on the CPL properties in Eu(III) \ncoordination polymer, we demonstrated amorphization via an  additive phosphine oxide ligand \n(SI: Figures S15 and S16).  After amorphization, amorphized Type -A exhibited a decreasing \n|gCPL| value ( gCPL = −0.076), which agrees  with that for amorphized Type -B ( gCPL = −0.077). \nThese additional experiments indicate d that the gCPL value depends  on the orientation of the \npolymer chains in the solid state. \n \n \nFigure 6. a) CPL and b) g CPL spectra (λex = 350 nm) of [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n measured at room \ntemperature after heat-treatment (in KBr pellet; black line: Type-A; red line: Type-B) \n\n \n 20 \n \nDFT calculations \nRecently, the photophysical and theoretical analys es of the LMCT excited states , which affect \nthe 4f-4f transition probability in Eu(III) complexes , have been focused.43–45 We considered that \nthe chiroptical properties of chiral Eu(III) compounds are also affected by the LMCT transition . \nThus, the transition electric dipole moments of the LMCT states were estimated by TD -DFT \ncalculations to understand the mechanism of the gCPL change under structural transformation. \nThe TD-DFT calculations were performed  using a mononuclear chiral Eu(III) complex with \ncamphor ligands, [Eu(+tfc)3(tppo)2] (tppo: triphenylphosphine oxide) , as a one-unit model.18 A \ndimer model (Eu-Eu distance: dEu-Eu = 12.79 Å) was constructed from the X-ray crystallographic \ndata. The modified structures elongating the Eu-Eu distance of the original dimer model to d Eu-Eu \n= 13, 14, and 15 Å (Figure 7a) were also examined by the TD-DFT calculations.  \n \n \n 21 \n \nFigure 7. a) Molecular structure of Eu(+tfc)3(tppo)2 dimer model. b) Magnitude of transition \nelectric dipole moment vectors (|𝜇𝜇⃗|) in 4f-4f or LMCT excited states. \n \nThe calculated excitation energies and transition assignments are summarized in Tables 2, S2, S3, \nand S4 (SI).

To  \nestimate the quantum mixing between the LMCT and 4f-4f states, we considered the contribution \nof the splitting energy gap (ΔEsplit). The relationship between ΔEsplit and dEu-Eu is shown in Figure \n8b. The large Δ Esplit in short dEu-Eu leads to a small energy gap between the LMCT and 4f -4f \nstates (ΔELMCT-4f in Figure 8a), resulting in a large quantum mixing of the LMCT and 4f-4f states. \nThe images of the molecular orbitals with the largest Δ Esplit (excited states 17 and 18) are shown \nin Figure 8c , where t he characteristic LMCT transitions  (π (+tfc)→4f (Eu)) were observed. \nThese results suggest that the molecular orientation of chiral Eu(III) compounds affects the \nsplitting energy of LMCT state s ( ΔEsplit) and their  quantum mixing (ΔE LMCT-4f), resulting in a \nchange in gCPL because of structural transformation. \n \n \n 24 \n \nFigure 8. a) Energy diagrams of correlations between 4f-4f and LMCT states for monomer and \ndimer model. b) Relationship between splitting energy gap (ΔEsplit) and Eu-Eu distance (dEu-Eu). \nc) Selected α-spin molecular orbitals of Eu(+tfc)3(tppo)2 dimer model (dEu-Eu = 12.79Å). \n  \n\n \n 25 \nConclusions \nNovel chiral Eu(III) coordination polymers, [Eu(+tfc) 3(p-dpeb)]n and [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n, were \nsynthesized. [Eu(+tfc) 3(m-dpeb)]n showed phase -transition behavior at 180 °C, whereas \n[Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n showed no phase -transition behavior. The phase -transition behavior  of \nEu(III) coordination polymers w as depended on the position of the ethynyl groups in the \nphosphine oxide ligands. T he emission spectra (coordination geometrical analys es) and CPL \nmeasurements (chiroptical properties) showed that the dissymmetry factor (gCPL) is related to the \norientation of the polymer chains in the crystalline solid . The photophysical findings  were \nconfirmed by performing quantum chemical calculations. \nFurther control of the orientation of the polymer chains in chiral Eu(III) coordination polymers \ncan improve the | gCPL| value for optical applications such as security tags and three -dimensional \ndisplays. The relationship be tween the molecular orientation and the CPL properties of  chiral \nEu(III) compounds opens up a frontier fields  of coordination chemistry, material science , and \nsolid-state photophysical chemistry.  \n \n 26 \nASSOCIATED CONTENT \nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge. \nSchematic reaction of Eu(III) coordination polymers and complex including ethynyl group in the \nlinker ligand; 1H and 31P NMR spectra; FT-IR spectra; ESI-MS spectra; DSC thermograms and \nPXRD patterns of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n; PXRD patterns of [Eu(+tfc)3(p-dpeb)]n; Emission decay \nprofiles of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n; Temperature-dependent emission lifetimes and Arrhenius plots \nof [Eu(+tfc)3(m-dpeb)]n; PXRD patterns, emission spectra, and gCPL spectra of [Eu(+tfc)3(m-\ndpeb)]n after amorphization (PDF) \n \nAUTHOR INFORMATION \nCorresponding Author \nYasuchika Hasegawa − Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Kita 13, Nishi 8, Kita-ku \nSapporo, Hokkaido 060-8628, Japan; Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery \n(WPI-ICReDD), Hokkaido University, Kita 21, Nishi 10, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 001-0021, \nJapan. \nTel. /Fax: +81-11-706-7114. \nE-mail: hasegaway@eng.hokudai.ac.jp \n \nAuthors \nMakoto Tsurui – Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University, \nKita 13, Nishi 8, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-8628, Japan. \n \n 27 \nYuichi Kitagawa – Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Kita 13, Nishi 8, Kita -ku \nSapporo, Hokkaido 060-8628, Japan; Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discov ery \n(WPI-ICReDD), Hokkaido University, Kita 21, Nishi 10, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 001-0021, \nJapan. \nSunao Shoji – Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Kita 13, Nishi 8, Kita -ku Sapporo, \nHokkaido 060-8628, Japan; Institute for Chemical Reaction De sign and Discovery (WPI -\nICReDD), Hokkaido University, Kita 21, Nishi 10, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 001-0021, Japan. \nHitomi Ohmagari – College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, 5- 10-1 \nFuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5258, Japan. \nMiki Hasegawa – College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, 5- 10-1 \nFuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5258, Japan. \nMasayuki Gon – Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto daigaku- katsura, \nNishikyo-ku, Kyoto 615-8510, Japan. \nKazuo Tanaka – Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto daigaku- katsura, \nNishikyo-ku, Kyoto 615-8510, Japan. \nMasato Kobayashi  – Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita 10, Nishi 8, Kita -ku, \nSapporo, Hokkaido 060-0810, Japan; Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery \n(WPI-ICReDD), Hokkaido University, Kita 21, Nishi 10, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 001-0021, \nJapan. \nTetsuya Taketsugu – Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita 10, Nishi 8, Kita -ku, \nSapporo, Hokkaido 060-0810, Japan; Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery \n \n 28 \n(WPI-ICReDD), Hokkaido University, Kita 21, Nishi 10, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 001-0021, \nJapan. \nKoji Fushimi – Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Kita 13, Nishi 8, Ki ta-ku Sapporo, \nHokkaido 060-8628, Japan. \n \nNotes \nThe authors declare no competing financial interest. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grants Number JP20H02748, JP20H04653, \nJP20H05197, JP20K21201, JP21K18969, JP22K14741, JP17H06374, and JP20K15041 of the \nMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.
