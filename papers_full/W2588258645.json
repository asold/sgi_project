In this application, fault tolerance is\na highly desired feature and it is obtained through redundancy .\nThis paper proposes a reconﬁguration scheme for the SRC for\nthe case of failure in one semiconductor , which could drastically\nreduce the need of redundancy . Using the proposed scheme,\nthe full-bridge based SRC can be reconﬁgured in a half-bridge\ntopology, in order to keep the converter operational even with\nthe failure (open circuit or short circuit) of one switch. The\ntheoretical analysis is carried out for the unidirectional SRC\nand then extended to the bidirectional topology, since bidirec-\ntionality is required in smart transformer application. T o verify\nthe feasibility of the proposed scheme, the converter is tested\nexperimentally in a 700 V to 600 V prototype with 10 kW of\noutput power . A IGBT short-circuit fault is tested and the results\nconﬁrms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nI. I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe series-resonant dc-dc converter (SRC) has been very\nused in wireless power transfer application for electrical ve-\nhicle [1] - [4], battery charger [5] - [6], renewable energy\nsystem [7]- [10] and high voltage power supply for speciﬁc\napplication, such as traveling-wave tube (TWT) for satellite\napplication [11]. Recently , this topology became very popular\nin Smart Transformer (ST) [12]–[15], mainly because of its\ncharacteristic of output voltage regulation in open loop asso-\nciate to its high efﬁciency . Fig. 1 shows a modular architecture\nof the ST using the SRC as a building block of the dc-dc stage.\nIn ST applied in the smart grid context, the continuity\nof operation is of paramount importance [12], [16]. For that\nreason, a highly reliable system (preferable with redundancies)\nis required. The fault tolerant feature contributes to increase\nthe availability of system and several fault tolerance methods\nhave been proposed in literature [17]–[20]. Most of these\nmethods includes a signiﬁcant amount of extra hardware\n(such as semiconductors/leg redundancy [17], [19] or series\nconnection of fuses/switches to isolate the fault [17], [18],\n[20]), increasing the cost and compromising the efﬁciency\nof the system. In this context, this paper proposes a fault\ntolerance solution with minimum of additional hardware and\nno impact on efﬁciency for the SRC converter, using the\nadvantage of inherent fault tolerant capability of this topology .\nThe investigated method have been introduced in [21] for\nthe unidirectional version. However, bidirectional feature is\nFigure 1. Modular Smart Transformer architecture using the Series-Resonant\nconverter as a building block of the dc-dc stage of the system.\nrequired for all converters in ST application and then, the fault\ntolerance method is extended to the bidirectional SRC in this\nwork.\nIndependently from the mechanism, there are two possible\nfailures types for the semiconductor: open-circuit (OC) or\nshort-circuit (SC). According to [22], [23], the reasons that\nimplies a OC failure are: bond-wire lift off or rupture and\nfailure on the gate drive. Meanwhile, the SC failure might be\na result of an overvoltage, static or dynamic latch up, second\nbreakdown or energy shock. Since most of the failures result\nin a SC condition [22], this work focuses on a SRC resilient\nto SC failure.\nThe proposed reconﬁguration scheme consists in re-\nconﬁguring the full-bridge SRC (FB-SRC) in a half-bridge\nSRC (HB-SRC) converter. Nevertheless, the output voltage\ngenerated by the HB-SRC is half of the output generated\nby the FB-SRC, considering the same parameters. There-\nfore, a novel re-conﬁgurable rectiﬁer based on the voltage-\ndoubler topology is proposed in order to keep the same output\nvoltage. The operation principle of the FB-SRC and HB-\nSRC operating in discontinuous conduction mode (dcm) are\npresented in Section II. In Section III, the reconﬁguration\nscheme is described in detail for the unidirectional SRC and\nthe proposed fault-tolerant topology is presented. In section\nIV , the proposed reconﬁguration scheme is extended to the\nbidirectional topology and a bidirectional fault-tolerant SRC\nis proposed. Experimental results are provided in Section V ,\nin order to conﬁrm the theoretical analysis developed in this\npaper. Finally , the conclusion is presented in Section VI.\nII. O P E R AT I O N PR I N C I P L E O F T H E SR C O N V E RT E R\nA. Full-Bridge SRC\nThe topology of the SRC based on full-bridge conﬁguration\n(FB-SRC) is shown in Fig. 1 (a). T o simplify the description,\na unidirectional topology is considered in this analysis and a\ndiode bridge rectiﬁer is used in the secondary side. T o support\nthe analysis, the variables resonant frequency ( fo ), resonant\nangular frequency ( ω 0 ) and characteristic impedance of the\nresonant network ( Z) are deﬁned from (1) to (3), in terms\nof the resonant inductor ( Lr ) and capacitor ( Cr ) of the tank\ncircuit.\nf0 = 1\n2π √LrCr\n(1)\nω 0 = 2π f0 (2)\nZ =\n√\nLr\nCr\n(3)\nFig. 1 (c) shows the main waveforms for the FB-SRC\noperating at the resonant frequency ( fs = fo ) and below\nthe resonant frequency ( fs < fo ), where fs is the switching\nfrequency . For operation below the resonant frequency , the\ncurrent iLr reaches zero before half of the switching period, and\nit remains zero until the primary bridge applies negative output\nvoltage, i.e. vp = −Vi . Since the commutations happen when\niLr = 0, all semiconductors switch at zero-current-switching\n(ZCS), avoiding therefore switching losses. Because of the\nsoft-switching feature, this operation mode, named half-cycle\ndiscontinuous-conduction mode (dcm), is very advantageous\nand it will be considered for the analysis in this work. T o\noperate at half-cycle dcm, the converter parameters must\nsatisfy the following conditions [24]:\nγ = ω 0\n2 fs\n> π (4)\nfs < f0 (5)\nIo < 8 fsCrVo (6)\nwhere, γ is the angular length of one half switching period\nand Io is the load current. From these conditions is possible\nto design Lr and Cr , considering the operation range of the\nconverter.\nThe relation between the amount of charge stored in the\ncapacitor ( ∆ q) and its voltage ( vCr ) is given by (7). During\nthe period 0 < t < T0 (where T0 is the resonant period), the\ncapacitor voltage starts from −VC pk and reaches VC pk (see Fig.\n2 (c)), thus ∆ vCr = 2VC pk . Likewise, the charge that ﬂows\nFigure 2. Series Resonant dc-dc converter: (a) topology of the FB-SRC, (b)\nT opology of the HB-SRC, (c) main waveforms of the FB-SRC and (d) main\nwaveforms of the HB-SRC.\nthrough the capacitor during this period is deﬁned as q, as\nshown in Fig. 2 (c). This relation is described in (8).\n∆ q = C∆ vCr (7)\nq = 2 ·C ·VC pk (8)\nThe instantaneous average value of the input current ( ii ) is\ncalculated by (9). As highlighted in this equation, the integral\nof the current during the time interval 0 to Ts /2 is the charge\naccumulated in the capacitor (see Fig. 2 (c)). Thus, the relation\npresented in (10) is found.\nIi = ⟨i1 (t )⟩T s = 2\nTs\nTs /2∫\n0\ni1 (t )dt\n  \nq\n(9)\nIi = 2 fs q (10)\nReplacing (10) in (8), (11) is obtained, and it can be\nrearranged to obtain the peak voltage on the capacitor in\nfunction of the load (represented in this equation by the input\ncurrent Ii ), switching frequency and capacitance value, as\npresented in (12).\nIi\n2 fs q = 2 ·C ·VC pk (11)\nFigure 3.

Half-Bridge SRC\nBesides the circuit shown in Fig. 1 (a), the series-resonant\ndc-dc converter can be also implemented based on the half-\nbridge topology (HB-SRC), as shown in Fig. 2 (b). This circuit\nbecame well-known in literature as LLC converter, due to the\nconﬁguration of the tank circuit, considering the magnetizing\ninductance of the transformer, and it has been widely used in\ntelecommunications power supply applications. The operation\nof the HB-SRC is very similar to the one of the FB-SRC\nconverter, previously described. Therefore, equations (4) to\n(10) are still valid for the HB-SRC. The difference between\nthese two converters lies on the resonant capacitor voltage\n(which has an offset of Vo in the HB-SRC converter, as shown\nin (14)) and also on the peak-to-peak value of the voltage vp .\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2 (c) and (d), the FB-SRC synthesizes\nan ac voltage vp on the tank circuit input, with negative\nand positive values ( −Vi , Vi ), while the HB-SRC generates a\nrectangular waveform voltage vp with zero and positive values\n(0, Vi ). As a consequence, the output rectiﬁed voltage on the\nsecondary side of the HB-SRC is given by (15), which is half\nof the value, when compared to the FB-SRC output voltage\n(see eq. (13)) for the same parameters ( Vi and n). The main\nwaveforms for the HB-SRC are shown in Fig. 2 (d).\nVC p = Ii\n8 fsC +Vo (14)\nVo = nVi\n2 (15)\nFigure 5. Main waveforms of the FB-SRC when a fault happens: main\nvoltages and currents before and after the fault.\nIII. P RO P O S E D FAU LT TO L E R A N T CO N V E RT E R\nAs already mentioned, depending on the semiconductors\nfailure mechanisms, the device will assume two possible\nstates: open-circuit (OC) or short-circuit (SC) [22]. For voltage\nsource converter, which is the case of the SRC, the OC fault\nis not catastrophic, since the power transfer will be naturally\ninterrupted. Instead, the SC fault is the main issue, because\nit can cause destructive damage to the power converter. In\naddition, the SC failure type is mostly likely to happen\nin the real application than the OC failure. Therefore, the\nreconﬁguration scheme proposed in this work is focused on\nthe SC fault.\nA. Reconﬁguration Scheme: Operation and Control Level\nThe proposed reconﬁguration scheme for the SRC consists\nin conﬁguring the FB-SRC in a HB-SRC after the fault, i.e.\nSC of a semiconductor. The detailed analysis is carried out in\nthis section for the FB-SRC shown in Fig. 3. Initially , as an\nexample, it is assumed that the switch s4 is damaged in SC (see\nFig. 3) and hence the switch s3 must remain open, avoiding\nshort-circuit of the input voltage source. Since the switch s4 is\nshort-circuited, the point b (highlighted in Fig. 3) is directly\nconnected to the primary side ground and the damaged device\nis used as a circuit path, resulting in the same circuit of the\nFig. 2 (b). Meanwhile, the healthy leg (composed of s1 and\ns2 ) operates normally . Fig. 4 shows the operation states of the\nSRC after the fault, i.e. after the reconﬁguration, where it can\nbe seen that the damaged switch s4 being used as a circuit\npath. Fig. 5 shows the main waveforms of the FB-SRC when\na fault happens.\nAs the HB-SRC provides only half of the output voltage\ncompared to the FB-SRC, the output voltage of the converter\nafter the fault will be half of its original value, which is not\ndesired. Thereafter, to overcome this problem and keep the\noutput voltage constant after the fault, a modiﬁcation to the\ncircuit of the secondary side rectiﬁer is proposed and a novel\nre-conﬁgurable rectiﬁer is obtained.\nB. F ault-T olerant SRC: T opology and Hardware Level\nFig. 6 (a) shows the topology of the standard full-bridge\nrectiﬁer (FBR), which is the most used in the secondary side\nof the SRC [11], [3]- [10]. In this conﬁguration, the output\nis given by: vo = vspk . Fig. 6(b) shows the topology of the\nvoltage-doubler rectiﬁer (VDR), which is also popular in the\nliterature, however it has not so far been applied to the SRC. In\nthis conﬁguration, the rectiﬁed output voltage is given by: vo =\n2vspk . Thus, in order to use the voltage doubler characteristic of\nthe VDR in case of fault of the SRC, keeping its output voltage\nconstant, a re-conﬁgurable rectiﬁer circuit presented in Fig. 6\n(c) is proposed. The proposed rectiﬁer has two split capacitors\nand an additional switch ( S f ) that allows to connect one side\nof the high frequency transformer secondary winding directly\nto the middle point of the capacitors, becoming a VDR.\nThe operation in normal and faulty conditions is depicted in\nFig. 6 (d) and Fig. 6 (e), respectively . In normal operation, the\nswitch S f is open, and the rectiﬁer operates as a standard FBR.\nIn fault case, the switch S f is on, and then the leg composed\nof the diodes D3 and D4 is bypassed. The bottom side of the\nsecondary winding is connected to the middle point of the\ncapacitors C1 and C2 , as depicted in Fig. 2 (e). Therefore, the\ncircuit operates as a VDR, and the output voltage value is twice\nthe output voltage value in normal operation. Finally , Fig. 8\nshows the complete proposed fault-tolerant series-resonant dc-\ndc converter (FT -SRC).\nThe main waveforms for the proposed FT -SRC before and\nafter a failure are depicted in Fig. 7. As can be observed, before\nthe failure (normal operation) the voltages vp and vCr have an\naverage value equal to zero and the output voltage is given\nby Vo . After the failure in the switch s4 for example, there is\nthe reconﬁguration, in which the FB-SRC will operate as a\nHB-SRC and switch S f is activated, so that the output stage\ncan operate as the VDR. Consequently , the output voltage\nwill remain in the same value, as desired. The effect of the\nreconﬁguration is only observed on the voltage vCr , that has\nan expected offset of Vo , and on the current iLr , that must be\ntwice the previous value to process the same amount of power\nthan before. Both characteristics are inherent of the HB-SRC.\nT o detect the fault and identify the faulty semiconductor,\na fault detection and diagnosis method must be implemented.\nThe main goal of this work is to propose the reconﬁguration\nscheme for the SRC converter and to propose the FT -SRC,\nas already mentioned. Hence existing methods can be used\nto identify the failure in the proposed converter. It is well-\nknow that the IGBT devices can withstand abnormal current\nduring a short period of time and this period depends on\nthe selected devices. For high-speed low-current IGBT , this\ntime is very short, while for high current IGBT this time\ncan be around 10 µs [23], [25], which is considerably large.\nTherefore, fast detection and current limiting method that can\ninterrupt abruptly the current is desired in this application.\nAmong the various methods that can be applied to this\nconverter, de-saturation detection method [26], protection by\ngate voltage limiting , current mirror method [26] and gate\nFigure 6. Possibles rectiﬁer topologies and proposed topology: (a) full-\nbridge rectiﬁer (FBR), (b) voltage-doubler rectiﬁer (VDR) and (c) proposed\nreconﬁgurable rectiﬁer. Operation of the proposed rectiﬁer: (d) operation as\na FBR, (e) operation as a VDR.\nFigure 7. Main waveforms of the proposed FT -SRC when a fault happens:\nmain voltages and currents before and after the fault.\nvoltage sensing [23] are very promised. All this indicated\nmethods require the sensing of device collector voltage and/or\ncurrent and therefore they are considerably simple to be\nimplemented. Additionally , a most sophisticated and effective\nmethod based on the transformer voltage/current proposed in\n[23] can also be used, but it requires more sensing parameters.\nIn case of OC fault, the proposed solution is still valid.\nInstead of opening the healthy IGBT of the faulty leg, the\nlogic system must close this IGBT . As an example, in case of\nOC fault of the switch s4, the switch s3 must remain closed, in\norder to be used as a path of the circuit. Therefore, to extend\nthe proposed solution for OC fault actuation, only the logic\nsystem must be adjusted.\nIV . F AU LT-T O L E R A N T BI D I R E C T I O NA L SRC\nThe fault-tolerance capability of the SRC presented in the\nprevious section for the unidirectional topology can easily be\nFigure 8. Proposed fault-tolerant SRC topology .\nFigure 9. Proposed bidirectional fault-tolerant SRC topology .\nextended to the bidirectional topology . In the last topology , the\ndiodes on the secondary side are replaced by active switches,\nin order to obtain an active bridge. Therefore, the operation is\nvery similar to the unidirectional version, but active switches\nare used instead of diodes. Similarly to the unidirectional ver-\nsion, in faulty case, the secondary bridge must be reconﬁgured\nin a voltage-doubler bridge and therefore the reconﬁgurable\nbridge is obtained with additional switches as well. Fig. 9\n(a) shows the proposed fault-tolerant bidirectional Series-\nResonant dc-dc converter. Nonetheless, the fault-tolerance\ncapability is obtained only when the power ﬂows from the\nprimary to the secondary side (i.e. from vi to vo ), whereas\nonly the secondary bridge is able to reconﬁgure in a voltage\ndoubler bridge. T o obtain a fully fault tolerant converter, either\nthe primary and secondary bridge must be reconﬁgurable\nand therefore the completely fault-tolerant SRC topology is\npresented in Fig. 9 (b). Although more semiconductores are\nused, the efﬁciency is not deteriorated, since the additional\nswitches are only activated in faulty case. Besides that, with\nthe proposed topology , the availability of the topology is\nhighly increased.\nFigure 10.

E X P E R I M E N TA L RE S U LT S\nIn order to verify the performance of proposed FT -SRC\nconverter and to attest the theoretical analysis presented in\nthis paper, a 10 kW prototype was built and experimental\nresults were obtained. The converter speciﬁcations are shown\nin T able I, while the resonant tank circuit parameters are shown\nin T able II. The prototype design was performed using the\nprevious described equations. A 1.2 kV IGBT IHW40N120\nwas selected as the main switch and it was used on the primary\nside and secondary sides, in which the intrinsic diodes of the\nIGBT were used to rectiﬁer. The converter operates in open\nloop and the gating signals are generated by the DSP . T o\nevaluate dynamically the performance of the converter under\nfault case, a short-circuit on the switch s2 was emulated by\nsoftware in the DSP . No diagnosis method was used, since it\nis not the main focus of this paper.\nFigure 12.

The picture of the complete test set-up of the\nmodular prototype is depicted in Fig. 10, in which a modular\nprototype composed by two dc-dc SRC is observed. The\nresults were obtained for the converter operating in steady-\nstate (before and after the fault) and also dynamically during\nthe fault and they are discussed herein. For safety reasons, the\ndynamic results were obtained for reduced input and output\nvoltages.\nInitially , the converter was tested considering only the\nreconﬁguration scheme in the primary bridge, without the\nproposed re-conﬁgurable rectiﬁer, in order to verify the inher-\nent capability to withstand a fault of the SRC. The test was\nperformed with input and output voltage of 200 V and 300\nV , respectively , and the results for this condition are presented\nin Fig. 12. The dynamic response of the FB-SRC during the\nfault of the switch s2 is depicted in Fig. 12 (a), in which\nis observed the converter remains operational after the fault,\nproving its inherent ability to handle the fault, as described\nin Section III.a. As expected the output voltage drops to half\nof its value (from 300 V to 150 V) after the fault and the\ncapacitor voltage has an offset of Vo . The inductor current\nis also reduced, because the test was performed with constant\nresistance as load and therefore reduction on the output voltage\nimplies in reduction on power. The detailed waveforms before\nand after the fault can observed in the Figs. 12 (b) and (c),\nrespectively .\nAfterwards, the proposed unidirectional FT -SRC (including\nthe proposed rectiﬁer) was tested, for an input voltage of 350 V\nand output voltage of 500 V and the main results are presented\nfrom Fig. 12 (c) to (f). The dynamic behavior during the fault\non switch s2 of the proposed FT -SRC is shown in Fig. 12\n(c) and as can be seen in this ﬁgure, the converter remains\noperational after the fault and it provides a constant output\nvoltage (500 V) even after the fault, attesting the effectiveness\nof the proposed rectiﬁer and the converter. As the output\nvoltage remains constant, the amount of processed power is\nthe same before and after the fault and therefore the amount of\ncurrent on the resonant tank is twice after the fault, because\nof the HB conﬁguration on the primary side. The detailed\nwaveforms before and after the fault can observed in the Figs.\n12 (e) and (f), respectively . T o summarize, the results have\nshown that the proposed converter can handle a short-circuit\nfault in one device and still provide the required output voltage\nand power, keeping the continuity of operation.\nVI. C O N C L U S I O N\nThis paper has proposed a fault-tolerant series-resonant dc-\ndc converter. The basic operation of the SRC based on the\nfull-bridge and half-bridge topologies was described. Then, a\nsemiconductor short-circuit fault case is evaluated for the full-\nbridge series-resonant converter and a reconﬁguration scheme,\nin which the FB-SRC operates as a HB-SRC, is presented. As\na result of the reconﬁguration, the output voltage is reduced.\nT o overcome this problem a modiﬁed rectiﬁer that can be\nreconﬁgured in a voltage doubler rectiﬁer, keeping the output\nvoltage constant, is proposed.\nThe main advantages of the proposed converter are: post-\nfault operation, simple implementation, reduced number of ad-\nditional component and no efﬁciency deterioration. However,\nthe resonant capacitor must be designed for higher voltage\nand the current effort on the healthy devices in failure mode\noperation is twice the than in normal mode operation.\nExperimental results for a 10 kW prototype were obtained\nand the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed fault\ntolerant series resonant dc-dc converter has been demonstrated.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T\nThe research leading to these results has received funding\nfrom the European Research Council under the European\nUnions Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) /\nERC Grant Agreement n.
