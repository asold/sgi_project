Introduction\nAn acoustic emission phenomenon is wide spread\nand relatively well described in a contemporary sci-\nentiﬁc literature (Boczar et al., 2012; Bolin, 1979;\nPierzga et al., 2013; Pollock, Stephens, 1971).\nMany diﬀerent sources of AE are known and the most\ncommon of them are e.g. crystal structure defects mo-\ntions in solids, cracks and micro cracks forming and\nshifting (Wotzka, Lusa , 2015), local environment\nmotions combined with internal friction, chemical re-\nactions,somebiologicalprocessandpartialdischarges.\nNowadays the AE phenomenon is willingly applied\nin numerous science areas, especially in technical di-\nagnostics, for machines and devices condition testing\npurposes (Cichoń et al., 2011; 2012; Grossmann,\nFeser,2001; Menonet al.,2001; Naderiet al.,2007;\nSharkawy et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007), as well\nas for construction structures examinations. A partial\ndischarge diagnostics in a high voltage electrical ap-\nparatus is one of the fundamental applications of the\nEA method (Błachowicz et al., 2016; Faraget al.,\n1999; Garcia-Colon et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2005).\nA PD issue is known asone of the most important and\nconstantaspects of a high voltageelectricalequipment\ninsulation systems diagnostics ( Frącz et al., 2015;\nLopatkiewicz et al., 2012). Although a single PD\nsource AE is represented by a discrete signal, in insu-\nlation systems there usually multi PD sources appear.\nAs an result a summed sequence of single pulses is re-\nceived by a measuring system, which in fact is read as\na continuous emission signal. Not only an early detec-\ntion of PD defects is highly desired presently, but also\nits localization and intensity estimation, especially ac-\ncording to a reliable and continuous electrical energy\nsupply, as well as a saveexploitation of a such primary\nelectrical power apparatus as power transformers.\nMany diﬀerent PD detection and analysis methods\nbased on a diﬀerent physical phenomena accompany-\ning a PD are presently known (Szmechtaet al., 2011;\nWitos, Gacek, 2008; Wotzka et al., 2010; 2011;\nZmarzły, Nagi,2014).ApartfromAE method, there\nmay be pointed such main methods as a spectropho-\ntometry method based on light emission (Deng et al.,\n266 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 41, Number 2, 2016\n2001; Frącz et al., 2012; 2013; Frącz, 2013; Wang\netal.,2006),thermovisionmethod,basedonheatemis-\nsion, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) method, based on\nchemical reactions results, electrical method, based on\nelectrical capacitance changes, transient earth volt-\nage (TEV), based on electromagnetic radiation in\nhigh frequency range, and ultra-high frequency (UHF)\nmethod, based on radio frequency radiation. From\namong all those techniques only an electrical method\nis a PD direct measurement method, which means it\ndelivers exact information about testing phenomena,\ni.e. an apparent charge value. All other mentioned\nmethodsareindirectmeasurementtechniques,somea-\nsured quantities are proportional for measuring phe-\nnomena properties. There under those methods ap-\nplication supports PD intensity and apparent charge\nvalue survey estimation only. Nevertheless, according\nto a PD diagnostics an ability of on-line application,\nduringapparatusnormalserviceishighlyessential.An\nAE method may be characterized by its completely\nnon-invasiveness,and easeof applicationaswellasrel-\natively high sensitivity level, quite good background\nnoise resistance level and simple measuring method-\nology. Furthermore, a PD source localization may be\napplied using an AE method, e.g. a triangulationtech-\nnique. An AE measurementprocedurerequiresthe ad-\nequate amount of sensors to be placed properly on the\nouter wall of the tested apparatus, and allows an AE\nsignalsregistrationforafurtheranalysis.Inmostcases\nthe testing apparatus does not need to be taken out of\nservice and a high voltage access is also not needed,\nas a result the highest safety level for apparatus and\ntesting team is provided by the method.\nA lot of model PD single and multi source identiﬁ-\ncation ability under laboratory conditions have been\nproven by various diﬀerent research that have been\nproceeded so far. Numerous partial discharge AE sig-\nnal descriptors have been also aimed. The main pur-\npose of the presented research is an on-site power\ntransformers PD identiﬁcation ability endeavor dur-\ning its normal service, using AE method. Some on-site\nuseful AE signal descriptors as well as a clear measur-\ning methodology and results interpretation are to be\nproposed in the paper.\n2. Research methodology\n2.1. Laboratory measurements\nThe presented research has been proceeded in the\nhigh voltage techniques laboratory of Electrical Power\nand Renewable Energy institute at the Opole Univer-\nsity of Technology. AE signals emitted by a PD source\nimmersed in used mineral transformer insulation oil\nhave been the research subject. Following spark gap\nconﬁgurations for PD source modeling have been se-\nlected for the measurements: point to point, multi-\npointtoplateandsurfacetype.SuchaPDsourcemod-\nels choice has allowed to simulate the most common\ninsulation faults of electrical power transformers, e.g.\npoint to point – a PD generated by a single insulation\nfault of two neighboring turns of windings, multi-point\nto plate – a PD generated between multi-point wind-\ning insulation faults and a groundedﬂat surface (tank,\nshielding), surface type – a PD generated on a bound-\nary of a solid and liquid dielectrics (paper – oil). For\nevery selected spark gap conﬁguration an ignition Ui\nandbreakdown Ub voltagelevelshavebeenexperimen-\ntally deﬁned. An electrical method with its apparent\ncharge and voltage level dependency curves has been\nused for the ignition voltage appointments, whereas\nbreakdown voltage levels have been deﬁned after se-\nquence of every spark gap breakdown tests, according\nto IEC60156. AE signals registrations have been pro-\nceeded for the selected voltage levels in the rangefrom\nUi to Ub: 120 sample signals for every selected volt-\nage level and for every spark gap conﬁguration, which\nhas given over 1800 registered signals total.

The measuring set up has been comple-\nmented by the PAC preampliﬁer 2/4/6 and ampliﬁer\nAE2 and Acquitek interface CH3160 installed on a PC\n(Fig. 1). A sampling rate of the measuring interface\nhas been set to 1 MHz, which has allowed to register\nsignals in the range from 20 kHz to 500kHz.\nFig. 1.

A PD source as well as the sensor positions\nhave been not modiﬁed during research. Absolute dis-\ntance between sensor and PD source has amounted\nM. Kunicki, A. Cichoń, S.

On-site measurements\nAn electrical power transformer during normal ser-\nvice has been selected as a real life research object.\nA nominal voltage levels of the transformer have been\n115/16.5kV. On-site measurements have been pro-\nceeded with the same instruments as had been used\nin laboratory: piezoelectric joint sensor, preampliﬁer\n2/4/6,ampliﬁerAE2andPCequippedwithmeasuring\ninterface as an acquisition unit. According to the fact\nthat three phase transformer has been tested, three\nmeasuring tracks have had to be applied simultane-\nously, for supporting every single phase independent\nmeasurements (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3.

Likewise the laboratory measurements, AE\nsensors have been attached to the transformer outer\nwall with dedicated magnetic grips for the best sensor\nand tank coupling (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4. AE sensor attached to the transformer\n– general view.\nAE signals have been registered in the range from\n20 kHz to 500 kHz, and the sampling rate has been set\nto 1 MHz. Measuring window has been set to 20 ms,\n268 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 41, Number 2, 2016\nlike in laboratory research case, and additionally to\n200ms, which corresponds with 1 and 10 periods of\n50 Hz voltage supply respectively.\nUnlike the laboratory research, a supply voltage\nlevel adjustment has not been possible during normal\nservice of the testing apparatus, and all on-site mea-\nsurements have been proceeded with nominal opera-\ntionvoltagelevelofthetransformer.Accordingtothat\nfact voltage level inﬂuence on PD AE signals has not\nbeen examined.

Results and discussion\n3.1. Laboratory measurements\nThe selected spark gaps have been conﬁgured for\nresearch tasks with particular consideration of their\nbreakdown voltage levels. It has been desired all Ub\nlevel should be as equal as possible. Experimentally\ndetermined Ub levels for point to point, multi-point\nto plate and surface type spark gap conﬁgurations\nassumed 45 kV, 43 kV and 42 kV respectively. There\na)\nb)\nc)\nFig. 5.

Measure-\nment results have been related with increasing supply\nvoltage levels. Example time runs and spectrograms\nof captured AE signals generated by every selected\nmodel PD source for similar relative supply voltage\nlevels have been presented in Fig. 5.\nPD activity in both halves of a supply voltage pe-\nriod has been noticed for point to point and multi-\npoint to plate conﬁgurations, furthermore it has been\nobserved that amplitudes of AE signals related with\nthe ﬁrsthalf of period havebeen relativelyhigher than\nthose related with the second one (Fig. 6). In case of\nsurface type conﬁguration over 88% of all of the reg-\nistered PD signals for all supply voltage levels have\nshowed AE related only with the ﬁrst half of a voltage\nperiod, which leads to the conclusion that the applied\nspark gap conﬁguration generates AE only in a ﬁrst\npositive half of the supply voltage period.\nAccording to frequency components and energy\nshare of individual AE signals (Fig. 7) it is easy to\nbe noticed that the largest part of the whole energy\nM.

Additionally, surface\ntypePDsourcehasgeneratedsigniﬁcantpartofenergy\nfor frequency components about 250 kHz. In case of\nother PD source conﬁgurations higher frequency com-\nponents generally have not been above a background\nnoise.\nThe next step of the research has been an evalu-\nation of indicated descriptors for both amplitude and\npower density spectrum of analyzed AE signals. De-\nscriptors have been deﬁned for every registered signal\nfor every spark gap conﬁguration and selected supply\nvoltage level. Mean values of every descriptor have\nbeen deﬁned for voltage levels. A high level of co-\nherence and reproducibility have been noticed for all\nachieved results, none of any descriptor relative devia-\ntion has exceeded 6%.

On-site measurements\nA slightly diﬀerent attitude is needed while a\nreal life normal service apparatus measurements are\nproceeded, especially with reference to the research\nmethodology. The main diﬀerence between laboratory\nmeasurementsandon-siteoneshasbeen a supplyvolt-\nage level adjustment. All of the on-site measurements\nhave been proceeded under constant nominal working\nvoltage level, there has been no possibility to make\nany adjustments. A line-to-line voltage during all tests\non the transformer has been set to 118 kV. It has been\nalsonecessarytotakeaccountofmuchhighernoiseand\ninterferences level than in laboratory environment. As\nmentionedabove,experimentalAEsensorspositioning\nhas had to be applied for electrical power transformer\nmeasurement results could be as explicit as possible.\nPotentially there have been three independent high\nvoltage sources to be tested, related with the trans-\nformer three phase windings encapsulated in a com-\nmon tank (Fig. 10).\nFig. 10. Electrical power transformer 115/16.5 kV\nused for research – general view.\nThe AE sensors have been ﬁnally installed under\nhigh voltage transformer bushings, on the 110kV side\nof the tank.

Three tracks measure-\nments have been proceeded simultaneously during all\ntests. Some exemplary time runs and spectrograms of\nregistered AE signals for every phase captured within\n200ms (10 periods of 50 Hz voltage) have been pre-\nsented in Fig. 11. All tracks have been synchronized\nand measurements have been triggered by ﬁrst track\npulse related with phase L1.\nPeriodicstructureshavebeen obviouslyseenat the\ntraces, 10 ms intervals between serial pulses have been\na)\nb)\nc)\nFig. 11.

The\nL3 aimed sensor has not captured any activity that\ncould be read as a PD signal.\nAnalysis of AE signals registered by sensors L1\nand L2 within 20 ms (Fig. 12) has discovered one very\nimportant dependency: signal form the L2 sensor has\nbeen delayed about 1 ms toward the L1 sensor (which\nis about 1.4 m for a sound wave in oil), which has also\nM.

Strong domination of\nfrequency components below 100kHz may be clearly\nnoticed.\nLikewisethelaboratorymeasurementanalysis,am-\nplitude and power density spectrum descriptors have\nbeen determined.

A high coher-\nence level of the descriptors has been discovered, what\nshows a similar energy share of the same frequency\ncomponents in both L1 and L2 signals. It is highly ex-\npected that both signals have been generated by sim-\nilar nature sources, and taking into account all pre-\nvious conclusions it has been probably the same one\nsource.\n274 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 41, Number 2, 2016\na)\n b)\nFig. 15.
