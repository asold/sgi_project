    "abstract": "In China, fruit tree diseases are a significant threat to the development of the fruit tree industry, and knowledge about fruit tree diseases is the most needed professional knowledge for fruit farmers and other practitioners in the fruit tree industry. Research papers are the primary sources of professional knowledge that represent the cutting-edge progress in fruit disease research. Traditional knowledge engineering methods for knowledge acquisition require extensive and cumbersome preparatory work, and they demand a high level of professional background and information technology skills from the handlers. This paper, from the perspective of fruit tree industry knowledge dissemination, aims at users such as fruit farmers, fruit tree experts, fruit tree knowledge communicators, and information gatherers. It proposes a fast, cost-effective, and low-technical-barrier method for extracting fruit tree disease knowledge from research paper abstracts—K-Extract, based on large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. Under zero-shot conditions, K-Extract utilizes conversational LLMs to automate the extraction of fruit tree disease knowledge. The K-Extract method has constructed a comprehensive classification system for fruit tree diseases and, through a series of optimized prompt questions, effectively overcomes the deficiencies of LLM models in providing factual accuracy. This paper tests multiple LLM models available in the Chinese market, and the results show that K-Extract can seamlessly integrate with any conversational LLM model, with the DeepSeek model and the Kimi model performing particularly well. The experimental results indicate that LLM models have a high accuracy rate in handling judgment tasks and simple knowledge Q&amp;A tasks. The K-Extract method is simple, efficient, and accurate, and can serve as a convenient tool for knowledge extraction in the agricultural field.",
