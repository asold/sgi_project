    "abstract": "Recently, the interest in grid-tied PV transformer-less inverters has increased rapidly, because of their higher efficiency and lower cost compared to traditional line transformer inverters. This paper presents a new modified transformer-less topology derived from H5 inverter, and provides a detailed comparison between the use of GaN and Si devices for the proposed topology. Detailed operation modes, inverter structure and switching strategy of the proposed topology are presented. Datasheet information, conduction losses, switching losses, and heat sink requirements are studied and analyzed to provide an accurate comparison between GaN and Si power devices for the proposed topology operating at unity power factor. The results show that, GaN power devices significantly reduce the power losses in the system, which consequently allow a significant increase in either inverter power rating or switching frequency. Thus, the use of GaN power devices for the proposed inverter can be more appealing and cost-effective approach.",
