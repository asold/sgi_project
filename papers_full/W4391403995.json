  "abstract": "Transformers, as the hub equipment of the power system, are highly valued by engineering and scientific researchers in production practice and scientific research. The goal of transformer research is to ensure the safe operation of transformers while considering their economic benefits, arrange transformer inspections reasonably to reduce inspection costs, and save labor and maintenance costs reasonably. This study first provides a brief analysis of the life cycle cost of transformers. The life cycle of transformers is divided into initial cost, operating cost, maintenance cost, fault cost, and scrap cost. Based on the distribution of transformer failure rate, the corresponding life cycle cost of transformers is calculated. Taking 110 kV transformers as an example, the differences in the impact of key factors on the full life cycle cost are analyzed to achieve high quality, high reliability, economically optimal equipment procurement.",
