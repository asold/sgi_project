INTRODUCTION\nPower transformer, especially large-capacity transformer\nplays an important role in power transmission, and its\noperating characteristics have an important impact on\nthe stable operation of the transformer itself and the\npower system. In order to reduce the size of large-\ncapacity transformers, three phases transformer with ﬁve\ncolumns core or single phase core is often used. In the\nconnection of transformer winding, Y 0/1 is the most\ncommon type.\nWhen unloaded the power transformer is energized, due to\nthe transient characteristics of the magnetic ﬂux and the non-\nlinear characteristics of the core material, inrush current with\na considerable amplitude will be generated. The maximum\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Xue Zhou\n.\npeak value of the inrush current may reach about 10 times\nthe rated current of the transformer, and the duration time\nmay be as long as several seconds [1]–[3], which may cause\ndamage to the transformer. At the same time, the large inrush\ncurrent and the sympathetic inrush generated by interaction\nbetween transformer and its adjacent operating transformer\nmay cause the main protection of the transformer, generator\nand the adjacent line to malfunction [4]. Especially in recent\nyears, serious accidents such as misoperation of the busbar\nconnection protection and even the zero-sequence backup\nprotection of the upper-level line during the power trans-\nformer energization. It shows that the large zero-mode inrush\ncurrent generated by the transformer preﬂuxing inrush cur-\nrent is the direct cause of the misoperation [5], [6]. Therefore,\nthe way of reducing the inrush current to ensure the safety of\nthe transformer itself and improve the protection performance\nhas been highly valued by scholars.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nInrush current is the current caused by magnetic ﬂux sat-\nuration and core saturation characteristics. Its characteris-\ntics are related to factors such as the initial phase angle of\nthe voltage, the residual ﬂux, and the hysteresis character-\nistic [7]–[9]. For a three-phase transformer, the connection\nof the winding and the core structure must be considered\ntoo. Researches have put forward methods to reduce inrush\ncurrent, which can be mainly divided into two types: con-\ntrolled switching and switching inrush current suppressor.\nThe principle of controlled switching is that the appropriate\nclosing angle is selected to weaken the transient magnetic\nﬂux so that it does not exceed the saturation valve. This tech-\nnology is currently widely used. The traditional controlled\nswitching strategies mainly includes rapid closing strategy,\ndelayed closing strategy and simultaneous closing strate-\ngym [1], [10], [11]. Among them, the rapid closing strategy is\nthat one phase is closed at ﬁrst, and the other two phases are\nclosed 1/4 cycle later. However, the premise of the strategy is\nthat the three-phase residual ﬂux is known. The simultaneous\nclosing strategy is only applicable to speciﬁc three-phase\nresidual ﬂux modes of transformers. For the delayed closing\nstrategy, the residual ﬂux of one phase is needs to know at\nleast. After the phase with known residual ﬂux is closed,\nthe other phases are closed after a few cycles later according\nto the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect.\nA method to obtain the residual ﬂux of the core proposed\nusing LabVIEW [12]. Regarding the measurement of resid-\nual ﬂux. This method requires that the measuring device is\nalways running on the network. Generally, the residual ﬂux\nof the iron core after the circuit breaker is opened can be\nmeasured. However, for the ﬁrst time the transformer is put\ninto operation, or the transformer is overhauled, or the DC\nresistance test is performed, and due to the special changing\nlaw of the residual ﬂux, the accurate measurement of the\nresidual ﬂux under various working conditions has always\nbeen a technical problem [3], [13]–[16].\nThese three closing control strategies all need to obtain at\nleast one phase residual ﬂux in advance. However, due to\nthe special law of residual ﬂux, the measurement of residual\nﬂux has always been a technical problem For this problem,\nit is proposed a simple controlled switching strategy [17]\nassuming that the residual ﬂux is in the worst case to design\nthe closing angle, so the residual ﬂux may not be needed.\nThe actual effect is that the inrush current can be reduced to\nbelow 46.7% of the maximum inrush current, so the reduction\neffect is not signiﬁcant. It is proposed to determine the closing\nsequence and time by controlling the opening sequence and\ntime of the three-phase circuit breaker. This method requires\nthat the opening of the circuit breaker is controllable. How-\never, the wrong opening of the circuit breaker may bring\nserious consequences, so this method is difﬁcult to be realized\nin engineering.\nIn addition to the residual ﬂux, the optimal closing time\nin controlled switching is often related to the core struc-\nture type and winding connection form. It is analyzed the\nmagnetic ﬂux of the three-phase three-legged stacked-core\npower transformers with Y/Y-connected winding during the\nclosing process, so as to obtain the optimal closing angle\n[18]. However, the ﬂux coupling between three phases is not\nconsidered in ﬂux calculation, and the method also depends\non the accurate measurement of residual ﬂux. Based on the\nduality transformation between electric and magnetic circuits\n[19], a circuit model of three phases transformer with single\nphase cores and Y 0/1-connected transformer that is consid-\nered coupling among phases is established. This modeling\nmethod for obtaining magnetic ﬂux can be extended to solve\nthe magnetic ﬂux of transformers with other structures and\nit has universal applicability. However, in the modeling, this\narticle only considered the saturation characteristics of the\niron core. And corresponding strategy is proposed assuming\nthat the three-phase magnetic ﬂux has ‘‘core ﬂux equaliza-\ntion’’ effect. It is fail to consider that the possibility that\nmagnetic ﬂux ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ may be insigniﬁcant,\nwhich may result in a failure of the strategy. It is considered\nthat there is ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect in 1-connected\ntransformer, that is, after a certain phase is closed, the tran-\nsient magnetic ﬂux of the other two phases will rapidly\ndecay to equilibrium, so the delayed closing strategy can be\nadopted. However, the strategy fails to consider the possibility\nthat the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect may not be obvious.\nAt present, there is no research report on the application\nof controlled switching in inrush current reduction of three\nphases transformer with ﬁve columns core or single phase\ncore. Therefore, in the research of controlled switching strat-\negy, how to avoid the problem of accurate measurement of\nresidual ﬂux, consider the core structure and characteristics\nof three phases large capacity transformer with ﬁve columns\ncore or single phase core, model and analyze the magnetic\nﬂux in the process of closing, and put forward the optimal\nclosing strategy are needed to be in-depth research.\nThe principle of reduction of inrush current by switching\ninrush current suppressor is that the transient magnetic ﬂux\nof transformer is reduced as much as possible by switch-\ning voltage control equipment or preﬂuxing equipment. The\nmethod of switching preﬂuxing transformer is that the pre-\nﬂuxing transformer is put into operation ﬁrst, and then the\ntransformer is energized after the magnetic ﬂux is stable.\nFinally, the preﬂuxing transformer is bypassed. This method\nis mainly used in ship power system. However, the inrush\nreduction effect of this method will be affected by residual\nﬂux. In reference [6], switching power electronic equipment\ncan realize the voltage rising slowly by controlling the trigger\nangle of thyristor. It can be applied to the inrush current reduc-\ntion of large-capacity transformer. The reduction effect will\nnot be affected by residual ﬂux. However, it is complicated\nthat the strategic design involves power electronic equipment\ncontrol.\nThe main inrush current reduction principle of switching\nthe preﬂuxing equipment is that the initial magnetic ﬂux\nof the transformer is set as a certain expected value by\npreﬂuxing before the transformer is energized, and then the\nmagnetic ﬂux control can be realized by using the controlled\n38962 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nswitching. DC current is mainly used to preﬂux at present\nresearch. In other words, the magnetic ﬂux of the transformer\nis set as saturation value by charging DC current in the\nprimary side of the transformer, and then the optimal closing\ncontrol angle can be obtained. This method is used in a single-\nphase transformer, and the preﬂuxing current is generated by\nthe designing capacitor. The inrush current reduction effect\nof the strategy is signiﬁcant [14]. The strategy avoids the\nproblem of residual ﬂux measurement at the same time. The\nmethod provides possibilities for the inrush current reduction\nof more widely used three-phase transformers.\nHowever, this document estimates the preﬂuxing current as\nthe no-load current level of transformer, and the effectiveness\nof the preﬂuxing current is demonstrated through simulation\nand experiments. But design of the preﬂuxing current is\nlacked the necessary theoretical analysis for parameter. For\nlarge three-phase transformers, especially three phases and\nﬁve columns transformer and a Y 0/1-connected winding,\nthe three-phase magnetic ﬂuxes are mutually coupled. More-\nover, when the three-phase magnetic ﬂux generated by the\nprimary current of the transformer is unbalanced, current\nwill be generated in the closed triangular connected wind-\ning, which affect the primary current in turn. Therefore, the\nthree-phase magnetic ﬂuxes will affect each other during\nthe preﬂuxing process for this kind of transformer, and the\nrequired preﬂuxing parameters cannot be deduced by simple\nequivalent of the previously studied single-phase transformer.\nTherefore, in order to accurately design the parameters such\nas the preﬂuxing current that meet the requirements, it is\nnecessary to remodel the Y 0/1-connected transformer that\ncan consider the core structure and analyze the magnetic ﬂux\ncharacteristics in the preﬂuxing process. In fact, the magnetic\nﬂux characteristics are also closely related to the hysteresis\nand saturation characteristics of the iron core. Its analysis\nrequires solving nonlinear equations, which is also a difﬁcult\npoint in research.\nIn summary, for large-capacity transformers, it is a valu-\nable work to propose an inrush reduce strategy that can avoid\nresidual ﬂux measurement and consider the structure and\ncharacteristics of the core. There are few related studies at\npresent.\nThis paper constructs a large-capacity transformer mag-\nnetic circuit model. When solving the analytical expression\nof the ﬂux linkage in the process of applying the strategy,\nthe Y 0/1-connected winding mode and the hysteresis and\nsaturation characteristics of the core are considered. And\nthen, in order to meet the requirements of inrush current\nreduction, the parameters of the control strategy are designed\nthrough magnetic ﬂux analysis. After that, simulation is used\nto verify the analysis, and the effects of different inrush\ncurrent reduction strategies under various working conditions\nare compared, which shows that the strategy of this article has\nbetter ability to reduce inrush current. Finally, the differential\nprotection is taken as an example to analyze. The result shows\nthat this strategy can improve a variety of types of protection\nperformance effectively.\nFIGURE 1. Schematic diagram of core excitation characteristics and\ninrush current generation principle.\nII. INRUSH CURRENT REDUCTION STRATEGY BASED ON\nPREFLUXING AND CONTROLLED SWITCHING\nThe magnetic ﬂux solution of large-capacity transformer\nduring preﬂuxing and controlled switching process is the\ntheoretical basis of inrush current reduction strategy design.\nTherefore, it is necessary to establish a transformer ﬂux\nsolution model ﬁrst. The model should be able to consider\nthe different core structures of large-capacity transformers,\nwinding connection modes, core nonlinear characteristics,\ncore residual ﬂux, and the control parameters of the strategy\nsuch as preﬂuxing current and closing angle too. Therefore,\nin this section, the basic principle of inrush current reduction\nis brieﬂy introduced ﬁrst, and then a magnetic circuit model\nis established that can reﬂect the characteristics of the trans-\nformer above from the perspective of the magnetic circuit.\nOn this basis, with the goal of designing an ideal three-phase\nmagnetic ﬂux, the inﬂuence of the control parameters on the\nmagnetic ﬂux characteristics is studied so as to propose a\nparameter design method to achieve the purpose of inrush\ncurrent reduction. Finally, the inrush current reduction strat-\negy is proposed.\nA. PRINCIPLE AND STRATEGY OF INRUSH CURRENT\nREDUCTION\nThe root cause of the inrush current generated by the trans-\nformer lies in the non-linear excitation characteristics of the\niron core, as shown in FIGURE 1. That is, when the trans-\nformer core is not saturated, the excitation inductance will be\nvery large, and the required excitation current can be almost\nneglected at this time. When the magnetic ﬂux in the iron\ncore exceeds the saturation value, the magnetizing inductance\nwill drop to the leakage inductance level, resulting in a larger\ninrush current.\nThe electromagnetic equation in the process of the single-\nphase transformer energized is following.\nN dφ\ndt +iR =Um sin(ωt +α) (1)\nIn the equation, φis the magnetic ﬂux in the transformer\ncore, i winding current, R is the sum of the system resistance\nand the transformer closing winding resistance, Um is the\nsystem power supply amplitude, and α is the power initial\nphase angle at the time of closing.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 38963\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nBy solving equation(1), the expression of magnetic ﬂux φ\ncan be solved as follows.\nφ=−LUm cos(ωt +α)√\nR2 +(ωL)2\n+\n(\nφin + LUm cos α√\nR2 +(ωL)2\n)\ne−R\nL t\n(2)\nIn the formula, L is the average inductance of the closing\nwinding, and φin is the magnetic ﬂux of the iron core before\nthe transformer is closed, which is called the initial magnetic\nﬂux. The core magnetic ﬂux consists of two parts: one part\nis a periodic component, and the other part is an attenuated\naperiodic component. It can be seen that in addition to the\nparameter L determined by the transformer’s own charac-\nteristics, and φ is mainly affected by R, α and the initial\nmagnetic ﬂux φin. Increasing the value of R can reduce the\nmagnetic ﬂux amplitude, which is mainly achieved through\nseries resistance. However, the series resistance method alone\nis always not effective and needed to be coordinated with\nother means [20], [21]. So, the inﬂuence of φin and α on\ninrush current are mainly explored in this article.\nLet φm = LUm\n√\nR2+(ωL)2 , then φm is a certain value. When\nthe initial phase angle αof the power supply takes different\nvalues, the maximum core magnetic ﬂux will be different. Let\nφp =φm cos α. φp is called the prospective magnetic ﬂux.\nWhen φin =−φp, the maximum magnetic ﬂux amplitude\nis the smallest, which is equal to φm, and the transformer\ngoes into steady state directly after closing. At this time,\nthe initial phase angle α of the power supply satisﬁes α =\nπ-arc cos\n(\nφin\nφm\n)\n. Since the saturation ﬂux of the iron core is\nabout op (1.15 −1.25)φmt, there will be no inrush current\nunder this condition.\nWhen φin ̸= −φp, and the φin is positive polarity, for\nexample, the initial magnetic ﬂux is equal to φs, the maximum\nvalue of the magnetic ﬂux is φs if α =180◦. The saturation\nvalue is not exceeded at this time, so there is almost no inrush\ncurrent.\nHowever, when φin ̸=−φ p, and the initial phase angle of\nthe power supply is 0 ◦, the maximum amplitude of the mag-\nnetic ﬂux is φin +2φm. Under normal circumstances, the core\nresidual ﬂux φr will not exceed 0.85φ m [1]. If the initial\nmagnetic ﬂux is residual ﬂux, the maximum magnetic ﬂux\namplitude will be the maximum 2.85φ m when φin =0.85φm.\nWhen φr is negative, the maximum magnetic ﬂux amplitude\nis −2.85φm. In both conditions, maximum magnetic ﬂux is\nfar greater than the saturation magnetic ﬂux, and will cause\nvery large inrush current. Therefore, the size of the initial\nmagnetic ﬂux φin and the initial phase angle αof the power\nsupply at the time of closing have a great inﬂuence on the\nmagnitude of the inrush current. If the proper initial magnetic\nﬂux and power initial phase angle can be selected, the inrush\ncurrent can be effectively reduced.\nThe initial magnetic ﬂux is not easy to obtain. First,\nbecause of the closed-loop core structure of the transformer\ncore. Measurement equipment such as a ﬂux meter cannot be\nused. Second, due to the special changing law of the residual\nFIGURE 2. Change curve of residual flux.\nﬂux of the transformer core. In the view of classical ferro-\nmagnetism, when the transformer winding is supplied with\nexcitation current, the iron core will be subjected to the action\nof an external magnetic ﬁeld, and the magnetic domains\ninside will be arranged in accordance with the direction of\nthe magnetic ﬁeld. Finally, a magnetic ﬁeld Bm inside the\niron core is formed, as shown in FIGURE 2. If the excitation\ncurrent of the winding suddenly changes to zero at the time\nof to, for the magnetic domain losing the external constraint,\nsome domains interact with the surrounding domains and\ntend to be disordered, and the domains concentrated in the\nsame direction decrease. The macroscopic manifestation is\nthat the magnetic induction intensity decreases rapidly to a\ncertain state value. The residual ﬂux of this state is deﬁned as\nthe initial residual ﬂux Bro (the intersection of B-H hysteresis\nloop and longitudinal axis). However, at this time, the energy\nof the core domain has not been reduced to the minimum. The\ndirection of the magnetic domain will continually slowly con-\nfuse with the passage of time, leading to the further decrease\nof the magnetic ﬂux, and the domain motion reaches a stable\nstate after tw. The residual ﬂux state in the core is deﬁned as\nthe steady-state residual ﬂux Brw [14].\nIn the process that ﬂux changes from initial residual ﬂux to\nsteady-state residual ﬂux state, the magnetic domain moves\nslowly, and the voltage of core winding is almost zero. When\nthe core residual ﬂux reaches a stable state, the magnetic\nﬁeld state will not change, unless a new excitation current\nis applied to the winding.\nThe existing research methods of residual ﬂux measure-\nment are based on the on-line integration of voltage. In the\nactual situation, the voltage corresponding to the to −tw stage\nis almost 0, so it is difﬁcult to measure the magnetic ﬂux\nchange. At present, the direct measurement of residual ﬂux\nof transformer core is still a difﬁcult problem in engineering.\nTherefore, this paper proposes the method that the core ﬂux\nis preﬂuxed to the positive saturation value φs by DC current,\nso as to provide a certain initial ﬂux, and then optimal closing\nangle can be selected to close. According to the basic princi-\nple of inrush current reduction, the optimal closing angle is\n180 degrees.\nThe speciﬁc process of inrush current reduction strategy is\nas follows, which is mainly divided into two parts. First, A-\n38964 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 3. The inrush current reduction strategy based on prefluxing and\ncontrolled switching.\nphase of the transformer is preﬂuxed to the positive saturation\nvalue. Secondly, the circuit breaker of this phase is closed at\nthe initial phase angle of the power source at 180 ◦. The same\npreﬂuxing and controlled switching strategy as A-phase is\nadopted to B-Phase. According to the balance of the three-\nphase magnetic ﬂux, C-Phase magnetic ﬂux will directly\nenter the steady-state without preﬂuxing. There is almost no\ninrush current when closing at any closing angle, which will\nbe further analyzed later. Overall, almost no inrush current\nis generated during the entire closing process. Therefore,\nthis strategy can be simply described to a ‘‘phase-to-phase\npreﬂuxing and phase-to-phase controlled switching closing’’\nmethod. The reason that ‘‘separate-phase preﬂuxing, three-\nphase closing at the same time’’ method is not selected for the\npower phase angles of three phases meeting the symmetrical\nrelationship of 120 ◦. To completely eliminate inrush current,\nsymmetrical relationship of 120 ◦of the initial magnetic ﬂux\nof three phases must also be satisﬁed.\nHowever, for a three-phase transformer, the magnetic ﬂux\nof each phase is mutually coupled. So, when the residual ﬂux\nis unknown, it is difﬁcult to design the size of preﬂuxing\ncurrent of each phase that can make the initial magnetic\nﬂux meet the symmetrical relationship requirement analyzed\nabove. It will be further analyzed later. Therefore, this paper\nproposes the inrush current reduction strategy of ‘‘phase-\nto-phase preﬂuxing and phase-to-phase controlled switching\nclosing’’, which avoids the problem of unknown residual ﬂux\nthrough decoupling. The preﬂuxing speed mainly depends on\nthe time constant of the preﬂuxing current. If the DC cur-\nrent source with a small time constant is selected, the entire\nclosing process time will be short. The energization progress\nof transformer does not require high time requirement in\nfact. The basic process of the reduction strategy is shown\nin FIGURE 3. As for design of the key parameters such\nas preﬂuxing current, the preﬂuxing time, the closing time\nof each phase, etc. involved in the strategy will be further\nanalysis.\nFIGURE 4. Three phases and five columns Y0/1 connection transformer\nstructure diagram.\nB. MAGNETIC CIRCUIT MODEL CONSTRUCTION AND\nMAGNETIC FLUX ANALYSIS\n1) MAGNETIC CIRCUIT MODEL CONSTRUCTION\nTransformer modeling mainly includes two methods: mag-\nnetic circuit and circuit [22]–[27]. In large-capacity trans-\nformers, there are mainly two types of cores: three phases and\nﬁve columns type and three phases transformer with single\nphase core. Between them, the three phases and ﬁve columns\ncore structure is more representative because it can reﬂect the\nmutual coupling of the three-phase magnetic ﬂux.\nThe three phases and ﬁve columns transformer model is\nmodeled from the perspective of the magnetic circuit is clear\nand intuitive, and the physical meaning of the parameter is\nclear. Furthermore, by setting the reluctance parameters in the\nmagnetic circuit, the structure of the three phases transformer\nwith single phase core can be reﬂected.\nTherefore, the magnetic circuit of the three phases and ﬁve\ncolumns transformer is constructed to lay the foundation for\nthe magnetic ﬂux analysis.\nThe core structure of the three phases and ﬁve columns\ntransformer and the winding connection mode of Y 0/1con-\nnection mode is shown in FIGURE 4. According to the elec-\ntromagnetic ﬁeld theory, the magnetic ﬂux in the transformer\ncore comes from the magnetomotive force generated by the\nwinding currents of each phase. Assuming that the magneto-\nmotive force in the three-phase primary winding is FAFBFC,\nthe magnetic ﬂux in the three-phase core column, main yoke,\nand side yoke are as shown in the following ﬁgure.\nBecause of the secondary winding of the transformer is\ndelta type, the winding will generate current due to electro-\nmagnetic induction when the three-phase magnetic ﬂux is\nunbalanced. And each phase winding on the delta winding\nside ﬂows the same magnitude zero-mode characteristic cur-\nrent, corresponding to the magnetomotive force F0. Accord-\ning to Lenz’s law, the magnetic ﬂux generated by the induced\ncurrent is opposite to the original zero-sequence magnetic\nﬂux, which plays a demagnetization effect.\nBecause the leakage inductance of the secondary side is\nsmall and the secondary winding is almost in a supercon-\nducting state, the induced current generated will almost com-\npletely cancel out the original zero-sequence magnetic ﬂux,\ni.e., φA +φB +φC =0.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 38965\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 5. Three phases and five columns Y0/1-connected winding\ntransformer equivalent magnetic circuit.\nWhen the iron core is not in a deep saturation state,\nthe reluctance of the iron core will be much smaller than\nthat of the air, so the magnetic ﬂux is mainly concentrated\nin the iron core, and the leakage ﬂux will be much less than\nthat of the iron core. Therefore, the inﬂuence of leakage ﬂux\nis ignored in the magnetic circuit modeling. The equivalent\nmagnetic circuit diagram is constructed as shown in FIGURE\n5 through the above analysis.\nIn the ﬁgure, R3 R4 R5 are the reluctance of the ABC three\nphase cores, R1 is the side yoke reluctance, and R2 is the\nmain yoke reluctance. When the core is not saturated, there\nis R5 =R4 =R3. Each section of the core is made of the\nsame material, so its reluctance is the ratio of the length of\nthe magnetic circuit to the cross section, and is also related to\nthe excitation characteristics of the core.\nThe magnetic ﬂux generated by the magnetomotive force\nof each phase will be coupled to each other due to the con-\nnection of the iron core, so that R1 and R2 are not equal to\n0 in the magnetic circuit correspondingly. If R1 =R2 =0,\nand R3 R4 R5 are the reluctance of each phase core of a three\nphases transformer with single phase core. The magnetic\nﬂux between phases can be seen as not coupled, and the\nmagnetic circuit is equivalent to the magnetic circuit of a three\nphases transformer with single phase core. Therefore, the ﬂux\nanalytical expression of three phases and ﬁve columns trans-\nformer can be used to analyze three phases transformer with\nsingle phase core by setting R1 =R2 =0.\nAccording to Kirchhoff’s current law, an equation that\nmagnetic ﬂux is the solution variable can be established by\nadopting the branch circuit analysis method.\nGF =8 (3)\nAmong them, in the magnetic circuit, G is the nodal\nadmittance matrix of reluctance. 8 is the magnetic ﬂux\ninjected into each node. F is the magnetomotive force of\neach node, which is the variable to be solved. Where 8 =[\nFB−F0\nR4\n,FC−F0\nR5\n,−FC−F0\nR5\n,−FB−F0\nR4\n,−FA−F0\nR3\n]′\n, and then the\nFIGURE 6. Iron core excitation characteristic curve.\nthree-phase core ﬂux can be expressed as follows.\n\n\n\nφA =F5+FA−F0\nR3\nφB =F4+FB−F1−F0\nR4\nφC =F3+FC −F2−F0\nR5\n(4)\nAccording to the above analysis, there is equation below.\nφA +φB +φC =0 (5)\nCore excitation characteristics is needed to be considered\nwhen solving the above equations. The core excitation char-\nacteristic (φ−i) has saturation and hysteresis characteristics,\nwhich can be described by a hysteresis loop model with more\nparameters. The corresponding reluctance R of each segment\nsatisﬁes R = Ni/φ. So it will also have saturation and\nhysteresis characteristics. The equivalent magnetic circuit\nactually contains multiple nonlinear elements, thus equation\n(3) is a nonlinear equation group. It is very difﬁcult to obtain\nan analytical expression of the magnetic ﬂux when the precise\nnonlinear characteristics of the iron core is considered. If only\nthe numerical solution of the magnetic ﬂux can be obtained, it\nis not conducive to grasping the changing law of the magnetic\nﬂux during the preﬂuxing and controlled switching process,\nand it is not conducive to the design of control parameters\nof the strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain a simple\nand effective magnetic ﬂux analytical expression as much as\npossible. In order to simplify the solution of magnetic ﬂux,\nthe actual hysteresis loop model can be simpliﬁed to a double\nbroken line model based on the idea of piecewise linearity\naccording to the IEC description method of core excitation\ncharacteristic, as shown by the blue line in FIGURE 6.\nIn order to describe the effect of residual ﬂux, the double\nbroken line is moved longitudinally. When the residual ﬂux\nof the core is positive, the core characteristics are represented\nby the red curve 1. The corresponding characteristic equation\nis as follows:\n\n\n\nφ=1\nR F +φr −φs ≤φ≤φs\nφ= 1\nRs (F −R (φs −φr))+φs φ>φs\nφ= 1\nRs (F +R (φs −φr))−φs φ< −φs\n(6)\nWhen the residual ﬂux of the core is negative, the core\ncharacteristics are represented by the black curve 2.

When it is not saturated, the relative permeability\nof the iron core is very large, there is ur ≈5000 −8000.\nThe excitation characteristics of side yoke and the main yoke\ncan also be described with the simpliﬁed excitation charac-\nteristics described above. After simpliﬁcation, The analytic\nsolution of equation group (3) can be obtained.\n2) MODEL SOLUTION\nIn the process of designing the control parameters of the\nstrategy, it is necessary to solve and analyze the magnetic\nﬂux. In different stages of the control process, the form\nof equations (3) and (5) remains unchanged, but the initial\nconditions of the equations will be different. Taking the pre-\nﬂuxing process of A-phase as an example, the magnetic ﬂux\nof each phase is solved.\nBecause the A-phase is preﬂuxed, the initial conditions is\nthat the residual ﬂux of the three-phase core is φAr,φBr,φCr,\nand the residual ﬂux of the side yoke and the main yoke\nare φ01r φ12r φ23r φ34r φ45r φ50r respectively. The subscript\nnumbers represent the magnetic circuit node numbers.\nA-phase is preﬂuxed at time 0, and the preﬂuxing current\nis IdA. There is FA =NIdA, FB =FC =0. Assuming that\nthe preﬂuxing current does not reach the set value instanta-\nneously, the form of preﬂuxing current is as follows:\nIdA =IdAm\n(\n1 −e−t\nτ\n)\n(8)\nwhere, τ is the time constant of preﬂuxing current, IdAm is\nthe amplitude of preﬂuxing current. When the core is not\nsaturated, the analytical expression of three-phase magnetic\nﬂux is obtained by solving simultaneous equations(3)(5) as\nfollows. \n\n\nφA =−σ1+σ2\n2σ3\nφB =σ4\nσ5\nφC =−σ6+σ7\n2σ3\n(9)\nwhere σ1 =NIdAm (3R2 +8R3)e−t\nτ , σ3 =R2\n2+5R2R3+6R2\n3\nσ2 =−φAr\n(\nR2\n2 +6R2R3 +8R2\n3\n)\n+(φBr +φCr)\n−(R2 +2R3)2 NIdAm (3R2 +8R3)\nσ4 =−NIdAm\n(\n1 −e−t\nτ\n)\n−φArR3 +φBr (R2 +2R3)\n−φCrR3\nσ5 =R2 +3R3\nσ6 =NIdAm (R2 +4R3)\n(\n1-e−t\nτ\n)\nσ7 =(φAr +φBr)(R2 +2R3)2 −φCr\n(\nR2\n2 +6R2R3 +8R2\n3\n)\nThe analytical expression formula of A-phase magnetic\nﬂux is related to the preﬂuxing current, the unsaturated reluc-\ntance of the core and the residual ﬂux of each phase, however\nit is not related to the residual ﬂux of the side yoke and the\nmain yoke through preliminary observation.\nC. PARAMETER DESIGN AND MARGIN ANALYSIS OF\nINRUSH CURRENT SUPPRESSION STRATEGY\nThe basic idea of the preﬂuxing and controlled switching\nstrategy has been described above. The focus now is to design\nthe parameters in the strategy so that the magnetic ﬂux of\neach phase can be within the saturated range during the entire\nclosing process when applying strategy.\n1) PREFLUXING CURRENT AND CLOSING TIME OF A-PHASE\nA-phase is taken as the ﬁrst closing phase. The key factors\naffecting the characteristics of A-phase magnetic ﬂux are\nresidual ﬂux, preﬂuxing current and closing time. The size of\nthe residual ﬂux is not controllable, and only the parameters\nof the preﬂuxing current and closing time can be designed.\nIn order to ensure that the core can be preﬂuxed to saturation\nunder various residual ﬂux modes, there must be a lower\nlimit for the preﬂuxing current, denoted as IdAmL, called the\nreference current. However, the iron core cannot be over sat-\nurated after preﬂuxing, otherwise it will produce large inrush\ncurrent after closing. So, there is an upper limit of preﬂuxing\ncurrent, which is recorded as IdAmH. After preﬂuxing, σ1 can\nbe regarded as 0.\nEquation (9) can be converted to equation (10).\nIdAm =−φArσ8 +(φBr +φCr)σ9 +2φsσ3\nσ10\n(10)\nwhere σ8 =R2\n2 +6R2R3 +8R2\n3,σ9 =(R2 +2R3)2 ,σ10 =\n3R2 +8R3\nIn any residual ﬂux mode, it can be preﬂuxed to saturation\nﬂux, so the lower limit of preﬂuxing current should be the\nmaximum value of IdAm. In most cases, the residual ﬂux of the\ntransformer is generated when the circuit breaker is opened,\nso the magnetic ﬂuxes at the three phases should satisfy the\nrelationship of φA +φB +φC =0. It is substituted in equation\n(10), IdAm can be expressed as follows.\nIdAm =2\n(\nR2\n2 +5R2R3 +6R2\n3\n)\n(φs −φAr)\nN (3R2 +8R3) (11)\nIt is easy to know that IdAm can get the maximum when\nφAr =−0.85φm.\n(IdAm)max 1 =3.5R2\n2 +17.4R2R3 +20.9R2\n3\nN (3R2 +8R3) φs (12)\nThe residual ﬂux of the three-phase core of the transformer\nmay not satisfy the sum of zero, such as after the DC resis-\ntance test. According to the relationship of the reluctance,\nwhen φAr =−0.85φm, φBr =φCr =0.85φm, IdAm achieves\nthe maximum value:\n(IdAm)max 2 =4.2R2\n2 +23.8R2R3 +20.4R2\n3\nN (3R2 +8R3) φs (13)\nVOLUME 9, 2021 38967\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 7. The relationship betweenIdAmH/IdAmL and k.\nThere is no doubt that (IdAm)max 2 ≥(IdAm)max 1, because\nthe latter residual ﬂux mode already includes the mode where\nthe sum of the three-phase residual ﬂux is zero. So, there is\noIdAmL =(IdAm)max 2.\nThe ﬁnal value of the magnetic ﬂux is nϕs after preﬂuxing\nwith the preﬂuxing upper limit current. Assuming n =1.05\nand R2 =kR3, the upper limit of preﬂuxing current can be\nresolved as:\nIdAm\n=\n[\n(2n+8)k2 +(7n+3)k +ur (n−1)(3k +8)+4\n]\nφs\n−\n(\n2k2 +10k +12\n)\nφAr\n(3k +8)N R3\n(14)\nFurther analysis of equation (14) shows that when the ratio\nk of the reluctance of the core column to the reluctance of\nthe side yoke remains unchanged, both IdAmH and IdAmL\nare proportional to the reluctance R3. Therefore, the ratio\nof IdAmH/IdAmL remains unchanged. For transformers with\ndifferent core sizes, k may change, which may have a certain\nimpact on the preﬂuxing current. The relationship between\nIdAmH/IdAmL and k is shown in FIGURE 7 when k is changed.\nAs it can be seen from the above ﬁgure, IdAmH/IdAmLis\nlittle affected by k. Actually, the commonly used core struc-\nture k does not exceed 10. At this time, IdAmH/IdAmL is\nbasically maintained at 60 in size. When k = 0, it corre-\nsponds to the situation of three phases transformer with single\nphase core. At this time, there is also IdAmH/IdAmL =60.\nTherefore, under different core structure types and core sizes,\nIdAmH/IdAmL is a very large value. It shows that the upper\nlimit of preﬂuxing current is not high. The reason that there\nis such a wide range is mainly the saturation characteristics\nof the core itself. That is, after the magnetic circuit is satu-\nrated, the reluctance increases sharply. With only a modest\nﬂux increase beyond saturation, very high magnitude current\npulses will be needed.\nA certain type of 220kV three phases and ﬁve columns\ntransformer is taken as an example to design the control\nparameters and analyze the parameter margin. The core\nmaterial is a 0.3mm thick silicon steel sheet produced by\nJapan’s Nippon Steel Corporation, and the basic parameters\nare shown in Figure 25 and Table 2.\nGenerally, the rated working magnetic density of iron core\nis 1.7T, and the saturation magnetic density is about (1.15\n∼1.25Bm). Here, 1.15 Bm is taken, i.e.,1.96T. When the\nTABLE 1. The influence of residual flux on different the inrush current\nreduction strategies.\nactual parameters are taken into account, the solution can be\nobtained as follows:\nIdAmL=12.2A (15)\nThe reference current is about 1.93% of the rated current,\nclosing to the rated excitation current, but far less than the\nrated current.\nIt can be seen from the above analysis that when the\ndetailed parameters of transformer core are known, the cur-\nrent range required for preﬂuxing can be accurately calcu-\nlated, and then the parameters of preﬂuxing equipment can\nbe selected according to the actual situation. Even if the\naccurate core parameters cannot be obtained, because the\nreference current is close to the rated excitation current, and\nthe preﬂuxing range is large, the median value of the range\ncan be selected. That is to say that the DC current of 30 times\nthe rated excitation current can be selected as the preﬂuxing\ncurrent.\nWhen the residual ﬂux of A-phase is the worst, the refer-\nence current with the size of IdAmL and a time constant of 5ms\nis used to preﬂux. The three-phase magnetic density B can be\nobtained by solving equation(9), as shown in FIGURE 6.\nFor transformers with different core structures, when the\nA-phase winding is preﬂuxed with reference current, the A-\nphase magnetic ﬂux can reach the saturation value. So,\nthe correctness of the preﬂuxing parameter design method is\nveriﬁed.\nThe closing time of A-phase is analyzed. When the A-\nphase preﬂuxing reaches the saturation value, the closing\ntime of A-phase power supply is selected at phase 180 ◦.\nAccording to equation(2), the calculation equation of A-\nphase magnetic ﬂux after closing is obtained.\nφA =φm cos(ωt) +(φs −φm)e−R\nL t (16)\nIt can be seen that the A-phase ﬂux will not exceed the\nsaturation value. Therefore, there is no inrush after A-phase\nclosing. Therefore, the optimal closing angle of A-phase is\n38968 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\n180 ◦. In order to shorten the closing time as far as possible,\nthe corresponding optimal closing time tA can be selected\nabout two power frequency cycles after the completion of A-\nphase preﬂuxing.\nIn the actual situation, it is often impossible to achieve\nprecise angle closing due to the dispersion of the breaker\nresulted from the wear of the mechanical breaking process\nand the inﬂuence of factors such as pre-breakdown. Under\nnormal circumstances, the offset time caused by dispersion\ndoes not exceed ±1ms.\nIt is assumed that the A-phase offset angle is δ1. According\nto equation (2), the aperiodic component of magnetic ﬂux\ncaused by offset is equation (17).\nφf =(φr −φm cos (δ1))e−R\nL t (17)\nThen the maximum magnetic ﬂux after closing is as fol-\nlows.\nφmax =φm +φr −φm cos (δ1) (18)\nTo achieve, through calculation, −36◦ ≤δ1 ≤36◦must\nbe met. In other word, if the offset time of the circuit breaker\nis within ±2ms, the magnetic ﬂux can be controlled in the\nsaturation range. Therefore, the dispersion of the closing time\nof the circuit breaker has little inﬂuence on the inrush current\nreduction effect under the strategy.\n2) PREFLUXING PARAMETERS AND CLOSING TIME OF\nB-PHASE\nAfter the A-phase is closed, the B-phase and C-phase will\nproduce induced magnetic ﬂux due to coupling. The magnetic\nﬂux characteristics in the process of B-phase preﬂuxing and\ncontrolled switching are mainly affected by ‘‘core ﬂux equal-\nization’’ effect, A-phase magnetic ﬂux, B-phase preﬂuxing\ncurrent and preﬂuxing time, B-phase closing time, etc. These\nfactors need to be analyzed one by one.\nAnalysis of the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect. The clos-\ning strategy based on the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect\nis proposed [1]. However, when the ‘‘core ﬂux equaliza-\ntion’’ effect is not obvious, whether the strategy is applicable\nneeded to be further analyzed.\nIf the initial magnetic ﬂux of the B-phase and C-phase is\ndifferent. The residual ﬂux of B-phase is positive and C-phase\nis negative. After the A-phase is closed, the B-phase and C-\nphase will couple out the induced magnetic ﬂux that follows\nthe A-phase magnetic ﬂux change. If the small hysteresis\nloop of the iron core has an obvious local saturation area as\nshown in FIGURE 9(a), the inductance at the beginning of\nB-phase is signiﬁcantly greater than that of C-phase. In the\ntransformer of Y 0/1 connection mode, the same current\nwill ﬂow in the triangular winding, which will cause uneven\nvoltage distribution on the BC phase winding. B-phase will\ninduce a higher voltage due to higher inductance, so that\nthe magnetic ﬂux of B-phase increases rapidly, while the\nmagnetic ﬂux of C-phase changes slowly. Eventually the\nBC phase magnetic ﬂux will be equal. This phenomenon is\nFIGURE 8. Three-phase magnetic density when A-phase is prefluxed.\ncalled the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect, which can quickly\neliminate the inﬂuence of residual ﬂux. If this phenomenon\noccurs in the core, the B-phase and C-phase ﬂux will satisfy\nφB =φC = −1\n2 φA. Therefore, it is thought that the best\nclosing angle of B-phase and C-phase can be generated after\ntwo power frequency cycles after A-phase is closed [1], [19].\nSo controlled switching is adopted to reduce the inrush cur-\nrent of B-phase and C-phase effectively.\nThe above analysis shows that the condition for the pro-\nduction of the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect. The condition\nis that the generated small hysteresis loop has an obvious\nsaturation section, such as the purple area in the B-phase and\nC-phase magnetic ﬂux in FIGURE 9(a).\nHowever, in fact, there is that the local small hysteresis loop\nsaturation section is not obvious, when the core material does\nnot undergo steady-state saturation. For example, the core\nmaterial is a core material with low hysteresis loss, or the\nmagnetic ﬂux in the B-phase and C-phase is very small.\nAt this time, the excitation inductance of B-phase and\nC-phase is very large during the whole preﬂuxing process,\nand the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect will not be obvious,\nas shown in FIGURE 9 (b). At this time, after the closing of\nA-phase, the ﬂux of B-phase and C-phase will be difﬁcult\nto reach equilibrium. Therefore, the strategy based on the\n‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect in references [1], [19] may\nfail, which is further demonstrated below.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 38969\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 9. The ‘‘core flux equalization’’ effect of Y0/1 connection\ntransformer.\nThe simpliﬁed hysteresis loop model is used to solve the\nmagnetic ﬂux of each phase after A-phase closing. After the\nclosing of A-phase, the magnetic ﬂux changes according to\nthe sinusoidal law. So in the magnetic circuit model, the A-\nphase branch will become an equivalent current source, and\nthere is FB =FC =0. The equivalent magnetic circuit of\nthree phases and ﬁve columns transformer is solved, and the\nresults are shown in FIGURE 10. The induced magnetic ﬂux\nof B-phase and C-phase is also changed according to the sine\nlaw, but the phase is opposite to that of A-phase. Obviously,\nthe difference between B-phase and C-phase ﬂuxes is very\nstable, and the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect is not obvious.\nThe magnetic ﬂux of each phase after preﬂuxing is\nφA1 φB1 φC1. After preﬂuxing of A-phase, the magnetic ﬂux\nchange of each phase is analyzed, as shown in equation (19).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1φA1 =φA1 −φAr = NIdAm (3R2 +8R3)\n2\n(\nR2\n2 +5R2R3 +6R2\n3\n)\n1φB1 =φB1 −φBr = −NIdAm\nR2 +3R3\n1φC1 =φC1 −φCr =− NIdAm (R2 +4R3)\n2\n(\nR2\n2 +5R2R3 +6R2\n3\n)\n(19)\nFIGURE 10. Three-phase magnetic flux during the prefluxing and\ncontrolled switching process of A-phase.\nThe ratio of the ﬂux change of B-phase and C-phase to that\nof A-phase after preﬂuxing is as follows.\nkB =1φB1\n1φA1\n=−2R2 +4R3\n3R2 +8R3\n,\nkC =1φC1\n1φA1\n=− R2 +4R3\n3R2 +8R3\n(20)\nIt can be seen that kB,kC has nothing to do with the\nresidual ﬂux and preﬂuxing current of each phase, but only\nrelated to the relative ratio of reluctance. The result shows\nthat the magnetic ﬂux of B-phase and C-phase is related to\nthe core reluctance and the initial residual ﬂux of the three-\nphase when the A-phase is preﬂuxed. By analogy, it can\nbe seen that the magnetic ﬂux of B-phase and C-phase is\nclosely related to the residual ﬂux of each phase after A-phase\nis energized. Because of the randomness of residual ﬂux,\nthe optimal closing angle of the B-phase and C-phase will be\ndifﬁcult to determine. Therefore, the method of designing the\noptimal closing time based on the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’\neffect in reference is likely to fail [19], which will be veriﬁed\nin subsequent simulations. In order to solve the problem,\nthe method that preﬂux the B-phase to the saturated magnetic\nﬂux to generate the optimal closing angle is proposed. This\nmethod is still applicable when the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’\neffect is not obvious.\nDesign the preﬂuxing parameters and closing time. It can\nbe seen from FIGURE 10 that when the A-phase magnetic\nﬂux decreases, the B-phase magnetic ﬂux increases. There-\nfore, when the A-phase magnetic ﬂux is at the positive peak\nvalue and the B-phase is preﬂuxed, the superposition of the\npreﬂuxing effect and the magnetic ﬂux interphase coupling\neffect will be more conducive to the saturation magnetic ﬂux\nof the B-phase. and to the production of the optimal closing\nangle of the B-phase. Therefore, the optimal preﬂuxing time\nis the time when the A-phase magnetic ﬂux is maximum,\nwhich corresponds to the 60 ◦of B phase power.\nThe magnetic ﬂux of B-phase preﬂuxing and closing pro-\ncess are solved and analyzed. Assume that the initial mag-\nnetic ﬂuxes of the three phases before preﬂuxing of B-phase\n38970 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nare φAr2,φBr2,φCr2. From the analysis of the magnetic ﬂux\nchange of the A-phase preﬂuxing stage, it can be seen that\nbefore the B phase is preﬂuxed, even if φAr2 has been deter-\nmined, the initial magnetic ﬂux of the B-phase and C-phase is\nuncertain. The preﬂuxing time is tB1. The deviation between\nthe actual preﬂuxing time and the ideal preﬂuxing time is\n1t (electrical angle is δ). The preﬂuxing current is IdB, and\nFB =NIdB, FC =0. A-phase magnetic ﬂux is a ﬁxed value,\nsee (16).\nRefer to A-phase preﬂuxing parameter design conclusion,\nthe characteristic of the B-phase core is the same as those\nof the A-phase. Therefore, when B-phase is preﬂuxed, the\npreﬂuxing current can also be chosen the same as A-phase. In\nthis way, the parameters of the A-phase and B-phase preﬂux-\ning equipment can be exactly the same, which can simplify\nthe preﬂuxing design process. The feasibility of this size\nof preﬂuxing current will be demonstrated below. Because\nthe preﬂuxing process is relatively short, the magnetic ﬂux\nattenuation is not considered in this process. The three-phase\nmagnetic ﬂux is resolved as follows:\nφA =φm cos(ωt +δ) +φs −φm\nφB =φFB −(1 −σ8)φm cos(ωt +δ) −σ8φm cos δ\n+φm −φs −φCr2\nφC =−φFB +σ8φm (cos δ) −cos(ωt +δ))+φCr2 (21)\nAmong them, σ8 = (R2\n2+4R2R3+4R2\n3)\n2R2\n2+9R2R3+8R2\n3\n, φFB =\nNIdAm\n2R3\n(\n1-e−t\nτ\n)\n. σ8 is a constant. φFB is the magnetic ﬂux\nproduced by the B-phase preﬂuxing current.\nBecause φBr2 and φCr2 are both uncertain parameters, it is\nnecessary to discuss whether magnetic ﬂux of B-phase can\nmeet the requirements of preﬂuxing to saturation under any\nφBr2 and φCr2. It can be seen from equation (21) that when\nφCr2 is the largest, the preﬂuxing speed of B-phase is the\nslowest, which is the least conducive to B-phase saturation.\nBecause φBr2 ≥ −0.85φs and the sum of the three-phase\nmagnetic ﬂux is 0, φCr2 gets the maximum,i.e., φCr2 = 0\nwhen φAr2 =0. Core parameters and preﬂuxing parameters\nare substituted to solve equation (21), the three-phase mag-\nnetic ﬂux can be obtained as shown in FIGURE 11.\nIt can be seen that in the case where the initial residual\nﬂux has the most unfavorable effect, the B-phase magnetic\nﬂux can also be preﬂuxed to a saturation value within 5ms,\nand then maintain the saturation state for about 10ms. After\nthis cycle, such a saturated state will circulate in each cycle.\nThe phase angle of the B-phase voltage of 180 ◦corresponds\nto tB2 just within the range of the saturation state of the phase.\nAccording to the equation (2), when the B-phase power sup-\nply is closed at tB2, the B-phase iron core magnetic ﬂux will\nnot be saturated. So the B-phase hardly generates inrush cur-\nrent. In order to reduce the mutual interference between the\npreﬂuxing and controlled switching process, and to improve\nthe efﬁciency of the closing process, it is considered to close\nB-phase within 1-2 cycles after the preﬂuxing. Of course,\nif the site does not require high closing time, the interval time\nFIGURE 11. B-Phase prefluxing under the worst case of initial magnetic\nflux.\nFIGURE 12. The influence of different prefluxing time on B-phase\nprefluxing.\ncan be delayed according to the actual situation. See the tB2\nlabel in FIGURE 11.\nThe time margin of B-phase preﬂuxing is analyzed. The B-\nphase preﬂuxing process is simulated within 60 ◦≤δ≤60◦,\nas shown in FIGURE 12.\nIt can be seen from the above that when the preﬂux-\ning angle deviation range is −60◦ ≤ δ ≤ 60◦, the\n180◦(t′\nB2 t′′\nB2 t′′′\nB2 in the FIGURE 12) of B-phase power is\nwithin the B-phase magnetic ﬂux saturation time interval.\nTherefore, under the larger error of preﬂuxing time, there is\nan optimal closing angle for B-phase.\nBecause the initial magnetic ﬂux state during closing of B-\nphase is exactly the same as those of A-phase, the effect of\nthe dispersion of the B phase breaker on the magnetic ﬂux\nafter closing is exactly the same as that of A-phase. Then\nthe dispersion margin of the circuit breaker of this phase\nis consistent with the A-phase. Using the magnetic circuit\nparameters corresponding to the three phases transformer\nwith single phase core, the magnetic ﬂux in the B-phase\npreﬂuxing and controlled switching process of the structure\ntransformer is solved and analyzed. It is found that the pre-\nﬂuxing parameters and preﬂuxing time of B-phase selected in\nVOLUME 9, 2021 38971\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 13.

So,\nit will not be repeated here.\nD. C-PHASE CLOSING TIME\nAfter the A-phase and B-phase is closed, the magnetic ﬂux of\nthem is φA =φm cos(ωt) +φs −φm and φB =φm cos(ωt −\n120◦) +φs −φm respectively. Then due to the balance of\nthe three-phase magnetic ﬂux, the C-phase magnetic ﬂux is\nsolved as follows.\nφC =φm cos(ωt +120◦) +2φm −2φs (22)\nBecause φs = 1.15φm, the maximum amplitude of C-\nphase magnetic ﬂux is 1.13φ s. Therefore, the C-phase mag-\nnetic ﬂux will be slightly saturated. However, it can be seen\nfrom equation (22) that the C-phase magnetic ﬂux induced\nmakes the C-phase induced voltage completely equal to the\nC-phase power supply voltage before the C-phase is closed.\nTherefore, the inrush current generated by the C-phase circuit\nbreaker closed is the same at any closing time. Then is no need\nto preﬂux C-phase. The closing angle of B-phase is consistent\nwith A-phase and B-phase, i.e., the C-phase power supply is\nclosed at 180 ◦. The closing time tC of C-phase can is selected\n1-2 cycles delay from the closing of B-phase.\nThe silicon steel sheet 30Z120 produced by Nippon Steel\nhas a rated magnetic density of 1.7T and a maximum core\nresidual ﬂux of 1.4T. The initial residual ﬂux coefﬁcient (the\nratio of the initial residual ﬂux to the magnetic ﬂux at the time\nof breaker opening) is about 82%. The steady-state residual\nﬂux coefﬁcient (the ratio of steady-state residual ﬂux to initial\nresidual ﬂux) is approximately 80% [15]. When the mag-\nnetic ﬂux is preﬂuxed to saturation, the preﬂuxing current is\nremoved, and the residual ﬂux is about 1.3T. Therefore, when\nusing this preﬂuxing strategy and considering the attenuation\ncharacteristics of residual ﬂux, the magnetic density will\nexceed the saturation magnetic density by 0.1T. There will\nbe very weak saturation, but no large inrush current will be\ngenerated.\nBased on the above analysis of magnetic ﬂux, the key\ncontrol parameters in the strategy are designed. The summary\nof the entire preﬂuxing and controlled switching process is\nshown in FIGURE 13.\nIII. SIMULATION VERIFICATION AND EFFECTIVENESS\nANALYSIS\nBased on the simpliﬁed magnetic circuit model, the magnetic\nﬂux is analyzed and the reduction strategy of inrush current\nFIGURE 14. Transformer simulation model verification.\nFIGURE 15. The prefluxing and controlled switching circuit.\nis proposed in above. Based on PSCAD, this section will\nverify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and analyze the\ninﬂuence of different factors on the strategy effect.\nA. VERIFICATION OF MODEL ACCURACY\nPSCAD is a widely used electromagnetic transient simula-\ntion platform. The classic transformer model in PSCAD can\nsimulate magnetic ﬂux leakage and loss. The latest version\ncan use the widely recognized J-A model to describe the core\nhysteresis characteristics and residual ﬂux. In order to accu-\nrately reﬂect the inrush current characteristics of transformer\nin simulation, the different layout of transformer windings is\nconsidered and the model by parameter compensation is fur-\nther improved [29]. The accuracy of the improved model was\nveriﬁed by dynamic simulation tests. The same simulation\nmodel as the dynamic simulation system is built. A closing\nangle of 90 ◦and a power supply voltage of 790V is chosen.\nThe simulation and test waveforms obtained are shown in the\nﬁgure below.\nIt can be seen that the simulated waveform and the test\nwaveform are in good agreement, and the same phenomenon\noccurs at other closing angles and power supply voltages.\nTherefore, the improved model can be used to accurately\nsimulate the magnetic ﬂux in the three-phase core.\n38972 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 16. Comparison of magnetic flux theory and simulation solution\nin strategy.\nFrom the time of A-phase closing to the B-phase preﬂux-\ning, the magnetic ﬂux of the iron core was solved theoreti-\ncally and simulated separately. The preﬂuxing and controlled\nswitching circuit used in the simulation is shown in FIGURE\n15. The basic parameters such as transformer short-circuit\nimpedance are shown in Table 2. Before B-phase preﬂuxing,\nset the initial magnetic density of the three phases is 1pu\n−0.5pu −0.5pu, and the preﬂuxing current is 12.2A. The\nresults of the two methods are shown in FIGURE 16.\nIt can be seen from the comparison in FIGURE 16,\nthe magnetic ﬂux solved by the simulation changes more\nsmoothly at the inﬂection point of the magnetization curve.\nThis is caused by the use of the J-A model in the simulation\nmodel. However, the magnetic ﬂux obtained by the simpliﬁed\nmagnetic circuit and the magnetic ﬂux obtained by the accu-\nrate simulation have a very high degree of ﬁt, which veriﬁes\nthe accuracy of the magnetic ﬂux analysis method proposed\nin this paper.\nB. THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT FACTORS ON THE\nSTRATEGY EFFECT\n1) THE ‘‘CORE FLUX EQUALIZATION’’ EFFECT\nReference [1] uses the ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect to ﬁnd\nthe optimal closing angle under the condition of known the\nresidual ﬂux of A-phase. In fact, for different core materials,\nthe ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect is also different. It is\nconvenient to simulate the hysteresis loops of iron cores of\ndifferent materials by setting the parameters of the J-A model.\nThereby, different types of ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect\ncan be simulated. It is found through simulation that the ‘‘core\nﬂux equalization’’ effect is more obvious when the core loss\nis high. At this time, the inrush current reduction strategy\nproposed in reference [1] and the strategy proposed in this\narticle both have great effect. The maximum amplitude of the\ninrush current does not exceed 0.01pu, shown as follows.\nHowever, when the core loss is small, the ‘‘core ﬂux equal-\nization’’ effect is not obvious, and the magnetic ﬂux of B-\nphase and C may not be balanced for a long time. Set the\nthree-phase initial residual ﬂux to 0.7pu −0.35pu −0.35pu\nand the comparison of the reduction effects of the two strate-\ngies is shown in FIGURE 18. It can be seen that when the\nFIGURE 17. Comparison of inrush current reduction effects of the two\nstrategies under the obvious ‘‘core flux equalization’’ effect.\nFIGURE 18. Comparison of inrush current reduction effects of the two\nstrategies when the ‘‘core flux equalization’’ effect is not obvious.\nstrategy proposed in reference [1] is adopted, the maximum\ninrush current reaches more than 0.6pu. But when the strat-\negy proposed in this paper is adopted, the maximum inrush\ncurrent is only 0.1pu.\n2) TYPICAL RESIDUAL FLUX\nIn the above theoretical analysis, the inrush current reduction\nstrategy proposed in this paper considers the worst case of\nresidual ﬂux when calculating the preﬂuxing current. To ver-\nify its effectiveness, sets of typical residual ﬂux combinations\nare set up below, and the simulation results are shown in\nTABLE 1.\nIt can be seen from TABLE 1 that when there is no inrush\ncurrent reduction measure, the maximum value of inrush\ncurrent is random, and the maximum can reach 8 pu. When\nadopting the strategy proposed in reference [1], the maximum\nvalue of inrush current is nearly 1.4 pu, but with the change of\nresidual ﬂux, the maximum value of inrush current ﬂuctuates\ngreatly. After adopting the inrush current reduction strategy\nbased on the preﬂuxing and controlled switching proposed\nin this paper, the maximum value of inrush current does\nnot exceed 0.5 pu, which is very stable and not affected by\nresidual ﬂux.\n3) PREFLUXING TIME\nTheoretical analysis shows that when the deviation between\nthe actual preﬂuxing time and the ideal preﬂuxing time is\nwithin the range of (−60 ◦,60◦), there is an optimal closing\nangle for B-phase. FIGURE 19 shows the inrush current\nunder different deviations obtained through simulation.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 38973\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 19. The influence of the angle deviation of B-phase prefluxing on\ninrush current reduction effect.\nFIGURE 20. The influence of the dispersion of circuit breakers on inrush\ncurrent reduction effect.\nIt can be seen from FIGURE 19 that when the deviation\nangle is within the range of (−60 ◦,60◦), the three-phase\ninrush current is kept at a very small value.\n4) THE DISPERSION OF CIRCUIT BREAKER\nTheoretical analysis points out that when −36◦≤δ1 ≤36◦,\nthe dispersion of the circuit breaker has little effect on the\ninrush current reduction. The simulation result is shown in\nFIGURE 20.\nIt can be seen from FIGURE 20 that the magnitude of the\ninrush current has a parabolic relationship with the error angle\nof the circuit breaker. As the error angle of the circuit breaker\nincreases, the maximum of the inrush current will increase.\nBut as long as it stays within the range of (−40 ◦,40◦),\nthe maximum of the three-phase inrush current will not\nexceed the rated current, which veriﬁes the correctness of\nthe above theoretical analysis and shows that the strategy\nproposed in this paper has greater tolerance to the dispersion\nof circuit breakers.\nIn summary, in the case of different residual ﬂux com-\nbinations, considering the dispersion of the circuit breaker,\nthe reduction strategy proposed in this paper has a signiﬁcant\ninrush current reduction effect, which has obvious advantages\ncompared with the common controlled switching inrush cur-\nrent reduction strategy.\nIV. ANALYSIS ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF PROTECTION\nPERFORMANCE BY STRATEGY\nDifferential protections of transformer itself and the adjacent\ncomponents may malfunction because of the large inrush\ncurrent or the corresponding inrush current generated dur-\ning the energization of the transformer. And the unbalanced\ncomponent in the inrush current may cause the zero-sequence\nprotection of the transformer itself and adjacent components\nto malfunction. Under the strategy proposed in this article,\nthe inrush current can be effectively reduced, which can\navoid the problem of related protection malfunction or miss\ntrip caused by the inrush current, thereby improving the\nprotection performance. Taking the transformer differential\nprotection as an example, the analysis is as follows.\nAs the main protection of the transformer, the differential\nprotection can quickly remove the fault within tens of mil-\nliseconds when the fault occurs, and provide reliable protec-\ntion to the transformer. And its malfunction should be avoided\nas much as possible when the transformer is closed.\nIn engineering, restraint criteria such as the 2nd harmonic\nrestraint criteria is widely used to achieve this goal. However,\nwhen the transformer is energized to a small turn-to-turn\nfault, the current in the closing circuit is dominated by inrush\ncurrent, which makes the fault characteristics very weak.\nDue to the existence of the restraint criteria, the differential\nprotection is still braked, and the fault can only be removed\nafter the inrush current decays to a small value. The fault has\nfurther developed, and the time to remove the fault is basically\nmore than 100 milliseconds, causing serious damage to the\ntransformer and threatening the safe and stable operation of\nthe power grid.\nThe inﬂuence of the paper’s strategy on the differential\nprotection when the transformer is energized in no-fault and\nsmall inter-turn fault condition will be analyzed as follows.\nA. CLOSED IN NO FAULT CONDITION\nIn the preﬂuxing stage, according to the parameter design\nanalysis, the preﬂuxing current will be much smaller than the\nrated current. The operating threshold of the transformer dif-\nferential protection setting is generally greater than 0.2 times\nthe rated current. Therefore, the differential protection will\nnot malfunction during the preﬂuxing process.\nIn the closing phase after the preﬂuxing is completed.\nWhen there is no fault, each phase of the core magnetic ﬂux\ncan be preﬂuxed to saturation value. Therefore, when the\nclosing angle is 180 ◦, the iron core will not be deeply sat-\nurated, thereby the inrush current can be effectively reduced\nand the differential protection will not malfunction.\nB. CLOSED IN SMALL INTER-TURN FAULT CONDITION\nFor the preﬂuxing process, it can be seen from the previous\nanalysis that the preﬂuxing current will not exceed the dif-\nferential protection threshold value, so the protection will not\noperate. Because the preﬂuxing current is too small, it will\nnot have a bad effect on the preﬂuxing equipment and the\ntransformer, even if the protection does not operate.\nFor the closing process, because the strategy in this arti-\ncle uses single-phase preﬂuxing and single-phase closing, a\nsingle-phase circuit can be used to analyze the preﬂuxing and\ncontrolled switching process. Take A-phase fault analysis as\n38974 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 21. Closing circuit corresponding to A-phase turn-to-ground fault.\nFIGURE 22. Prefluxing circuit in the case of A-phase turn-to-turn fault.\nan example. There are two main types of weak internal faults\nin the transformer: turn-to-turn fault and turn-to-ground fault.\nThe turn-to-turn fault can be converted into a turn-to-ground\nfault for analysis [30]. So the fault characteristics of turn-to-\nground fault is mainly analyzed.\nWhen a turn-to-ground fault occurs, the no-load trans-\nformer becomes an autotransformer with a load. The load\nis the transition resistance. The closing circuit is shown in\nFIGURE 21.\nTo analyze the magnetic ﬂux of the transformer under the\nstrategy of this article, and then analyze the fault character-\nistics and its impact on the protection. According to formula\n(2), the A-phase magnetic ﬂux of closing after preﬂuxing is\nas follows:\nφA =φ′\nm cos(ωt) +\n(\nφz −φ′\nm\n)\ne−R\nL t (23)\nφz is the magnetic ﬂux after preﬂuxing of A-phase, and φ′\nm\nis the steady-state magnetic ﬂux after closing.\nThe magnetic ﬂux composition is further analyzed. Dur-\ning preﬂuxing process, since the preﬂuxing current is DC\nthe preﬂuxing current is mainly distributed according to the\nresistance. At this time, the preﬂuxing branch is in a short-\ncircuit state, as shown in FIGURE 22.\nTherefore, the preﬂuxing current will all ﬂow through\nthe excitation branch, which is the same as the preﬂuxing\nsituation when there is no fault. According to the linear\nrelationship between magnetic ﬂux and current, there are:\nφz =φs (24)\nAfter the A-phase is closed, the steady-state excitation cur-\nrent is ˙I′m. According to closing circuit showed in FIGURE\n22, ˙I′m can be obtained as follows:\n˙I′m = (Rf +jωL2σ)//jωLm\njω(Ls +L1σ)+R1σ +(Rf +jωL2σ)//jωLm\n·\n×\n˙Um\njωLm\n(25)\nAmong them, Rf is the transition resistance of the turn-to-\nground fault. It has been converted to the value of the primary\nside.\nFIGURE 23. Magnetic flux during the prefluxing and controlled switching\nprocess under normal and fault conditions.\nFIGURE 24. With or without inrush reduction strategy, the protection\noperation when the transformer is energized in small turn-to-ground\nfault condition.\nAssuming that when the transformer is operating nor-\nmally, the steady-state magnetic ﬂux amplitude is φm, cor-\nresponding to the steady-state excitation current ˙Im. ˙Im can\nbe obtained as follows:\n˙Im = jωLm\njω(Ls +L1σ)+R1σ +jωLm\n·\n˙Um\njωLm\n(26)\nDue to R1σ ≪ω(Ls +L1σ), and\n|(Rf +jωL2σ)//jωLm|<ωLm,\n⏐⏐˙I′m\n⏐\n⏐<\n⏐\n⏐˙Im\n⏐\n⏐can be analyzed\naccording to formulas(25)(26). According to the linear rela-\ntionship between magnetic ﬂux and current, there must be\nφ′\nm <φm.\nThe above analysis shows that if there is a preﬂuxing\nand controlled switching strategy, the maximum value of the\npositive magnetic ﬂux of the A-phase is also φs. So the iron\ncore will not be positively saturated.\nAccording to equation (23), the minimum value of mag-\nnetic ﬂux after closing is φz −2φ′\nm. According to φm ≈\n0.87φs and φ′\nm < φm, there must be (φ z −2φ′\nm) > −φs,\nso the iron core will not be negative polarity saturated.\nFIGURE 23 shows the comparison of the magnetic ﬂux\nchanges between normal and fault conditions when both\nuse this closing strategy. It can be seen that after adopting\nthis strategy, the iron core will not be saturated during the\nwhole process of transformer closing, and the transformer\nclosing circuit will be exactly the same as the circuit when the\ntransformer is short-circuited during steady-state operation.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 38975\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nFIGURE 25. Schematic of 220kV three phases and five columns transformer core size.\nFIGURE 26. Turn-to-ground fault protection operation when closing at 22% turns ratio.\nTABLE 2. 220kV three phases and five columns transformer core size.\nTABLE 3. Electromagnetic parameters of a typical 220kV three phases and five columns transformer.\nTherefore, the nature and size of the fault current generated\nby the two working condition should also be the same. That\nis, its second harmonic ratio is low, and the differential pro-\ntection will not be braked due to closing. It’s veriﬁed by\nsimulation as follows.\nC. VERIFIED BY SIMULATION\nSet a small turn-to-ground fault on the primary side of the\ntransformer for simulation. The short-circuit turns ratio is\n4.5%, and the transition resistance is 2. The simulation\nresult is shown in the ﬁgure below.\n38976 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Panet al.: Three-Phase Transformer Inrush Current Reduction Strategy\nIt can be seen that the fault current is very slight, about\n0.15IN, but it exceeds the protection operation threshold.\nWhen adopting this strategy, there is almost no inrush current,\nand the protection can instantly remove the fault. When there\nis no inrush current reduction strategy, the three phases will\nbe closed at random residual ﬂux and random angles. The\ntransformer will generate a large inrush current. The second\nharmonic attenuation is relatively slow. So, the protection is\nto be braked for a long time. The fault can be removed after\nat least 7s. Other turns ratio simulation is shown in Figure 25.\nIt all shows that when there is the strategy, the differential\nprotection can also operate faster when the transformer is\nenergized in the small turn-to-ground fault condition.\nIn summary, the simulation analysis shows that when the\npreﬂuxing and controlled switching strategy is adopted in\nthis paper, even if the transformer is closed to a slight fault,\nthe transformer core will not be saturated. The inrush current\ncan be effectively reduced, and the slight fault characteristics\ncan be well reserved. Therefore, for differential protection,\nthe protection can trip quickly, which improves the sensitivity\nand quick operation of the protection.\nV. CONCLUSION\nBased on the principle of inrush current reduction, this paper\nproposes the inrush current reduction strategy of based on\nthe preﬂuxing and controlled switching technology. By con-\nstructing an equivalent magnetic circuit model suitable for\nlarge-capacity transformers, an analytical expression of the\nmagnetic ﬂux when implementing the strategy is obtained.\nBased on the analysis, the design method of the control\nparameters such as the preﬂuxing current and the optimal\nclosing angle of each phase power supply is given. The\ninﬂuence of factors such as the dispersion of the circuit\nbreaker, the deviation of preﬂuxing time and the residual ﬂux\non the reduction effect of the strategy is comprehensively\nanalyzed. Finally, through accurate inrush current simulation,\nthe correctness and superiority of the strategy are explained.\nThe results show that the strategy has the following charac-\nteristics:\n1) The proposed strategy is suitable for three phases trans-\nformer with ﬁve columns core or single phase core. In fact,\nit is also applicable to transformers such as three phases and\nthree columns structure transformer. It is only need to change\nthe boundary conditions to design speciﬁc parameters.\n2) The required basic preﬂuxing current is small, and the\ncurrent selection range is large. At 1 to 60 times the preﬂuxing\nreference current, the magnetic ﬂux can be preﬂuxed to an\nideal saturation state.\n3) Not affected by residual ﬂux and ‘‘core ﬂux equaliza-\ntion’’ effect, this strategy can reduce the inrush current to less\nthan 0.5 times the rated current under any working conditions\nwhere residual ﬂux and ‘‘core ﬂux equalization’’ effect are\nnot obvious.\n4) It has good tolerance to the deviation of preﬂuxing time\nand the dispersion of circuit breakers, which improves the\npossibility of strategic engineering application.\n5) This strategy can still reduce the inrush current well\nwhen the transformer is energized in the small turn-to-ground\nfault condition. So, the sensitivity and speed of operation\nof related protections such as differential protection can be\nimproved effectively.\nAPPENDIX\nSee Figure 25 and 26.\nSee Table 2 and 3.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
