INTRODUCTION \n \nIn an ever more globalized world, manufacturing \nenterprises are facing growing challenges in terms of \ncompetition, volatile markets and a turbulent envi–\nronment [1]. At a time of rising costs, time pressures in \nproduction and globalization in general, plant layout and \nlogistics are among the key factors for the success of the \ncompany [2]. If the company wants to stay competitive \nit must continuously increase its efficiency on all fields \nof manufacturing [3]. Nowadays, the three most impor–\ntant characteristics of a company are: economy, \nreliability in meeting the deadlines, and flexibility \n(Figure 1.) [4]. \n \nFigure 1. Main characteristics of a manufacturing company \n[4] \nUnfortunately, these three characteristics are \ncontradictory. The higher the reliability of deadlines and \nflexibility are, the more difficult is economical \nproduction at a fixed price. On the other hand, if the \ncompany economy is the most  important characteristic, \nthen it is difficult to meet the deadlines and to be \nflexible. The next important characteristic is to be up-to-\ndate. If a company does not use IT-supported data \nacquisition, then the data are not up to date. Also, due to \nthe reduction of product life cycles and the fast \nchanging global demands, production and factory \nplanning cycles become shorter. Agile enterprise \nstructures are necessary to manage ongoing changes [5]. \nBecause of all mentioned above, the company must \noperate fast under a new scenario and needs to have a \nreview of the current situation about [4]: \n• where and what is going on, \n• where the problems occurred, \n• where the delays occurred, \n• what functioned better than planned. \nAt every moment, the company knows its status \nregarding capacities, materials and costs. Consequently \nit is possible to make new plans quickly, taking into \naccount customer satisfaction and economy. \nThe paper shows the steps th at are necessary for the \ntransition from the existing to the optimal layout of \nworkspaces and equipment. Bloch-Schmigalla \ntriangular method is used for the optimization.  \n \n2. PLANT LAYOUT OPTIMIZATION \n \nSpending a little time to plan the arrangement before \ninstallation can prevent unnecessary losses [6, 7]. \nPlanning the production plant layout at the outset before \nbuilding the plant or office is the best way to reduce the \n286 ▪ VOL. 46, No 2, 2018 FME Transactions\n \ncosts remarkably. Manufacturing products or delivering \nservices at high quality, with less cost and in short time \nusing the fewest resources is the objective of properly \nmanaging a facility [6, 8]. It is important that the \nfacilities must be managed properly in order to attain \nthe objective. Also it is necessary to optimize a \nproduction plant layout in existing factory, if the layout \nisn’t designed correctly. \nThere are many procedures and algorithms that can \nassist facility planners to construct the new layout or \nimprove the current layout such as: Systematic Layout \nPlanning (SLP), Pairwise Exchange Method (PEM), \nGraph Based Theory (GBT), Dimensionless Block \nDiagram (DBD), Total Closeness Rating (TCR), Bloch-\nSchmigalla triangular method, etc [9]. \nOn the basis of research [4, 10, 11] a conclusion was \ndone that the optimization of layout of production \nmeans can be carried out in four steps: \n• Step 1: Description of the manufacturing process, \n• Step 2: Creation of the material flow intensity \nmatrix, \n• Step 3: Description of the existing layout of \nproduction means in the company, \n• Step 4: Proposal of the improved layout of \nproduction means in the company. \nIn this case study, the Bloch-Schmigalla triangular \nmethod is used for the layout optimization of the \nexisting production plant. \n \n3. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXISTING LAYOUT \n \nSpecial transformers and reactors for medium voltages \nproduced by Kon čar D&ST (Distribution and Special \nTransformers) have a long tradition and are well known \nworldwide for number of years. Production program of \nspecial transformers is produced in a separate \nproduction hall, where each process is organized \nespecially for the assembly of special transformers - \nfrom separate hot air drying plants, winding machines \nand oil purification machines for several oil types \n(including mineral oil, synthetic organic ester, silicon \nand vegetable oil) [12]. \nSimplified flow chart of transformer production is \nshown in Figure 2.  \nIn the current production hall there are four \nmachines for winding different types of wires \n(workstations 1 to 4), two dryers (dryer of the active \npart and the electrical dryer), control station and a space \nfor external oil filling and assembling of active parts \nand final assembling. Figure 3 shows 2D layout of the \nproduction hall. Blue circuits are representing \nWorkstations 1 to 4, and transport routs are marked by \nyellow lines. Following the simplified flow chart, this \nproduction hall is suitable for making every step in this \nchart except cutting and stacking a core. Cores are cut \nand stacked  in the separate production hall and they are \ntransported to the place suitable for assembling of the \nactive part in this production hall. \n \nFigure 2.

OPTIMIZATION OF THE SYSTEM LAYOUT \n \nThe goal of the system optimization is to get the optimal \nlayout of the elements in that system. Positioning of the \nelements is based on the ma terial flow. There are two \ncriteria for layout optimizatio n. First criteria are based \non the optimization of material flow direction (the goal \nis to ensure that the material  flow is as linear as it can \nbe). Second criteria are based on minimization of \ntransport distance (total transport intensity). Total \ntransport intensity is a product of the material flow \nintensity and the distance between the elements. \nIn this paper the Bloch-Schmigalla triangular \nmethod is used for optimization of the material flow. \nThe triangular method was developed in 1950. by \nBloch. The goal is to ar range the elements by the \ncriteria of minimum transpor t distance. Bloch's method \nis based on these several principles: \n• If the connection between two elements in the system \nis needed (the elements are connected by some sort of \ntransport), the optimal way to do that is to set both \nelements in terminal positions of the base line. \n• If the connection between three elements is needed \n(the elements are connected by some sort of \ntransport), the shortest way is to put them in the \nvertices of equilateral triangle. \n• The fourth element in the system can be put \nsomewhere on the three possible locations of the \nadjacent equilateral triangles, which result the \nminimum transport cost, etc.  \nThe disadvantage of Bloch's triangular method is \nthat the method does not give the answer to which \nelements should be placed first in the mesh of \nequilateral triangles. H. Sc hmigalla improved Bloch's \nmethod and named that improved method the modified \ntriangle method [13]. The method is extremely useful \nwhen designing new production systems or when \nanalyzing the existing ones th at are confronted with \nchanges during the production process or during the \nprocess of optimisation of th e current layer state. The \ngoal and the result of the method are to get the \nminimum transport output: \n \n11 minmm\nck j k j kjfb s ===× →∑∑  (1) \nThe least possible value of fc means that the \nelements in the system are placed in a way which \nensures optimum flow of the material [14]. The starting \nhypothesis of Schmigalla method is that the minimum \ntransport output will be achieved if the elements with \nthe largest intensity of material flow are set next to each \nother in the triangular mesh. If there are more than one \nsuch pair, the one having the highest number of \nconnections with the other obj ect is selected. If there is \nstill more than one such pair of objects, then a random \npair is selected and placed in the neighbourhood vertices \nof the central equilateral triangle of the mesh. Next, the \nsum of the intensity of connections between dislocated \nand not dislocated objects is determined. Between non \ndislocated objects, the one having the highest intensity \nof connections with the dislocated object is selected and \nplaced next to the first pair in the mesh. If it turns out \nthere is more than one obj ect with the same highest \nnumber of connections with the dislocated object, a \nrandom one is selected. After the selection of the \nsubsequent object is located, its potential position in the \ntriangular network is determined [15]. \nThere are a few main disadvantages in the modified \ntriangle method. Although the procedure of calculating, \nselecting and placing elements in equilateral triangle \nmesh is relatively simple for low numbers of elements, \nit becomes much more complex and time-consuming if \nthere are more than ten el ements in the system. The \nsecond problem is the fact th at the degrees of material \nflow, and sums between elements which are not jet \nplaced and the pairs of alread y placed elements, start to \nrepeat themselves. When selecting a new element for \nplacing in the triangular mesh, several possibilities can \nemerge. This means there ar e more options for building \na layout. There can be more than one candidate to be \nselected next or/and there are several possibilities \nregarding already emerged pairs where new candidate \ncan be placed. Depending on the complexity of the \nmodel and connectivity between the elements, finding \nthe optimal solution can be extremely difficult to solve. \nNowadays there are many generic algorithms for \nsolving the facility layout problems such as one \npresented in [16]. \nIn this case, a study of th e analysis of the existing \nlayout system is given to check the suitability of the \ncurrent arrangement in relation to the ideal. In addition \nto analysing the current situation, the proposals of the \nnew optimal layout system is given according to the \nresults obtained by the modified triangle method.  \nThe starting point of the analysis is the calculation of \nthe material flow intensity matrix. The calculation of the \nflow is based on the data of production program, \ndevelopment plans and assembly plans. Also the \ndescription of manufacturing program is given by the \ncompany, so the calculation is given by analyzing the \nfourteen representative products (divided into three groups: \ndry transformers and two groups of special transformers). \nThe calculation is made by following these steps [14]: \n• The product is divided into smaller sections \n(assemblies and parts), \n• Number of parts and assemblies are defined for \nplanning period (eg. month, year etc.), \n• Material handling equipment for each component is \ndefined.  \n• For each component the necessary number of \ntransport is calculated. Number of transports for one \nseries of one component is calculated by this formula: \n \n1si\nOli\nPOi TSi\nQn QQ=×  (2) \n• The material flow intensity, expressed in the number \nof transports between k-th and j-th element of the \nsystem in the planning period is calculated (number of \ntransports multiplicities the number of series). \n• Total transport intensity in the planning period \nbetween k-th and j-th element of the system is \nobtained by summing the transport intensity for all the \ncomponents which are transported between the \nelements of the system. \n288 ▪ VOL. 46, No 2, 2018 FME Transactions\n \n \n \nFigure 4. The material flow intensity matrix for default process [17] \nFollowing the completion of the calculation, the \nmaterial flow intensity matrix is made. The values \ninside the matrix represent the transport intensity \nbetween the k-th and j-th element of the system. As each \nelement of the system can be a source or a target point, \nthe matrix is square. The material flow intensity matrix \nfor default process is shown in Figure 4. \nBased on the data given from the material flow \nintensity matrix, the mesh of the equilateral triangles is \ncreated. First two elements wh ich are assigned in trian–\ngular mesh are the ones with the highest material flow \nbetween them; in this case they are assembling of the \nactive part and control. Next elements assigned in the \ntriangular mesh are defined by following the rules men–\ntioned before in the text. Elements within the triangular \nmesh are labeled by numbers shown in the Figure 3. \n(e.g. Workstation 1 is 1, Control is 9 etc.). The trian–\ngular mesh of the default system is shown in Figure 5. \n \nFigure 5. Mesh of equilateral triangles [17] \nBased on the layout of the elements given in the \ntriangular mesh, the minimum transport output for \noptimal layout is calculated: \n \n11 638mm\nck j k j kjfb s ===× =∑∑  (3) \nTransport output based on the current layout is also \ncalculated and that value is 897 distance units/planning \nperiod, so it is evident that the current layout can be \noptimised. Based on the amount of the manufactured \nproducts, the planning period used in this case study is one \nyear. In this case study only the optimization of location \nwas used based on existing limitations. Taking into account \nsome management limitations that some elements of the \nsystem must remain in the current positions (in this case \nthose elements are the control station and both dryers) the \nnew layout is proposed and shown in Figure 6. Also work–\nstation 2 and workstation 3 are similar by their charac–\nteristics, so workstation 3 can be excluded from the system \nbecause considering the current amount of the products, it \nis not necessary to use both workstations. Eliminating \nworkstations 3 from the system and the redistribution of \nthe elements would enable extra space for storage of semi-\nfinished and finished products (the area with hatch in \nFigure 6). Therefore, taking into account the listed limi–\ntations, the new minimum transport output is calculated \nand that value is 787 distance units/planning period.  \nThe actual value of transport output is calculated by \nentering the actual distance between the elements (instead of \na unit distance in the triangular method). The value of the \ntransport output for the current state is 12554 m/planning \nperiod and the value of the transport output for the optimal \nlayout (taking into account given limitations) is 9787 \nm/planning period. The results are shown in Table 1. \nBy redistributing of elements, the obtained savings \nwould be 2767 m/planning period for the current \namount of products. If the assumption is that the \naverage transport speed is 5 m/ min, it is calculated that \nsaving time for transport is 9,2 hours/planning period, \nand also by eliminating the Workstation 2 and \nredistribution of the elements, a certain space is given \n(in this case 42 m\n2) which can be used for storage or \nsomething else. \n \nFME Transactions VOL. 46, No 2, 2018 ▪ 289\n \n \n \nFigure 6.

CONCLUSION  \n \nThis paper is a case study of the plant optimization in the \nproduction of special transformers. The goal of the \noptimization is to make ch eaper and faster delivered \nproducts. Investing in new equipment is not always the \nbest solution because it is costly and most companies buy \nnew equipment and machines and install them where they \nhave free space, not taking into account the material flow \noptimization. This can result in unnecessary transport \ncost rise. In many cases companies have reserves that can \nbe exploited. One way to find these reserves is by using \nthe material flow optimization with adequate dislocation \nof the working stands participating in the internal \ntransport by Bloch-Schmigalla method. The analysis of \nthe internal transport of the company has shown the \npotential of the optimization in respect of the material \nflow and the minimization of the cost involved in it. \nAlthough the analysis by Bloch-Schmigalla method has \nshown there could be improvements, they are minor \nconsidering the current amount of products assembled in \nthe default production hall. But on the other side, it is \nimportant for the company to check the difference \nbetween the current layout and the optimal one because if \nthe lead times are shortened and employees spent less \ntime for transport they can do something else during that \ntime. It is management decision if it is profitable to make \nsome changes in the system, taking into account \ncalculated savings and possible costs. But if there will be \na significant increase in the quantity of the product \nredistribution of the system elements into the optimal \nlayout, it should be considered.  \nBy redistributing elements of the system using \nBloch-Schmigalla method, taking into account some \nmanagement limitations that some elements of the \nsystem must remain in the current positions, the \nobtained savings would be 2767 m/planning period \nwhich is a reduction of 22 % compared with the current \nlayout. Also, the utilization of the elements in the \ncurrent layout is approximately 30 %, so there is a space \nfor a significant increase in the quantity of the products. \nThe optimization of the material flow must be followed \nby a standardization of the transport routes, manufac–\nturing process, etc., in order to achieve further optimi–\nzation of the production and shorter lead times. \nWith the obtained savings in transport times, the \nenergy consumption of the material handling equipment \nis reduced, which leads to increased sustainability \nwithin the transport system.  \nAs part of the future work it will be beneficial to \nuse methods (e.g. Value Stream Mapping) to identify \nwastes in the whole production program. Also usage of \nsimulation programs connected with Industry 4.0 would \nhelp to quickly (in real time) define wastes and other \nproblems in the production and also in the warehouses, \nsuch as presented in papers [18, 19]. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Westkämper, E.: Strategic Development of \nFactories under the Influence of Emergent \nTechnologies, CIRP Annals - Manufacturing \nTechnology, Vol. 56, No. 1, pp. 419-422, 2007. \n[2] AUTOMATICA: Accompanying Program: Smart \nfactory, 6th international Trade Fair for Automation \nand Mechatronics, Munich, 3-6.
