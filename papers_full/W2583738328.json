    "abstract": "Careful monitoring of high voltage equipments and diagnosing the critical conditions before they lead to a disaster are prerequisites of condition‐based maintenance. Moisture content in a transformer is regarded as one of the major factors in diagnosing its conditions. It causes many problems for a power transformer including electrical breakdown between either its windings or one winding with neutral, increase in the amount of partial discharge and sundry minor problems. Since paper insulation of a power transformer carries large portion of water content, determining moisture content in this part of the transformer is essential. However, the problem is that the direct measurement of moisture in paper is impossible. Therefore, various methods have been proposed to measure the moisture content in a transformer but each one has its limitations. In this study, an approach is introduced to measure water content in a transformer by analysing the moisture dynamics in oil, tracking its variations and analysis of parameters such as temperature, without necessity of disconnecting the transformer from the power grid.",
