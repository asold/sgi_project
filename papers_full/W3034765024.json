  "abstract": "In mitigation, one of the sensors used is the sensor to observe the movement of land in anticipating of a landslide that occurs in Indonesia. This research has been developed Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) sensor that is a position sensor to serve as land displacement sensor. The development of LVDT sensor has been developed and has started to be produced in prototype, but the price is expensive, therefore in this research used the material that is affordable so that the price is cheaper. This LVDT sensor has the smallest scale specification is 0.1 mm with a measurement range up to 140 mm. For testing of this sensor by making experimental simulations using a container measuring. The container is tilted to an angle with varying angle of 400, 450 and 500. The results of land displacement experiments at angles of 400, 450 and 500 are 5.5 mm, 27.6 mm and 28.3 mm. This data shows the angle of the ground is directly proportional to the magnitude of landslides.",
