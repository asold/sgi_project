  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in various fields, including labor markets and business cycles. In this paper, we examine the impact potential of LLMs in labor markets and business cycles in China through a qualitative case study. We first provide background information on LLMs and labor markets and business cycles in China, and then review the relevant literature. Next, we describe the methodology of our study, including the data collection process and data analysis techniques. We present the findings of our case study and identify themes and patterns related to the impact potential of LLMs. We then discuss the implications of our findings for the use of LLMs in labor markets and business cycles in China, compare our findings to the literature review, and offer suggestions for future research. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature on LLMs and their impact potential in various fields and provides insights into the potential use of LLMs in labor markets and business cycles in China.",
