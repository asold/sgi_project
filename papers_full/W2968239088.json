  "abstract": "Transformers are the most important links between generation, transmission and distribution of a power system.Their failure can cause huge revenue loss to utilities as there is non-availability of power for long hours.Several factors like high load, overheating and short circuits influence the aging of the insulating system present in transformer.Many diagnostic tests are carried out and remedial actions are taken for ensuring non-interrupted, trouble free power supply to customers.End of useful life of a power transformer is determined by the remaining life of paper insulation in the transformer.The aging in the paper insulation is determined by mechanical strength or tensile strength of the solid insulation and is measured in terms of its Degree of Polymerization (DP).The traditional method for determining DP is called the direct method and it requires actual paper samples therefore making it costly and intrusive.Recently an indirect method is used, which estimates the DP value from the furan compounds dissolved in the oil and this is a non-intrusive process.This paper presents analysis of various indirect methods used in remaining life estimation and also comparative studies have been made among the mathematical equations developed by various researchers correlating 2-furaldehyde and DP with respect to ageing process.",
