    "abstract": "This paper shows experimental results of longitudinal flux density and its harmonics at the limb, the yoke and the corner of a three-phase, Si-Fe, five-legged wound transformer core. Results show that the flux density is nonuniform in the cores and there is high level of third harmonic component. Moreover, the lower flux values in the outer cores have been assessed and the simultaneous time variation of the flux in both outer cores has been demonstrated by measurements while the peak magnetic flux density values have been compared to FEM analysis. These findings enable a better understanding of the magnetic behavior of five-legged wound transformer cores and their consideration is expected to achieve respective improvement of the design with respect to core losses and magnetostriction noise. © 2010 IEEE.",
