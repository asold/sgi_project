  "full_text": "ActaDV ActaDVAdvances in dermatology and venereology Acta Dermato-Venereologica\nEDITORIAL\n1/1\nPublished by Medical Journals Sweden, on behalf of the Society for Publication of Acta Dermato-Venereologica. This is an Open Access article distributed \nunder the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\nThe aim of this editorial is to provide guidance relating to the \nuse of large language models (LLMs), also referred to as conver-\nsational artificial intelligence (CAI), when submitting or peer-\nreviewing papers for Acta Dermato Venereologica (ActaDV).\nThe current unprecedented development of LLMs, fine-tuned \nwith both supervised and reinforcement machine learning (ML), \nhas opened an important discussion about how these tools \nshould be used in academia. It is safe to say that the recent \nprogress is nothing short of a disruption, and it is, without doubt, \none of the greatest leaps in technology since the introduction \nof the Internet. \nMany researchers have already become increasingly familiar \nwith the use of LLMs, including Chat Generative Pre-Trained \nTransformer (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA), \nwhich was released on 30 November 2022 (1). LLMs have been \nwidely disseminated and have, very rapidly become implemen-\nted in our work routines and daily lives. Remarkably, within \nthe last 10 weeks, more than 100 million users have registered \nas users with ChatGPT, setting a record for the fastest-growing \nuser base for any online application (2).\nWorldwide, editorial offices, which may not yet have policies \non the use of LLMs, are currently facing challenging ethics \nquestions regarding the use of these tools and the integrity \nof scientific publishing. Interestingly, Science and Springer \nNature, two highly influential publishing groups, have made \ndivergent decisions about how LLMs may be used in their af-\nfiliated journals. While Science journals has (as of 26 January \n2023) decided to completely prohibit the use of ChatGPT or \nany other AI tools (3), Nature, along with other Springer Nature \njournals, has (as of 24 January 2023) approved their use as long \nas the authors clearly document it in the appropriate section \n(i.e. methods, acknowledgements or introduction) (4). These \ndifferent editorial decisions reflect the challenging nature of \nthis development, which raises important questions regarding \nthe originality of works presented.\nActaDV will adhere to any future guidelines proposed by the \nInternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). \nHowever, before any such guidance is published, we need to \nselect a path that properly aligns with current developments, \nwhile bearing authors’, reviewers’, and our readership’s best \ninterests in mind, combined with our ethical agenda and beliefs.\nFundamentally, we agree that LLMs or any similar ML system \nmust never be listed as a co-author, even if it may appropriately \nhave guided a researcher in the generation and conceptualiza-\ntion of a research idea. However, we question whether banning \nLLMs is the correct direction to take. We currently envisage \nmany opportunities and advantages of allowing the use of LLMs \nonce all research data and results have been compiled. The use \nof online thesaurus, translations functions, talk to text techno-\nlogy and other word editing programs are now an integrated part \nour workflow. Consequently, it seems reasonable to allow LLM \ntools to improve an already generated text in terms of selection \nUse of Large Language Models: Editorial Comments \nSam POLESIE (Deputy Editor)1,2 and Olle LARKÖ (Editor-in-Chief)1\n1Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg and 2Region \nVästra Götaland, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Gothenburg, Sweden.

After all most authors \nsubmitting manuscripts to ActaDV do not have English as their \nfirst language. We believe that use of these tools as a critical \nproof-reader, should be accepted, and we are confident that our \nauthors will find ethically appropriate ways of improving their \nwriting through the use of LLMs. \nIf authors submitting their work to ActaDV opt to use LLMs \nto help in the writing process, it is mandatory to state this in the \nacknowledgements section. However, we would like to remind \nall submitting authors that textbook knowledge, which only \ntakes a few seconds for LLMs to compile, should consistently \nbe avoided. It is essential that a balanced, unbiased, and accurate \nliterature review is always responsibly compiled by the listed \nauthors and must never be left to LLM. Moreover, manuscripts \nsubmitted as reviews that have not strictly adhered to the sys-\ntematic review format (i.e. narrative or scoping reviews) will \nconsistently be rejected. \nAs for invited reviewers, we have applied somewhat different \nrules. Apart from the normal routines and recommendations to \nthe editorial office, reviewers should pay close attention to any \nredundant textbook style information. Fundamentally, due to \npotential data privacy issues, reviewers of ActaDV must never \nuse (i.e. copy and paste) any content from unpublished ma -\nnuscripts provided to them into any LLM. However, reviewers \nmay use LLMs to improve language for the same reasons as \nset out above.\nWe have updated our author and reviewer instructions (avai-\nlable at: https://medicaljournalssweden.se/actadv/authorguide-\nlines and https://medicaljournalssweden.se/actadv/reviewergui-\ndelines) according to the instructions provided above. However, \nsince this is a rapidly developing field, we acknowledge that \nvery few, if any, of us have insights into how the use of LLMs \nwill ultimately be integrated in routine academia. As such, we \nrecognize that several ethics questions, relating to how these \ntools might be used in the future, currently remain unanswered. \nFrom the Editorial perspective, we will pay close attention to \nthis issue, and continue to strive to ensure that the manuscripts \naccepted by our journal are constructed by human endeavour \nand curiosity, while acknowledging that machines can help us in \naugmenting and improving how we communicate our message.\nREFERENCES\n1.
