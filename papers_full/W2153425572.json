Thus, we tested the STRATIFY tool with some modification\nand re-weighting of items in Canadian hospitals.\nMethods: This was a prospective validation cohort study in four acute care medical units of two\nteaching hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario. In total, 620 patients over the age of 65 years admitted\nduring a 6-month period. Five patient characteristics found to be risk factors for falls in the British\nSTRATIFY study were tested for pr edictive validity. The characteri stics included history of falls,\nmental impairment, visual impairment, toilet ing, and dependency in transfers and mobility.\nMultivariate logistic regression was used to obta in optimal weights for th e construction of a risk\nscore. A receiver-operating ch aracteristic curve was generate d to show sensitivities and\nspecificities for predicting falls based on different threshold scores for considering patients at high\nrisk.\nResults: Inter-rater reliability for the weighted risk score indicated very good agreement (inter-\nclass correlation coefficien t = 0.78). History of falls, mental im pairment, toileting difficulties, and\ndependency in transfer / mobility significantly predicted fallers. In  the multivariate model, mental\nstatus was a significant predictor (P < 0.001) while history of falls and transfer / mobility difficulties\napproached significance (P = 0.089 and P = 0.077 respectively). The logistic  regression model led\nto weights for a risk score on a 30-point scale. A risk score of 9 or more gave a sensitivity of 91%\nand specificity of 60% for predicting who would fall.\nConclusion: Good predictive validity for identifying fallers was achieved in a Canadian setting using\na simple-to-obtain risk score that can easily be incorporated into practice.\nPublished: 21 January 2004\nBMC Medicine 2004, 2:1\nReceived: 13 August 2003\nAccepted: 21 January 2004\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/2/1\n© 2004 Papaioannou et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Risk of hip fracture was found to be 11 times greater\nin hospital patients compared to those in the community\n[2]. Patient characteristics implicated in falls that occur in\nhospitals include history of falls, difficulty in transfers or\nambulating, dizziness and balance, delirium, visual\nimpairment, medications, incontinence and toileting fre-\nquency [3-5].\nClinical prediction rules are tools designed to predict\nhealth outcomes and assist health care professionals plan\npatient care. These tools typically include three or more\nrisk factors from a patient's history or physical exam that\npredict an outcome such as falls [6]. The STRATIFY tool\nwas developed and validated in the United Kingdom to\npredict falls occurring in hospital. The tool contains five\nclinical factors associated with falling (e.g. previous falls,\nmental impairment) with a simple scoring system. The\ntool incorporates many of the features that instrument\ndevelopers desire including 1) predictive validity: high\nsensitivity and specificity for predicting falls, 2) feasibility;\nthe items are easily and rapidly assessed by nursing staff\nwith minimal staff training required, and 3) reproducibil-\nity; the predictive variables and the decision rule were\ntested in different geriatric settings [7].\nHowever the STRATIFY tool has limitations. Altman [8,9]\npointed out that falls, rather than patients, were outcomes\nin the STRATIFY study, which could inflate predictive\nvalidity. Specifically, of 217 patients, 71 falls occurred\n(approximately a 30% rate of falls) [6]. Prediction might\nalso have been weakened by the absence of item weight-\ning as certain patient characteristics may have greater\nvalue in predicting falls. Price [10] emphasized that the\nuse of data on falls in hospital to update risk scores in the\nSTRATIFY study, would inflate the calculated predictive\nvalidity and decrease useful prediction. In fact, the major-\nity of falls occur in the first week of hospitalization\n[11,12]. Finally, the use of items in the tool having varying\ninterpretations (e.g. agitation) may compromise repro-\nducibility. Ideally, each question in a clinical tool should\nbe interpreted in the same way.\nWe tested the predictive validity of the STRATIFY variables\nin a Canadian setting, with the objective of determining if\nit predicts fallers rather than patient falls. We constructed\na weighted risk score based on the components of the\nSTRATIFY tool and examined its predictive validity.\nMethods\nSetting and participants\nData were collected over a 6-month period in 2000 at\nHamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, a\nmulti-site teaching hospital. Patients over 65 years of age\nadmitted consecutively to four general medical units hav-\ning a total of 114 beds were assessed. Palliative and critical\ncare patients were excluded.\nDefinition of clinical outcome\nThe clinical outcome we studied was \"fallers\" versus \"non-\nfallers\". \"Fallers\" were those having one or more falls dur-\ning hospitalization. A fall was defined as an individual\ninvoluntarily coming to rest on the ground or surface\nlower than their original station [13]. The attending nurse\ndocumented each fall on an incident report and in the\npatient chart. Nurses completing the risk assessment tool\nwere blinded to the rationale for assessing predictor vari-\nables. Incident reports noted time of fall, location, injury\nsustained, type of fall, and potential causative factors.\nOnly falls occurring after screening were included as an\noutcome.\nPredictive variables: identification and definition\nFive patient characteristics found to be risk factors for falls\nin the British STRATIFY study [7] were assessed. Items\nwere modified for the Canadian health care system to\ninclude the definitions of the risk factor to potentially\nincrease reproducibility (Table 1 [see Additional file 1]).\nMental status was divided into three concepts, \"disorien-\ntation\", \"confusion\", and \"agitation\" and definitions were\nadded. Similarly, \"vision impairment\" was assessed based\non four questions and \"history of falls\" was divided into\ntwo questions. Toileting assessment remained one item as\nin STRATIFY but the wording was altered and a definition\nwas added. As in the original tool the \"transfer and mobil-\nity\" measure was taken from the Barthel Index [14] and\nwas the sum for transfer (0 to 3) and mobility (0 to 3)\nscores for a total ranging from of 0 (dependent) to 6\n(independent).\nScreening assessment scoring\nThe nurses completing the screening tool had a 10-min\norientation session run by the clinical nurse specialists\nwho were part of the investigative team. The assigned\nnurse collected screening variables 24 to 48 hours after the\npatient was admitted to hospital in a 5-min bedside\nsession.\nTo calculate predictive validity, each of the five items were\nscored dichotomously as 1 = present, and 0 = absent for\nitems 1 to 4. The risk factors were deemed to be \"present\"\nif one or more of the statements were considered within\neach domain (Table 1 [see Additional file 1]). For exam-\nple, mental impairment was present if one or more of con-\nfusion, disorientation or agitation were scored \"yes\". If\nnone of these variables were present, then the risk factor\nwas scored as \"absent\". Scores of 0 to 3 for the transfer and\nmobility sub-score corresponded to the presence of the\nBMC Medicine 2004, 2 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/2/1\nPage 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nrisk factor and scores of 4 to 6 were considered to repre-\nsent absence of the risk factor.\nStatistical analyses\nEach of the five items was assessed individually and col-\nlectively for their predictive power based on logistic\nregression models. The variables were also used to pro-\nduce an overall risk score using two approaches. First, an\nunweighted risk score (r) was computed by simply count-\ning the number of risk factors present. This gave a risk\nscore ranging from 0 to 5, as in the original STRATIFY\nstudy.\nSecond, a weighted risk score was obtained based on the\nregression coefficients from the multivariate logistic\nregression model in which the outcome was the fall status\nof the patient. Specifically, the relative magnitude of the\nbeta coefficients from the multivariate logistic model\nreflects the relative prognostic strength of the risk factors\nwhen they are jointly considered. Therefore the relevant\ninformation for the construction of the weights is the rel-\native size of the beta coefficients and any weights, which\npreserve these ratios, will preserve good predictive validity\n(see Appendix [Additional File 1] for further details).\nTo consider predictive validity in terms of sensitivity and\nspecificity one must consider two populations, \"fallers\"\nand \"non-fallers\". Two receiver operating characteristic\ncurves (ROC) were constructed to display the varying spe-\ncificity and sensitivity values applicable to the range of\npossible thresholds of unweighted (0 – 5) and weighted\nrisk (0 – 30) scores that could be used to classify patients\nas high risk for falling or not. All analyses were performed\nusing the Statistical Analysis System (SAS release 8.1).\nInter-rater reliability\nTwo nurses independently assessed a sub-sample of 35\npatients. The order of assessments was random and asses-\nsors were blind to the findings of the other nurse. The\nrequired sample size was estimated at 33 patients, with\npower = 0.80 and alpha = 0.05 using published power\ntables [15]. The inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC)\nwas computed for the weighted and un-weighted risk\nscores. The kappa statistic was computed on reliability of\nclassification into \"high\" versus \"normal\" risk based on\nthe optimal threshold score.\nResults\nOver 6 months, 620 patients were screened for falls. The\nmean age was 78 years (SD 7.7) and 338 (54.5%) patients\nwere female. The diagnoses most responsible for hospital-\nization in the sample were circulatory disorders (45.2%),\nrespiratory disorders (20.8%), digestive disorders (4.0%)\nand mental disorders (2.9%). Diagnosis was not predic-\ntive of falls. Thirty-four patients (5.5%) fell at least once\nduring their hospitalization and there were a total of 77\nfalls. In total, 171 patients (27.6%) had a history of falls\nat admission.\nPredictive variables\nBased on univariate logistic regression (Table 1) history of\nfalls prior to admission (P = 0.011), mental status (con-\nfused, disoriented or agitated) (P < 0.001), toileting diffi-\nculties (P = 0.005) and transfer / mobility difficulties (P <\n0.001) predicted falls. When the inter-correlations\nbetween these independent variables were controlled for\nusing multiple logistic regression (Table 1), only mental\nstatus (P < 0.001) remained a significant predictor. In\nterms of the magnitude of the associations from this mul-\ntivariate model the odds of falling increased over four fold\nin individuals with mental impairment (odds ratio (OR)\n= 4.06; 95% CI: 1.81,9.16). History of falls and transfer/\nmobility difficulties incurred an approximate two-fold\nincrease in risk while approaching significance (P = 0.089\nand P = 0.077 respectively).\nWhen length of stay was added to the multivariate model,\nthe odds ratios associated with each risk factor were\nslightly attenuated. However, the pattern of results\nremained the same and mental status was most predictive,\nfollowed by history of falls, and then transfer/mobility\ndifficulties.\nTable 1: Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from the univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.\nItem Univariate Analysis Multivariate Analysis\nOR 95% CI P-value OR 95% CI P-value\nHistory of falls 2.47 (1.23,4.96) 0.011 1.88 (0.91,3.89) 0.089\nMental Status 6.07 (2.86,12.86) <0.001 4.06 (1.81,9.16) <0.001\nVision Impaired 1.02 (0.51, 2.05) 0.946 1.09 (0.53,2.24) 0.824\nToilet Difficulty 2.79 (1.37,5.67) 0.005 1.20 (0.52,2.75) 0.669\nTransfer / Mobility 3.71 (1.83,7.50) <0.001 2.10 (0.92,4.78) 0.077\nBMC Medicine 2004, 2 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/2/1\nPage 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nA weighted risk formula (Appendix I) was derived which\nshows the relative magnitude of the regression coefficients\nfrom the multivariate logistic regression model. This for-\nmula can easily be used to calculate the weighted risk\nscore.\nROC curves\nThe ROC curves based on the unweighted and weighted\nrisk scores are given in Figure 1 and sensitivities and spe-\ncificities are displayed for a subset of possible threshold\nvalues in Table 2. As the weighted risk score (R) is\nincreased from 0, the sensitivity falls very little until one\nreaches a false positive rate of about 0.40, which corre-\nsponds to R = 9. Balancing sensitivity and specificity, we\nselected this as the ideal cut-off score, which results in a\nsensitivity of 91.2% (95% CI: 81.6, 100.7) and specificity\nof 60.2% (95% CI: 56.3, 64.2). With a threshold of 9, the\ntool would correctly classify over 90% of those patients at\nhigh risk for falling and over 60% of those at normal risk.\nWhen the cut-off score increases to 20, specificity\nincreases slightly (78.8%), however, sensitivity signifi-\ncantly falls (55.9%).\nThe ROC curve for the un-weighted risk score (r) (Figure\n1) had poorer predictive validity. For example, when two\nor more risk factors are present (r ≤ 2), sensitivity was\n91.2%, but specificity was only 49.3%. Increasing r to 3 or\nmore risk factors resulted in an increase in specificity to\n71.3% but sensitivity dropped to an unacceptable 61.8%.\nReceiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for weighted (0 – 30) and unweighted (0 – 5) risk scoreFigure 1\nReceiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for weighted (0 – 30) and unweighted (0 – 5) risk score\n\nBMC Medicine 2004, 2 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/2/1\nPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nInter-rater reliability\nThe inter-rater reliability between the two nurses using the\nweighted risk score gave an ICC of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.60,\n0.88). The reliability of the binary classification of high /\nnormal risk gave kappa = 0.63 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.90). The\nunweighted risk score gave a similar reliability (ICC =\n0.68; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.83).\nDiscussion\nFalls in the elderly are often a symptom of acute medical\nproblems in combination with underlying risks such as\nmedications, postural hypotension and lower extremity\nweakness. Identifying those at risk allows targeted assess-\nment and intervention such as a review of medications\nand environmental modifications [16]. This study dem-\nonstrated good predictive validity for the modified SRAT-\nIFY tool to identify individuals at risk of falling in acute\ncare. With a risk score of 9, sensitivity was 91% and specif-\nicity was 60%. The falls risk assessment tool can be easily\nincorporated into practice without added burden to the\npatient. The findings were achieved with a conservative\nmethodology in which the outcome measure was the\npatient (i.e. fallers), rather than falls, and the risk score\nwas generated before any falls. Despite minimal nurse\ntraining and short completion time, we were able to\nobtain very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.78). A\nrecent analytic review of falls risk assessment tools found\nthat only two of five tools used in acute care with a sensi-\ntivity over 80 described how long the tool took to com-\nplete and only one had findings reproduced by other\ninvestigators. Many did not report inter-rater reliability\n[17].\nRisk factors included in screening for falls in hospitalized\npatients have largely been consistent across studies with\nvarying methods. Findings have repeatedly emphasized\nfalls history, mental impairment, toileting frequency, and\ngeneral mobility as predictive variables for falls [7,18-23].\nNevertheless, it is not yet clear how to maximize predic-\ntion. The variables included in different studies do not\noverlap entirely and some studies incorporate variables\nwith poor or inconsistent predictive validity. For example,\nvisual impairment had poor predictive value in our study\nand no significant predictive value in Morse's study [24].\nOliver et al. included visual impairment as a variable in\nSTRATIFY based on an initial study phase in which it was\nmoderately predictive (OR = 3.55), and appeared to rank\nfifth strongest among 10 clinical variables described [7].\nHowever, their design did not include a control for inter-\ncorrelations among risk factors. Also, relevant to optimiz-\ning prediction is the fact that Morse's study [24] and ours\nare the only ones to include weightings derived from\nquantitative analysis. Item weighting was clearly impor-\ntant to optimize prediction.\nTable 2: Sensitivities and specificities for threshold of weighted risk score (0 – 30)\nRisk Score False Positive Rate False  Negative Rate Sensitivity Specificity\n0 100.0 0.0 100.0 (100.0,100.0) 0.0 (0.0, 0.0)\n1 81.7 2.9 97.1 (91.4,102.7) 18.3 (15.1,21.4)\n2 61.3 5.9 94.1 (86.2,102.0) 38.7 (34.8,42.7)\n3 59.0 5.9 94.1 (86.2,102.0) 41.0 (37.0,44.9)\n6 52.9 8.8 91.2 (81.6,100.7) 47.1 (43.1,51.1)\n7 50.5 8.8 91.2 (81.6,100.7) 49.5 (45.4,53.5)\n8 43.0 8.8 91.2 (81.6,100.7) 57.0 (53.0,61.0)\n9 39.8 8.8 91.2 (81.6,100.7) 60.2 (56.3,64.2)\n10 34.1 14.7 85.3 (73.4, 97.2) 65.9 (62.0,69.7)\n13 32.3 20.6 79.4 (65.8, 93.0) 67.7 (64.0,71.5)\n14 31.4 23.5 76.5 (62.2, 90.7) 68.6 (64.8,72.4)\n15 27.5 29.4 70.6 (55.3, 85.9) 72.5 (68.9,76.1)\n16 24.7 32.4 67.6 (51.9, 83.4) 75.3 (71.8,78.7)\n17 22.7 38.2 61.8 (45.4, 78.1) 77.3 (73.9,80.7)\n20 21.2 44.1 55.9 (39.2, 72.6) 78.8 (75.5,82.1)\n21 19.6 52.9 47.1 (30.3, 63.8) 80.4 (77.2,83.6)\n22 17.1 61.8 38.2 (21.9, 54.6) 82.9 (79.9,86.0)\n23 15.2 67.6 32.4 (16.6, 48.1) 84.8 (81.9,87.7)\n24 8.2 73.5 26.5 (11.6, 41.3) 91.8 (89.6,94.0)\n27 4.6 79.4 20.6 (7.0, 34.2) 95.4 (93.7,97.1)\n28 4.1 79.4 20.6 (7.0, 34.2) 95.9 (94.3,97.5)\n29 3.8 79.4 20.6 (7.0, 34.2) 96.2 (94.7,97.8)\n30 2.2 85.3 14.7 (2.8, 26.6) 97.8 (96.6,99.0)\nBMC Medicine 2004, 2 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/2/1\nPage 6 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nStudies have also differed in the suggested ideal risk score\ncut-offs to consider patients in the \"at risk\" group.\nWhether our suggested cut-off of 9 is ideal for different\nhospital settings is not known. One approach is to use the\ncut-off that maximizes predictive power mathematically.\nPractitioners in different settings may adjust the trade-off\nbetween sensitivity and specificity, based on differing falls\nrates, values, laws, funding and other factors.\nOur finding of poor predictive validity with the\nunweighted items does not clearly amount to poor gener-\nalization across settings because the items and protocol\nwere changed. Studies involving tests of prediction tools\nin new locations have found results that are weaker than\nthe original findings [25]. The difficulty obtaining gener-\nalized (i.e. reproducible) effects is concerning. One expla-\nnation may be that the base rate for occurrence of a\nclinical outcome is known to affect positive predictive\nvalue [24,25]. Our base rate for falls was 5.5%, which is\nlower than that found in the British study and may have\ncontributed to lower predictability. Another possibility is\nthat prediction may only be consistent among patients\nwith similar characteristics, resulting in generalization\nacross some settings and not others.\nA potential methodological limitation is uncertainty\nabout patient incident reports, which may not capture all\nfalls, however our documented rate of falls was similar to\nprevious years in our setting. There is also the possibility\nthat completing risk assessments influences how nurses\nrespond to patients in terms of falls prevention strategies\n(i.e. Hawthorne effect). It is unknown if this factor\naffected the true rate of falls in our setting. However, it is\npredicted that this effect is likely minimal given that\nstrong consistent falls prevention strategies were not in\nplace at the time of the study. Another potential limitation\nis that despite some changes to scale items taken from\nSTRATIFY to improve reproducibility; there is still room\nfor error. For example, patient recall of falls may not be\naccurate and consistent. This may have accounted for an\ninter-rater reliability that was lower than ideal. The prob-\nlem stresses a potential need to improve operational defi-\nnitions of risk variables to ensure reproducibility in\nmeasuring items such as mental status. It may help to\nhave consensus among investigators on key issues includ-\ning: which variables to include, operational definitions of\nrisk constructs, the duration over which risk is assessed\n(i.e. within 24 or 48 hours), the way in which users should\nbe trained, and what the appropriate outcomes are (e.g.\nfalls versus fallers). Further replication of our study in\nother settings will help to correct upon these limitations\nand improve generalizability.\nConclusions\nWe found good predictive validity for identifying fallers in\nhospital in a Canadian setting after weighting risk factors.\nAssessment of fall risk is one of the essential quality indi-\ncators for care of the older adult.\nCompeting Interests\nNone declared.\nAuthors' contributions\nAP, WP, JA and EC were involved with study design.
