    "abstract": "2 Abstract: Medicinal herbs are an important source of phytochemicals that offer traditional medicinal treatment of various ailments. In Kisii region, southwest Kenya. Urtica dioica is amongst the herbs used as phytomedicine for the treatment of diabetes, malaria and pneumonia. A study was carried out on the plant in the year 2011 to 2012. The objective of the study was to identify the functional groups present in Urtica dioica by using Fourier transformer infra-red (FTIR) Spectrophotometer method of analysis. Results of the FTIR Spectra of the hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and ethanol crude extracts revealed the presence of different functional groups as follows: OH stretching for hydroxyl (3618.2-3359.8 cm ), C=O stretching for 1",
