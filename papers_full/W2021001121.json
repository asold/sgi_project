    "abstract": "We present ongoing work in a scalable, distributed implementation of over 200 million individual language models, each capturing a single user's dialect in a given language (multilingual users have several models). These have a variety of practical applications, ranging from spam detection to speech recognition, and dialectometrical methods on the social graph. Users should be able to view any content in their language (even if it is spoken by a small population), and to browse our site with appropriately translated interface (automatically generated, for locales with little crowd-sourced community effort).",
