Simulation results are validated through experimental \nmeasurements. Results of this paper are  also compared with the results obtained for other types of transformer winding \ndeformations that are published in the literature in order to identify unique impact for each fault type on the proposed \nmethod.

Introduction \nCondition monitoring and diagnosis techniques have \nbecome essential to maintain the reliability of various assets \nwithin electrical power transmission and distribution \nnetworks. As power transformer represents a key asset in \nsuch networks, it has been given much attention through \nregular monitoring of its health condition to detect any \nincipient faults as early as possible [ 1-3]. In case of minor \nmechanical winding deformation that may occur as a result \nof short circuit faults, transformer may continue work \nnormally however; transformer mechanical integrity is \nsignificantly deteriorated [3]. Among the several techniques \ncurrently used to evaluate the condition of the transformer, \nfrequency response analysis (FRA) has been considered as \nthe most reliable tool to detect transformer mechanical \nintegrity [4]. Owing to the fact that power transformer can \nbe modelled as electrical e quivalent circuit comprising \ncapacitive and inductive elements, magnitudes of these \nelectrical circuit parameters are changing as a result of any \nphysical deformation within the transformer windings and \nhence changing the transformer frequency response \ncharacteristic that can be measured using frequency \nresponse analyser. This device  injects a low voltage of \nvariable frequency to each phase of the off -service \ntransformer and measures the response signal at the other \nterminal of the same phase [ 3, 5]. While measurement \nmethod is well developed and standardized, analysis of the \nmeasured FRA signature is not a straight forward process \nand requires high level of professional expertise. As a result, \ndifferent conclusions may be reported for the same FRA \nsignature. Several papers investigating the impacts of \nvarious winding deformations on the transformer FRA \nsignature can be found in the literatures [ 5-7]. However, \nsimilar to current industry practice, most of the published \nstudies have only focused on the magnitude of the measured \nFRA signature without considering the phase angle plot. A \nfew studies in the literature introduced some statistical \nindices such as standard deviation (SD), coefficient of \ncorrelation (CC), and absolute sum of logarithmic error \n(ASLE) th at can be calculated using the numerical values \n(raw data) of the FRA magnitude signature to ease the \ninterpretation process [ 8, 9]. However, these statistical \nparameters were reported to be inadequate tools for \nquantifying and identifying the investigated  signatures [9]. \nThe SD index is dominated by the data scattered around the \nhigh magnitudes of the FRA signature which may lead to a \nwrong conclusion [ 10, 1 1]. The CC fails to calculate the \ncorrect correlation between two signatures under certain \ncircumstances [1 2]. On the other hand, the ASLE was \nreported as an immature indicator that needs further \ninvestigations [1 3]. Recently, an attempt to utilize FRA \npolar plot along with digital image processing (DIP) \ntechniques in order to standardize and automate th e FRA \ninterpretation process was introduced [1 4-16]. While the \nfeasibility of this new approach was investigated to detect \nwinding shorted turns [1 4], axial displacement  and disk \nspace variation  [15], bushing faults and insulating oil \ndeterioration [1 6], i t has not been investigated to detect \nradial faults yet. As such, the main contribution of this paper \nis:  \n-investigating the feasibility of utilizing FRA polar plot \nsignature along with DIP techniques to detect minor levels \nof transformer winding radial deformations.  \n-providing a detailed comparison of the results obtained for \nvarious types of winding deformat ions to identify unique \nthreshold levels for each fault type and level.  \n   In this context, two power transformer models of different \nratings, winding structures and sizes are simulated using 3D \nfinite element analysis and minor levels of windings radial \ndeformations at different locations are implemented to \ninvestigate their impacts on the proposed polar plot. \n2 \n \nMoreover, practical measurements have been conducted on \na single-phase transformer to validate simulation results. \n \n \nFig. 1. 3D transformer models: (a) 10kVA and (b) 40MVA \n \n \nFig. 2. Dimensions (in mm): (a) 10kVA and, (b) 40MVA \n \n \nFig. 3.   10kVA transformer reference FRA signature (a) \nmagnitude, (b) angle and (c) polar plot \n2. Finite element analysis \nFinite element analysis (FEA) is a computer -based \ntechnique that is widely used to emulate the performance of \nreal systems [1 7]. It can effectively analyse the magnetic \nand electric fields within power transformers under different \noperating conditions [1 8]. Three-dimensional (3D) models \nof two power transformers rated at 10kVA and 40MVA as \nshown in Fig. 1 are simulated using FEA based on their \nphysical dimensions (Fig. 2) . The low voltage (LV) \nwindings within the 10kVA transformer are made of a \ncontinuous layer comprising 140 turns in each phase while \nthe high voltage (HV) windings consist of six disks with \n1134 turns. On the other hand, the windings of the 40MVA \ntransformer are of circular configuration in which the \ncontinuous layer of the LV winding compri sing 200 turns \nand the HV winding is made of 10 disks with 120 turns per \ndisk. The detailed specifications of the two transformers can \nbe found in [1 4-16]. The parameters of the transformer \nequivalent electric circuit are calculated using Ansoft \nMaxwell application as explained in [19, 20]. \n3. Proposed polar plot signature   \nFEA technique is used to plot the FRA signature of \neach phase of the LV and HV windings within the 10kVA \nand 40MVA transformers. The FRA signature is obtained \nthrough injecting a sweep fre quency, 10 volts AC voltage \n(𝑉𝑖𝑛) to each phase and measuring the response signal (𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 ) \nat the other terminal of the same  phase. The measured \nhealthy (reference) FRA signature is then plotted as \nmagnitude and phase angle of the transfer function \n(TF= 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 / 𝑉𝑖𝑛 in DB ). Fig. 3 (a) and (b)  show the \nconventional reference FRA signature of the 10kVA \ntransformer. The FRA signa ture of the 40MVA transformer \nis similar to Fig. 3 with different magnitudes and resonance \nfrequencies. Any variation in the FRA signature when \ncompared with the reference signature is an indication for a \nfault. While FRA signature comprises magnitude and phase \nangle plots, only magnitude plot is conventionally used to \ndiagnose transformer winding deformation. This affects the \ndetection accuracy of the current FRA industry practice  \nespecially its ability to detect incipient mechanical faults. \nMoreover, as the current analysis technique relies on visual \ninspection along with some statistical coefficients as \nillustrated in the previous section, the conclusion for the \nsame FRA signature is not always unique and different \nresults may be reported by various exper ts. To enhance the \nFRA accuracy and automate the analysis process, the \nmagnitude and phase angle plots are integrated in one polar \nplot as shown in Fig. 3  (c). In this plot, each scattered point \ninvolves 3 information: magnitude 𝓻, phase angle θ at a \nparticular frequency f and hence it comprises more image \nfeatures than the magnitude plot [14-16]. \n4. Digital image processing techniques \nDIP techniques are computerized and electronic \nalgorithms utilized to improve and automate the \ninterpretation of pictorial information [2 1]. A digital image \nD can be considered as a two -dimensional matrix of pixels. \nEach pixel located at ( i, j) in x-y plan is represented by an \nimage intensity |d| [22]. A digital image processing code has \nbeen developed to extract some unique features from the  \npolar plot image  such as geometrical dimensions, invariant \n(a) \n(b) \n(a) (b) \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n3 \n \nmoments and texture analysis [2 2, 23]. The developed DIP \ncode is illustrated in the flow chart of Fig. 4. The technique \nstarts by acquiring the FRA polar plot signature from the \nfrequency response analyser. The polar plot signature is then \npre-processed to adjust the dimension, colour format  and \nextension type after which it will be manipulated through \nsegmentation process to identify signature boundaries and \nisolate noises . Geometric, invariant moments and texture \nfeatures are then extracted from the processed image [2 4]. \nThese features are utilized to calculate three classification \nparameters: city-block distance (CBD), root mean square \n(RMS) and image Euclidean distance (IED) [25-27], that are \ncompared with the respective values of the reference \nsignature for fault identification and quanti fication. The \ndetails of extracted features along with the three \nclassification parameters can be found in [1 4-16] and hence \nthey are not discussed here. \n \nFig. 4.

These features are \nto be stored for future comparison with future image \nfeatures of the same transformer. The extracted geometric \nfeatures (Table 1) indicate that the LV windings features are \nless than that of the HV windings. On the other hand, Table \n2 shows the invariant moments and texture features of the \nLV windings are higher than that of the HV windings.  \n5. Radial winding deformation detection  \nThe interaction of short circuit currents and magnetic \nflux can result in electromagnetic forces that may cause \nradial deformation to the transformer windings [ 3]. Due to \nthese forces, the HV windings will be subjected to free \nradial buckling (pushed outward to the tank) whereas the \ninner winding will be subjected to compressive stress \n(forced radial buckling) that pushes the winding toward the \ncore [ 20]. Consequently, f orced radial buckling bends the \nLV windings in an alternative span while free buckling \ncauses swell at one or more edge of the conductor. FEA is \nused to simulate such deformations on the two investigated \ntransformers as shown in Fig. 5.  \n \n \nFig. 5.

The impact of these fault \nlevels on conven tional FRA signature (magnitude of the \nwinding transfer function) is shown in Fig. 6(a). Results \nshow that, except for the 40% fault level, all other minor \nfault levels are hard to detect using conventional FRA \nsignature which is considered as one of the w eaknesses of \nthe conventional FRA interpretation approach. Transformer \nincipient mechanical faults should be identified as early as it \nemerges due to the progressive nature of such faults to avoid \nany potential catastrophic consequences. \n(a) (b) \n(c) (d) \n4 \n \n \nFig. 6. Impact of LV winding forced radial buckling fault on: \n(a) conventional approach and (b) polar plot approach \n    To overcome this substantial drawback in the \nconventional FRA signature, polar plots for all investigated \nforced radial buckling levels are obtained as shown in Fig. 6 \n(b). As mentioned above, the polar plot comprises more \nimage features than the magnitude plot and facilitates the \nutilization of DIP techniques, which aids in standardizing \nand automating the FRA interpretation process. The \ndeveloped DIP code is utilized to extract the proposed 15 \nimage features from the polar plot  images as listed in Table \n3. Similar to the method in [13 -15], geometric features are \nused to calculate the CBD metric (Fig. 7(a)) while RMS (Fig. \n7(b)) and IED (Fig. 7(c)) are calculated based on the \nremaining 11 features. As can be seen in Fig. 7 (a -c), CBD, \nRMS and IED values are increasing consistently with the \nincrease in fault level. \nTable 3  The 15 extracted features of 10kVA transformer \nLV winding forced buckling \nFeature \nFault level \n1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 40% \ng1 9387 9362 9359 9344 9336 8793 \ng2 486.82 486.43 486.11 485.79 485.63 472.73 \ng3 (X) 338.86 338.59 338.52 338.47 338.28 337.12 \ng3 (Y) 288.96 288.78 288.57 288.44 288.38 288.07 \ng4(Maj.) 220.18 219.54 218.63 217.82 216.91 214.21 \ng4(Min.) 59.22 59.21 59.19 59.18 59.16 58.44 \nCBD 222.8 249.29 253.82 270.14 279.48 617.47 \nΦ1 0.4751 0.4754 0.4758 0.4761 0.4767 0.4801 \nΦ2 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 \nΦ3 0.0016 0.0014 0.0013 0.0012 0.0011 0.0008 \nΦ4 -0.0074 -0.0071 -0.0067 -0.0061 -0.0058 -0.0033 \nΦ5 1.7428 1.7431 1.7438 1.7452 1.7464 1.7892 \nΦ6 0.4427 0.4438 0.4453 0.4466 0.4482 0.4816 \nΦ7 1.4322 1.4317 1.4311 1.4309 1.4305 1.4293 \n𝜏1 0.0605 0.0601 0.0597 0.0592 0.0586 0.0580 \n𝜏2 1.9725 1.9736 1.9757 1.9778 1.9789 1.9806 \n𝜏3 1.8627 1.8633 1.8667 1.8679 1.8681 1.8723 \n𝜏4 0.5086 0.5094 0.5103 0.5118 0.5129 0.5174 \nRMS 1.092663 1.093005 1.094014 1.094845 1.095310 1.103955 \nIED 0.014615 0.015973 0.019156 0.021878 0.024046 0.026640 \n \n5.1.2 Free radial buckling on the HV winding \n      Various free radial buckling levels (1% to 5% and 40%) \nare simulated on phase-A of the10 kVA transformer HV \nwindings using FEA at three locations; top (disk 1), middle \n(disk 3) and bottom (disk 6). The impacts of 1% to 5% fault \nlevels on the conventional FRA signature reveal the \nimpediments and barriers of the current FRA practice in  \nidentifying incipient fault location and quantifying their \nlevels. The proposed polar plot signatures for the \ninvestigated fault levels and locations are obtained and \nmanipulated using the developed DIP code to calculate the \nthree metrics; CBD, RMS and IE D as given in Table 4. \nSimilar to the previous case study, Table 4 shows that the \nthree metrics are also increasing with the increase in fault \nlevel. On the other hand, Fig. 7 (d -f) reveals that the three \nmetrics are increasing when the fault moves toward the \nbottom of the HV winding.  This may be attributed to the \nfact that, HV winding radial deformation is mainly affecting \nthe shunt capacitive component s between the deformed \nlocation and the core / tank [28]. As can be noticed from the \nphysical dimensions of the two investigated transformers \n(Fig. 2), the distance between the bottom of the HV winding \nand the bottom yoke of the transformer core is smaller than \nthat of the top side and hence the radial deformation at the \nbottom section of the winding will have more effect on the \nFRA signature than the top section.    \n \nFig. 7.

As can be seen, the 3 metrics are \nincreasing with the increase in fault level and they are \nincreasing when the fault moves toward the bottom of the \nwindings; same trend was obtained for the  10kVA \ntransformer. \nTable 6  CBD, RMS and IED metrics of 40MVA \ntransformer HV winding free buckling  \nLocation Top disk \nMetric 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 40% \nCBD 941.84 965.97 980.73 987.52 1004.69 1344.49 \nRMS 1.57215 1.573873 1.576275 1.578795 1.580303 1.619634 \nIED 0.281049 0.28993 0.300165 0.311271 0.320055 0.488266 \nLocation Middle disk \nCBD 1051.39 1073 1088.05 1106.13 1129.6 1599.49 \nRMS 1.582195 1.583944 1.586586 1.5886 1.592824 1.624762 \nIED 0.331635 0.340728 0.351494 0.361095 0.380253 0.510495 \nLocation Bottom disk \nCBD 1171.3 1197.43 1215.81 1236.76 1246.95 1737.26 \nRMS 1.595576 1.597488 1.599812 1.601428 1.603986 1.628125 \nIED 0.391897 0.401446 0.412775 0.421305 0.434006 0.52456 \n6. Experimental validation  \nExperimental measurements have been conducted on \na single phase 2kVA, 250/120 volts, dry type transformer. \nPhysical radial buckling with levels of 3% and 8% have \nbeen staged on the transformer external winding. A \nfrequency response analyser is used to meas ure the \ntransformer FRA signature with the healthy and deformed \nwinding. Also, FEA is used to simulate a 3D -model of the \ninvestigated transformer to compare simulation and practical \nresults. Fig. 9 shows good agreement between the FRA \nsignatures for the he althy and deformed winding when \nobtained through FEA simulation and practical \nmeasurements. Results in Fig. 9 also show the difficulty of \nidentifying the fault using conventional FRA signature. The \npolar plot signatures are obtained and processed using the  \nproposed DIP code. The 15 features are used to calculate the \nthree proposed metrics for both simulation and practical \nresults as listed in Table 7. Similar to above case studies, the \nthree metrics are increasing with the increase in radial \nbuckling level. It can also be observed that experimental and \nsimulation analysis results have almost similar metrics \nvalues which reveal the feasibility of the proposed approach. \n \nFig. 9.

Comparison with numerical techniques \n    As previously mentioned, a few studies introduced some \nnumerical metrics such as CC and ASLE calculated from the \nFRA magnitude signature  to ease the FRA interpretation \nprocess. These indicators are not widely accepted as reliable \ntools to analyse the FRA signature as reported in several \npublications in the literature [ 8-12]. In order to justify this \nclaim, the magnitude of the FRA signatures for forced \nbuckling levels within the 10kVA transformer is used to \ncalculate the CC and ASLE over a frequency range 10Hz to \n1 MHz at step of 100 Hz as per (3) and (4) below. \nCC=\n∑ 𝑋𝑖𝑌𝑖𝑛=1\n√∑ [𝑋𝑖]2𝑛\n𝑖=1 ∑ [𝑌𝑖]2𝑛\n𝑖=1\n                       (3) \n      ASLE=\n∑ 𝑌𝑖−𝑛=1 𝑋𝑖\n𝑛                            (4) \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n6 \n \nwhere n represents the total number of points of the FRA \nmagnitude data, Xi and Yi are the ith elements of the reference \nand measured signatures; respectively. \n     Table 8 shows these metrics along with the three DIP -\nbased classification metrics proposed in this paper. Results \nshow the inconstant trend for the CC.  For example, a fault \nlevel of 5% results in a higher correlation between the faulty \nand healthy signatures than that of the 2% fault level. On the \nother hand, ASLE that should be zero in case of perfect \ncorrelated signatures is not consistent with the fault level \neither. For instance a fault level of 4% leads to ASLE of \n0.069 while a fault level of 1% leads to 1.302%. \nTable 8  Statistical and DIP -based metrics for forced radial \nbuckling fault (10kVA transformer) \nFault \nlevel CC ASLE CBD RMS IED \n1% 0.621 1. 302 222.8 1.092663 0.014615 \n2% 0.057 0.012 249.29 1.093005 0.015973 \n3% 0.914 0.856 253.82 1.094014 0.019156 \n4% 0.088 0.069 270.14 1.094845 0.021878 \n5% 0.696 1.192 279.48 1.095310 0.024046 \n \nThis finding aligns well with the results reported in the \nliterature that conclude the imprecision of statistical -based \nmetrics in the FRA signature analysis [11-13]. As shown in \nTable 8, the proposed DIP -based metrics reveal consistent \ntrend with the fault level which facilitates the identification \nand quantifi cation of transformer winding radial \ndeformations. \n8. Comparison with other fault types \n       To show the suitability of the proposed technique to \nidentify and quantify various winding deformation types, \nresults obtained for transformer winding radial deformation \npresented in this paper are compared with the results \nobtained for other winding fault types such as short circuit \nturns, axial displacement and disk space variation presented \nin the literature [1 4-16] in which the same investigated \ntransformers were used.  \n    Table 9  presents the fault threshold levels for various \nwinding faults when applied to the LV and HV windings of \nthe 10 kVA and 40 MVA transformers. As shown in the \ntable, there is no overlapping between threshold bands of the \nthree metrics within each fault type. As few metrics of some \nfaults can probably overlapped, one should look at the three \ncombined metrics to correctly identify and quantify various \nfaults. In some cases, looking at the individual extracted \nfeatures (physical dimensions, invariant moments and \ntexture analysis) may be of a great help to distinguish \nvarious fault types.  \n    Through identifying the threshold fault limits for a \nparticular transformer; a healthy signature can be reported if \nand only if all three measured metrics are less than the \nminimum threshold of minor fault level which is 1%.  Minor \nfault can be reported if at least one metric has a value  \nbetween the proposed minim um and maximum threshold \nlimits while a ma jor fault is reported if at least one metric \nviolates the maximum threshold level.  \n \nTable 9 Threshold levels for minor faults within the LV and \nHV windings of the 10kVA and 40MVA transformers \n \n9. Conclusion \nCurrent FRA interpretation technique mainly relies  \non personal expertise which may result in inconsistent \nreports for the same FRA signature. Moreover, it is \nextremely hard to identify and quantify incipient mechanical \ndeformations of low fault levels using the conventional FRA \ninterpretation technique. T his paper investigates the ability \nof polar plot  and digital image processing techniques  to \nidentify and quantify transformer winding radial \ndeformations. The DIP techniques are employed to extract \nthe various polar plot image features including geometric,  \ninvariant moments and texture analysis features. The \nextracted features are used to calculate three unique \nclassification parameters namely; city -block distance, root \nmean square and image Euclidean distance. The proposed \napproach is successfully used to identify and quantify radial \nFault location \nShort circuit turns faults \nCBD RMS IED \nMin Max Min Max Min Max \n10 kVA \nLV 7.76 154.23 1.096004 1.097390 0.025059 0.040158 \nHV/Top  5.59 39.19 0.872592 0.873590 0.048710 0.055358 \nHV/Middle  52.67 90.78 0.874080 0.875160 0.059371 0.067228 \nHV/Bottom  96.05 162.36 0.875582 0.875160 0.070316 0.078710 \n40 MVA \nLV 11.53 82.44 2.395078 2.409629 0.225213 0.292433 \nHV/Top  120.10 191.43 1.538625 1.539514 0.011122 0.020432 \nHV/Middle  459.94 552.53 1.542315 1.543488 0.048348 0.055787 \nHV/Bottom  691.21 776.56 1.565419 1.097390 0.152844 0.158306 \n \nAxial Displacement \nCBD RMS IED \nMin Max Min Max Min Max \n10 kVA LV 188.94 326.71 1.083577 1.073861 0.060020 0.117762 \nHV 80.06 139.77 0.848081 0.845222 0.058820 0.073257 \n40 MVA LV 1176.95 1324.24 2.340710 2.339454 1.534702 1.533434 \nHV 1296.79 1872.78 0.032238 0.057177 0.042565 0.059580 \n \nDisk Space Variation \nCBD RMS IED \nMin Max Min Max Min Max \n10 kVA \nHV/Top 7.83 16.13 0.863410 0.863081 0.001631 0.004133 \nHV/Middle 20.30 27.64 0.862852 0.862438 0.005696 0.008311 \nHV/Bottom 29.78 38.15 0.862181 0.861758 0.009898 0.014516 \n40 MVA HV/Top 13.37 29.06 1.538193 1.537999 0.003231 0.004326 \nHV/Middle 33.82 53.09 1.537820 1.537635 0.005492 0.007080 \nHV/Bottom 63.86 81.73 1.537483 1.537298 0.008360 0.009920 \n \nRadial buckling \nCBD RMS IED \nMin Max Min Max Min Max \n10 kVA \nLV 222.80 617.47 1.092663 1.103955 0.014615 0.026640 \nHV/Top  175.35 206.69 0.867664 0.868265 0.024130 0.025718 \nHV/Middle  230.42 252.87 0.869144 0.869756 0.032377 0.034196 \nHV/Bottom  269.26 305.45 0.870091 0.870692 0.046231 0.048521 \n40 MVA \nLV 1820.93 1887.86 2.416197 2.418698 0.355873 0.369640 \nHV/Top  941.84 1004.69 1.572150 1.580303 0.281049 0.320055 \nHV/Middle  1051.39 1129.60 1.582195 1.592824 0.331635 0.380253 \nHV/Bottom  1171.30 1246.95 1.595576 1.603986 0.391897 0.434006 \n \n7 \n \ndeformation within the windings of two power transformers. \nFeasibility of the proposed approach has been validated \nthrough experimental measurements.
