    "abstract": "This paper proposes an iterative method for in situ lens aberration measurement in lithographic tools based on a quadratic aberration model (QAM) that is a natural extension of the linear model formed by taking into account interactions among individual Zernike coefficients. By introducing a generalized operator named cross triple correlation (CTC), the quadratic model can be calculated very quickly and accurately with the help of fast Fourier transform (FFT). The Zernike coefficients up to the 37th order or even higher are determined by solving an inverse problem through an iterative procedure from several through-focus aerial images of a specially designed mask pattern. The simulation work has validated the theoretical derivation and confirms that such a method is simple to implement and yields a superior quality of wavefront estimate, particularly for the case when the aberrations are relatively large. It is fully expected that this method will provide a useful practical means for the in-line monitoring of the imaging quality of lithographic tools.",
