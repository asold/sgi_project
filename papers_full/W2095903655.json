INTRODUCTION \nThe characterization and study of artificial ma terials is an important topic in modern \nelectromagnetics. It has been suggested that properly designed microstructured composite \nmaterials may enable the realization of compact resonators, cavities, and waveguides that may \nsurpass diffraction limits [1, 2, 3], and allow fo r the selective interact ion of electromagnetic \nwaves with objects or particles much smaller than the wavelength. Other interesting potentials \nof these microstructured materials include th e realization of imaging devices with super-\nresolution [4]-[8], or squeezing electromagnetic waves through subwavelength narrow \nchannels [9] with a gigantic electric field enhancement. \nThe objective of this work is to characterize the electromagnetic properties of an array of \ninfinitely long helices, and investigate its pos sible application to the design of polarization \ntransformation screens. Even though the study of  artificial chiral media made of metallic \nhelices is an old subject dating back to the beginning of the 20\nth century [10]-[11], recently \nthere has been a renewed interest in the properties of these composite materials after the \nsuggestion of Tretyakov [12] that a racemic mixture of canonical helices may yield an \neffective medium with negative parameters. A related proposal/opportunity to obtain negative \nrefraction using chiral materials was also identified in [13]. In this work we explore a \ndifferent application of artificial chiral media, namely the possibility of designing a \nmetamaterial screen to transform an incoming linear polarized wave into a circularly \npolarized wave. \nIt is well-known [11, 14, 15], that bi-isotropic chiral media have the ability to rotate the \npolarization state of an electromagnetic wave (gyrotropy), but that the ellipticity of the \nelectric field (axis ratio of the polarization ellipse) remains unchanged. However, for certain \napplications at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies it may be interesting to transform \nthe ellipticity of the incoming wave, rather than just to rotate its polarization state. Here, we \npropose a novel realistic metamaterial design of such polarization transformer. From a \nconceptual point of view, our approach is clos ely related with the proposal of [11, pp. 286], \nwhere it is suggested that a uniaxial chiral material slab may behave as a polarization \ntransformer. Similarly, we suggest using an array of very long densely packed metallic helices \nas a polarization transformer, exploiting the extreme anisotropy of such metamaterial and also \nthe effects of the chirality. The main idea, as it will be explained ahead in details, is to tailor \nthe electromagnetic modes of the metamaterial so that one of the modes is near cut-off (due to \nthe anisotropy of the material) and the other m ode propagates with circular polarization (due \nto the chiral effects). \n In order to characterize the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the composite \nmaterial, we apply the homogenization method proposed in [16] to derive an approximate \nanalytical model for the dielectric function of a medium formed by infinitely long metallic \nhelices, taking into account spatial dispersion effects. We prove that under some conditions \nthe metamaterial can be described in terms of effective permittivity and permeability tensors \nand a magnetoelectric tensor which is a manifestation of the chiral effects. It is shown that the \nresults predicted by our analytical model compare well with full wave band structure \ncalculations, even when the helices are tightly packed (with high volume fractions), or when \nthe helix pitch is small. It is important to mention that in [17] a related spiral medium was \nhomogenized using a local field theory. The main difference between our results and the \nresults presented in [17] is that our model describes a completely realistic physical structure, \nwhile in [17] the derived model is only approxim ate since the specific microstructure of the \nmedium is partially ignored, and the spirals are modeled using an equivalent impedance. Due \nto this reason, the results of [17] are limited to the case in which the radius of the helices is \nmuch smaller than the lattice constant. In a different way, the solution that we derive here \ndoes not suffer from this inconvenience, and is valid even when the helices are closely \npacked. As discussed ahead, only in this configuration a significant magnetoelectric coupling \n(which is important for the polarization-transformer application) may be induced. \nWe use the derived homogenization model to characterize the reflection/transmission of \nwaves by a finite slab of the metamaterial. Our study confirms that it may be possible to \ndesign the helices and tune the thickness of the metamaterial in such a way that a linearly \npolarized incoming wave is transformed into a wave with circular polarization. Moreover, it is \nshown that the efficiency of the proposed polar ization transformer can be very high, with a \nreflection loss as small as 5% in some cases, and a good bandwidth. \nThis paper is organized as follows. In section II we go over the homogenization method \nintroduced in [16], and briefly review the consti tutive relations in bianisotropic media and in \nspatially dispersive media. Then, in section III we use the homogenization approach proposed \nin [16] to extract the effective parameters of the medium formed by a square lattice of \ninfinitely long helices. In section IV, we study the properties of the plane waves supported by \nthe artificial medium. In section V we use th e new model to investigate the opportunity of \ndesigning polarization conversion screens. Finally, in section VI the conclusion is drawn. \nIn this work, we assume that the fields are monochromatic and that the time dependence is \njte ω .  \nII. GEOMETRY OF THE MATERIAL AND OVERVIEW OF THE HOMOGENIZATION \nMETHOD \nIn this section, we present a brief overview of the homogenization procedure introduced in \n[16] and we review the constitutive relations in bianisotropic and spatially dispersive media.  \nA. Geometry \nTo begin with, we describe the geometry of the metamaterial under study (Fig. 1). It \nconsists of a periodic array of infinitely lo ng perfectly electrical conducting (PEC) helices. \nThe helices are arranged into a square  lattice, with lattice constant a . For simplicity, we \nassume that the helices are embedded in air. The parameterization of the axis of the helix \ninside the unit cell (one turn of the helix) is: \n()0 cos , sin , 2\nuuR u R u p π\n⎛⎞=⎜⎟⎝⎠\nr ,  uπ π− <<     (1) \nwhere u  is the parameterization variable, R is the radius of the helix, and 0>p  when the \nhelix is right-handed (RH) and 0<p  when the helix is left-hande d (LH). The wire radius is \nwr . The metamaterial is obtained by the periodic repetition of the unit cell defined by the \nprimitive vectors 1 ˆxa=au , 2 ˆya=au , and 3 ˆz za=au , as illustrated in Fig. 1. Note that the \nhelix pitch is such that zap= . The helix surface D∂  is parameterized as explained in \nAppendix A.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1 Geometry of a periodic array of infinitely long PEC helices arranged in a square lattice. \n\nB. Constitutive relations \nSince the artificial material under study ha s gyrotropic properties and, as discussed \nahead, may exhibit strong spatial dispersion, it is appropriate to review some elementary \nconcepts related with the homogenization of bianisotropic media and spatially dispersive \nmedia.  \nThe effective parameters of a periodic material are intrinsically related with the \nproperties of its Floquet modes. As proved in [16, 18], the macroscopic average electric field \navE  and the macroscopic induction field avB  associated with an electromagnetic Floquet \nmode ( ),EB  verify, \nav av 0ω−× + =kE B         ( 2 a )  \n()\nav\n0a v\n0\n0gωε μ++ ×= BEPk        ( 2 b )  \nwhere ( ),,x yzkkk=k  is the wave vector characteristic of the mode, ω is the frequency, and \ngP  is the generalized polarization vector, which in the long wavelength limit may be written \nin terms of the classical polarization vector P  (average electric dipole moment in a unit cell) \nand the magnetization vector M  (averaged magnetic dipole moment in a unit cell): \n3\ncell\n1\nV\nj\ngd edjωωΩ\n=≈ − × ∫\nk.r kPJ r P M      (3) \nIn the above, cellV  is the volume of the unit cell, and ( )0d jωε ε=−JE  is the microscopic \npolarization current. The decomposition g\nω≈ −×kPP M  motivates the introduction of the \nclassical (macroscopic) elec tric displacement vector avD  and of the (macroscopic) magnetic \nfield avH , through the textbook formulas: \nav 0 avε=+DE P         ( 4 a )  \nav\nav\n0μ=−BHM         ( 4 b )  \nIn particular, substituting (4) into (2b) we obtain that the classical relation between avD  and \navH  for plane waves: \nav av 0ω +× =Dk H         ( 5 )  \nFor local linear (bianisotropic) media [11], it is possible to find a (relative) permittivity tensor  \n()rε ω , a (relative) permeability tensor ()rμ ω , and  (dimensionless) parameters that \ncharacterize the magnetoelectric coupling ()ξ ω  and ()ζ ω , such that the artificial material is \ncharacterized by the classical constitutive relations: \nav 0 av 0 0 avrεε εμξ=+D. E . H       ( 6 a )  \nav 0 0 av 0 av rεμζ μμ=+B. E . H       ( 6 b )  \nThe properties of the plane wave solutions in the artificial medium (dispersion relation \n( )ωω= k  and polarization of the fields) are completely determined by (2a), (5) and by the \nclassical constitutive relations (6). \nAs discussed in [16, 19], for nonlocal media (i .e. spatially dispersive media) the classical \nmodel described before may not apply, and it may be convenient to adopt different \nphenomenological constitutive relations. Inde ed, for these materials, in general, the \ndecomposition g\nω≈−× kPP M  may not either be possible or be meaningful. Thus, instead of \nintroducing local parameters such as ()rε ω  or ()rμ ω , it is preferable to directly relate the \naverage electric field avE  with the generalized polarization vector gP . To this end, a \ngeneralized displacement vector gD  is introduced through the relation 0a vg gε=+DE P . The \neffective parameters of the composite material are then characterized by a dielectric function, \n() ,eff effεε ω= k , defined in such a way that: \n()0a v a v ,gg e f fεε ω≡+ =DE P k . E        ( 7 )  \nNotice that the dielectric function depends on both frequency and wave vector.  Substituting \n(7) into (2) we readily find that: \nav av 0ω−× + =kE B         ( 8 a )  \nav\nav\n0\n0effωε μ+× =B.E k        ( 8 b )  \nAs discussed in [16], the plane wave solutions in the artificial medium can be completely \ncharacterized by (8) and by the dielectric function () ,effεω k . For future reference, we note \nthat local media characterized by the classical constitutive relations (6) can be as well \ndescribed by a dielectric function of the form () ,eff effεε ω= k  [20]. In fact, using (6) and the \ndecomposition g\nω≈−× kPP M  it is trivial to relate gP  and avE  as in (7). We obtain the \nfollowing relation between the local parameters ()rε ω , etc, and the dielectric function \n() ,eff effεε ω= k : \n()\n11 1 1\n0\n,\neff\nrr r r r\nε ωε ξ μ ζ ξ μ μ ζ με ββ β β\n−− − − ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞=− + ×−× +× −× ⎜⎟⎜⎟ ⎝⎠⎝⎠\nkk k kk. . . . I       (9) \nwhere 00β ωε μ=  is the free-space wave number and I  is the identity dyadic. However, the \nconverse is not true, i.e. media described by a general dielectric function () ,eff effεε ω= k  in \ngeneral cannot be described by local parameters ()rε ω , ()rμ ω , etc.  \nIn summary, both local and nonlocal (spatially dispersive) media can be always \ncharacterized by a dielectric function of the form () ,eff effεε ω= k , associated with the \nfundamental constitutive relation (7). On the other hand, local media can also be described by \nthe classical constitutive relations (6) with local effective parameters. It is simple to verify \nthat in unbounded media (without interfaces) both formalisms are equivalent. However, in \nproblems involving interfaces and boundaries between different media, the classical model (6) \nhas several important advantages as compared to the nonlocal model (7) [16, 20]. This matter \nwill be discussed ahead in the paper. \nC. Calculation of the dielectric function \nIn a recent work [16], we introduced a new, completely general and systematic approach \nto homogenize arbitrary non-magnetic periodic materials. The new method can fully \ncharacterize frequency dispersion, the magnetoele ctric coupling (bianisotropic effects), and \nspatial dispersion of novel artificial media, even in frequency band-gaps or when the \nconstituent materials are lossy. Instead of directly extracting the local parameters \n(permittivity, permeability, etc) of the material, the method first calculates the dielectric \nfunction \n() ,eff effεε ω= k  of the metamaterial. As discussed in [16], this approach has several \nadvantages, namely it is computationally simpler and allows describing both local and \nnonlocal artificial materials in a unified manner. On the other hand, it is always possible to \nextract the local parameters (if they are meaningful) from the dielectric function \n() ,eff effεε ω= k . In fact, the local effective permeabili ty and the magnetoelectric tensors may \nbe related with the first and second order derivatives of the dielectric function at 0=k , \nrespectively [16, 19], as is apparent from (9). \nThe main idea of the method proposed in [16] is to calculate, for fixed () ,ω k , the \nmicroscopic fields induced in the electromagnetic crystal when it is excited by a periodic \nexternal uniform harmonic electric current density of the form ,av\nj\next e e−= k.rJJ , where k  is \nthe wave vector that defines the phase shift from cell to cell, and ,aveJ  is a constant vector that \ndefines the amplitude of the source (and indirectly the average macroscopic field avE ). Using \nthe calculated microscopic fields, we can then characterize the generalized  polarization vector \ngP , given by (3), and afterwards it is possible to determine the dielectric function defined as \nin (7). For further details about the homogeniza tion procedure the reader is referred to [16]. \nAn important outcome of the theory presented in [16] – resulting from a method of moments \n(MoM) based solution of the problem – is that th e dielectric function can be written is closed \nanalytical form in terms of the expansion functions \n,n kw   (of the induced microscopic \ncurrents) adopted in the MoM implementation. For the particular case in which the inclusions \nare metallic (PEC) it is proved in [16] that the dielectric function is given by: \n() () ()\n,\n,,\n,0 cell\n1, V\neff mn j j\nmn\nmn DD\ned s ed sε ωχε\n+−\n−\n∂∂\n=+ ∑ ∫∫\nk.r k.r\nkkkI w r w r   (10a) \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )\n2\n,, , , , 0m n sm sn m n p\nDD\nds dsχβ −−\n∂∂\n′ ′′ ′ ′=∇ ∇ − Φ∫∫ kk k k.w r .w r w r .w r r r   (10b) \n \nIn above D∂  is the surface of the metallic inclusion in the unit cell, ,n kw  (n=1,2,3…) form a \ncomplete set of tangential vector fields defined over D∂  (used for the expansion of the \nelectric current density over the PEC surface), s∇ .  stands for the surface divergence of a \ntangential vector field, 00β ωε μ=  is the free-space wave number, 0pΦ  is a Green function, \nand the matrix [ ]nm,χ  is the inverse of [ ]nm,χ .  \nThe Green function 0pΦ  may be evaluated as explained in [16] and depends on both ω \nand k . In this work, we use assume that the long-wavelength limit approximation holds, i.e. \nthat aβ π\u0013  and a πk \u0013 . Using this hypothesis, and for the geometry of Fig. 1, we can \nwrite that (see [16]): \n()\n() ()0\n0 00\ncellV\njj\np\nee\n′′−− − −\n≠\n′Φ≈ ∑\nJk . rr k. rr\nJ0 JJ\nrr k. k  ,      0 3122, ,\nz\njjj\naaaπ⎛⎞= ⎜⎟\n⎝⎠\nJk    (11) \nwhere ( )123,,j jj=J  is a generic multi-index of integers, and 0≠J . Notice that when written \nas above, ()\n0\nj\np e\n′+−\nΦ\nk. r r\n becomes independent of both frequency and wave vector. The series \n(11) can be efficiently summed using the approach presented in [21]. \nIn section III we will use (10) to compute th e dielectric function of the microstructured \nmaterial depicted in Fig. 1. However, instead of presenting a purely numerical answer, we \nwill derive an approximate analytical solution. This has the advantage of giving important \ninsights into the physics of the problem and into the application of the homogenization \napproach. \nIII.\n HOMOGENIZATION OF THE ARTIFICIAL MEDIUM \nNext, we use the formalism presented in the pr evious section to homogenize the artificial \nmaterial formed by an infinite square array of metallic helices  (Fig. 1). Our strategy is to \ncalculate first the dielectric function of the material (sections III.A − III.D), and afterwards to \nextract the effective permittivity, permeability and the magnetoelectric tensors from \n() ,effεω k  (section III.E).  \nA. The expansion functions \nThe first step to calculate the dielectric function () ,effεω k  given by (10) is to choose the \nexpansion functions ,n kw . We remember that the current density cJ  induced on the helix \nsurface by the external source is written in terms of the expansion functions ,n kw  [16]. For \nsimplicity, we will assume that the radius wr  of the metallic wires is relatively small: wra<<  \nand 0wr λ<<  (thin-wire approximation). Within this hypo thesis, it is possible to consider that \nto a first approximation cJ  flows along the helix axis [18]. Hence, the expansion functions of \ncJ  may be taken equal to: \n() ()(),\n1\n2\nj\nnn\nw\nwu u erπ\n−= k.r\nkwr T       ( 1 2 )  \nwhere u  is the variable associated with the parameterization 0r  of the helix axis given by (1),  \n00 rrT ′′=  is the unit vector tangent to the helix axis, ( )nwu  is a generic scalar function \nindependent of k to be chosen ahead, and ( ),u φ=rr  is the parameterization of the helix \nsurface given by (A1). As explained in [16], the expansion functions ( ),nn= kwwr  must have \nthe Floquet property. Thus (12) implie s that the scalar expansion functions ( )nwu  are \nperiodic functions of u  with fundamental period 2π . Hence, a suitable set of expansion \nfunctions is the set of Fourier harmonics: ( ) ( )expnwu j n u= , 0, 1,...n = ± . As referred \nbefore, our objective here is to obtain an  approximate analytical solution of the \nhomogenization problem, rather than to obtain a numerical solution. For low frequencies it is \nexpected that the induced current density cJ  varies relatively slowly in one cell (see [18] for a \nrelated discussion). Hence, we expect that th e behavior of the low frequency electromagnetic \nmodes may be well described by only a few slowly varying expansion functions. Based on \nsuch physical considerations, in this work we will retain only (a linear combination of) the \nfirst 3 expansion functions. More specifically, we take the expansion functions equal to: \n( )1 sinwu u =−  ;  ( )2 coswu u =   ;   ()3 1wu =  (13) \nIn what follows, we will calculate the dielectric function of the composite medium using these \nsimplifying hypotheses. Ahead, we will compare this approximate theory with full wave \nsimulations confirming that our simplified model yields indeed accurate results. \nFor future reference, we note that when the expansion functions are of the form (12) the \ndielectric function given by (10) can be rewritten as: \n() () ()\n, 00\n,cell\n1, V\neff mn\nmn\nmnh\nddw u du w u dudu du\nε ωχε\n′ ′=+ ′∑ ∫∫\nrrkI     (14) \nwhere 2\ncellV ap=  is the volume of the unity cell. Similarly, using the results of Appendix A \nand (10), one finds that, \n() () ()\n200 0 0\n, 0..mn\nmn m n m n p\ndw d dw d d ddu du j w j w w u w u K u udu du du du du duχβ ⎛⎞⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞′′ ′=+ − − ⎜⎟⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ′′ ′⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎝⎠∫∫\nrr r rkk .\n(15) \n() () () ()\n22\n00 2\n00\n1 \n2\nj\nppKu u d d e\nππ\nφφ\nπ\n′−′′ ′=Φ ∫∫\nk. r r\nrr     (16) \nNotice that in (16) we put ( ),u φ=rr  and ( ),u φ′ ′′=rr , which are defined as in (A1). We \nalso refer that because of (11), the periodic thin-wire kernel defined above, ( )0pK uu ′ , is \nindependent of both frequency and wave vector. \nB. Calculation of nm,χ  \nIn order to obtain the effective permittivity using (14), next we calculate the elements \nnm,χ . To begin with, we note that ( ) ( ),,mn nmχχ = −kk , and thus it is sufficient to calculate \nnm,χ  for mn ≥ . These elements can be written as linear combinations of integrals of the type: \n() ( )\n()\n( )\n()\n0\nsin sin\ncos cos\np\nmu nu\ndudu K u u\nmu nu\nππ\nππ−−\n′⎧⎧⎪⎪′′ ××⎨⎨ ′⎪⎪⎩⎩\n∫∫ , 2,1,0, =nm    (17) \nAll the above integrals are identically zero, except if the function associated with the primed \nand unprimed coordinates is the same. This  property is proved in Appendix C. For \nconvenience, we introduce the following parameters (which only depend on the geometry of \nthe metamaterial):  \n()() ()0cos cosmpC dudu mu mu K u u\nππ\nππ−−\n′′ ′= ∫∫ ,  2,1,0=m   (18a) \n()( ) ()0sin sinmpC dudu mu mu K u u\nππ\nππ−−\n′′ ′= ∫∫\u0004 ,  2,1=m   (18b) \nThe unities of mC  and mC\u0004  are 1m−⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦. We prove in Appendix C that 11\n~CC = . Using the \nprevious definitions and results, we obtain af ter straightforward calculations that (the \nformulas are exact): \n()\n()\n22 2\n22 2\n11 1 0 2 2 1\n22\n2\n10 2 2\n22 2\n                            22\nxy z\nRR pCC C k C k C k\npR CC C C\nχ π\nβ π\n⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞=+ + + +⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠\n⎛⎞⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞−+ + +⎜⎟⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎜⎟⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎝⎠\n\u0004\n\u0004\n   (19a) \n()\n2\n12 1 0 2 2 222\nz xy\npRj Ck C C C k kχ π\n⎛⎞=+ + − ⎜⎟⎝⎠\n\u0004      (19b) \n0\n13 1 1\n22\nyx z\nCpjRC k R C k kχ π\n⎛⎞=+ + ⎜⎟⎝⎠\n      ( 1 9 c )  \n0\n23 1 1\n22\nx yz\nCpjRC k R C k kχ π\n⎛⎞=− + + ⎜⎟⎝⎠\n     (19d) \n()\n22\n22 2 2 2 2\n33 1 0 1 0  222\nxy z\nppRC k k Ck RC Cχ βππ\n⎛⎞⎛⎞ ⎛⎞=+ + − + ⎜⎟⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠\n  (19e) \nFinally, 22χ  is obtained from 11χ  by interchanging the symbols xk  and yk , and the \nremaining elements can be obtained using the relation ( ) ( ),,mn nmχχ = −kk . \nC. Calculation of nm,χ  \nHere, we calculate ,mnχ⎡⎤⎣⎦ , which is the inverse of the matrix ,mnχ⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦. These parameters \ncan be written in closed analytical form, but the formulas are cumbersome. To circumvent this \ninconvenience, we will use the long wavelength limit approximation to simplify the formulas. \nIn order to clarify our approach, let us consider for example the exact formula for 11χ : \n()\n11 22 33 23 32\ndet\nχ χχ χχ χ\n−=\n \n       ( 2 0 )  \nBoth the numerator and denominator of the above formula are polynomial functions of β , \nxk , yk  and zk . In our calculations we only retained the lowest order terms in both the \nnumerator and denominator. Depending on the specific nm,χ  these terms are monomials of \norder one (sum of parcels involving β , xk , etc) or of order two (sum of parcels involving \n2β , x ykk , xkβ , 2\nxk , etc). Within these approximations, we find: \n()\n22\n22 2 2\n10 1 0det  2 22\nz\nppCC k R C Cχ βππ\n⎡⎤ ⎛⎞⎛⎞ ⎛⎞≈− +⎢⎥ ⎜⎟⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟⎝⎠ ⎝⎠⎢⎥ ⎝⎠⎣⎦\n    (21a) \n()\n22 2\n111\n1\n1\ndet\nyCRk\nCχ χ≈+         (21b) \n()\n22\n112\ndet\nx yCRkkχ χ≈−         ( 2 1 c )  \n()\n2\n113\ndet\nyjCR kχ χ\n−≈         (21d) \n()\n2\n23 1\ndet\nxjCR kχ χ\n+≈         ( 2 1 e )  \n()\n2\n33 1\ndet\nCχ χ≈          ( 2 1 f )  \nAs before, 22χ  is obtained from 11χ  by interchanging the symbols xk  and yk , and the \nremaining elements can be obtained using the relation ( ) ( )\n,,mn nmχχ = −kk . \nD.

Bianisotropic model \nIt is evident from (22) that the dielectric function depends explicitly on all components, \nxk , yk , and zk  of the wave vector. Indeed, as explained in section II, our homogenization \nmethod is based on the constitutive relation (7), for which the effect of all microscopic \ncurrents is incorporated into the dielectric f unction, avoiding in this way the introduction of a \npermeability tensor and/or magnetoelectric c oupling tensors. As discussed in [16], if the \nspatial dispersion is relatively weak, i.e. if the dependence of effε  on k  is relatively smooth \nso that we can expand () ,eff effεε ω= k  in a Taylor series in k , it may be possible to find local \nparameters rε , rμ , and ζ  such that to a first approximation (9) holds. In that case it becomes \n\nfeasible to use the local constitutive relations (6) (the bianisotropic model) to characterize \nwave propagation in the medium. As referred in [16], the bianisotropic model – when \navailable – is very useful because if the constitutive parameters are independent of \nk , then \nthe constitutive relations (6) are valid in the spatial domain, and consequently the classical \nboundary conditions (continuity of the tangential components of E  and H ) can be used to \nsolve boundary value problems involving interfaces with free-space [20]. Hence, the \nfollowing question arises naturally: “is the model (22) equivalent to a bianisotropic model \nbased on the constitutive relations (6)?”. Or, in other words, “can we find rε , rμ , and ζ  \nsuch that to some approximation (9) is verified?”.  \nUnfortunately, at least if we impose that rε , rμ , and ζ  are independent of k , the answer \nto the question is negative. This can be easily demonstrated by noting that effε  is a function of \n( )\n22 22\n121/ / / pz p kβ ββ − , and consequently it is obvious that it cannot be expanded into a Taylor \nseries around 0zk =  and 0ω ≈ . Consequently, the artificial medium under-study is \ncharacterized by strong spatial dispersion.  \nEven though, it is not possible to obtain rε , rμ , and ζ  independent of zk  such that to \nsome approximation (9) holds, it is however po ssible to find parameters independent of xk  \nand yk  that verify (9). In fact, it can be confirmed by direct substitution that (9) is exactly \nverified for the following constitutive parameters: \nˆˆ ˆˆ ˆˆr xx yy z zzzμμ=++uu uu uu ,  \n122\n22 22\n12\n1 //\nzz\npz p\nA\nk\nβμ ββ β\n−\n⎛⎞\n=+⎜⎟⎜⎟ −⎝⎠\n      (25a) \n ˆˆ\nt\nzz z zζ ζξ== −uu ,  1\n22 22\n12//\nzz zz\np zp\njA\nk\nβμζ β ββ\n− −= −        (25b) \n( )ˆˆ ˆˆ ˆˆr t xx yy z zzzεε ε=+ +uu uu uu , \n2\n22 22\n12\n11 //\nzz\nzz\np zp z zk\nζε β ββ μ=− − −    (25c) \n          \nWe refer in passing that it is possible to calculate the parameters  defined above in a \nsystematic way in terms of the derivatives of () ,effεω k  with respect to k . Such topic is \noutside the scope of the present paper. We also note that the effective parameters defined by \n(25) depend on the frequency, / cβ ω= , and on the wave vector component zk . \nIs the bianisotropic model (25)  useful? As discussed in [16], the dispersion characteristic \nfor plane waves, ()ωω= k , as well as the corresponding average electric and induction \nfields, avE  and avB , are exactly the same independently of the considered constitutive \nrelations, i.e. independently of using (7) and (22) or using (6) and (25). Thus, from that point \nof view, the bianisotropic model (25) does not bring anything new. Indeed, as noted before, \nthe importance of the bianisotropic model derives from the fact that in general only this model \ncan be used to solve boundary value problems [20]. However, this is true only if the \nassociated constitutive parameters \nrε , rμ , and ζ  are independent of the wave vector k, \nwhich is not the case here since (25) depends explicitly on zk . \nNevertheless, since rε , rμ , and ζ  depend exclusively on zk  (and not on xk  and yk ), \nthey can still be used to impose the classical boundary conditions at an interface, provided the \ngeometry of the problem is effectively two-di mensional (from a macroscopic point of view) \nand the z-direction is parallel to the interface between the metamaterial sample and free-\nspace, e.g., if the metamaterial sample is an ar bitrarily shaped cylinder oriented along the z-\ndirection and the wave propagation is confined to the xoy plane. In fact, in such \ncircumstances, even though the helices are infinitely long along the z-direction, their footprint \nin the xoy plane is electrically small for relativ ely long wavelengths. Thus, for on-plane \npropagation the metamaterial can be homogenized using local parameters (i.e. non-spatially \ndispersive parameters). These parameters are precisely given by the proposed bianisotropic \nmodel (25). Note that since the paramete rs are local, i.e. independent of  xk  and yk  for the \nconsidered 2D-macroscopic geometry, it is possible to impose the classical boundary \nconditions at an interface with free-space. \nHence, the importance of the bianisotropic model (25) is now obvious. Even though it is \nnot useful to solve a generic boundary value pr oblem in which the shape of the metamaterial \nblock is arbitrary (as consequence of the st rong spatial dispersion characteristic of the \nmaterial), it can still be used to solve elec tromagnetic problems which are two-dimensional \nfrom a macroscopic point of view. Again, we underline that for the metamaterial under-study \nthe model based on () ,eff effεε ω= k  and on the constitutive relations (7), is not useful to solve \nsuch a boundary value problem [20]. It can only be used to compute the plane wave solutions \nsupported by an infinite periodic metamateri al. Indeed, in general spatially dispersive \nmaterials may require modified or additional boundary conditions [20, 23]. Only the \nbianisotropic model (25) can be used to solve a boundary value problem, as will be confirmed \nlater in the paper. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3 Effective parameters ( 0zk = ) for a material with 0.4R a= , 0.01wra = , 0.5pa= .  \nTo give an idea of the variation with freque ncy of the effective parameters predicted by \n(25), in Fig. 3 we plot zzε , zzμ  and { }Im zzζ  (chirality), for on-pla ne propagation, i.e. 0 zk =  \n\nand for a material with 0.4R a= , 0.01wra = , 0.5pa= . It is seen that the effective \npermeability is less than one and is indepe ndent of frequency (within the accuracy of the \nproposed model and in the long wavelength li mit approximation). Similarly, the transverse \neffective permittivity (not shown) is 1.77tε = , and is also independent of frequency. On the \nother hand, the effective permittivity along z exhibits a plasmonic behavior. It is also seen that \nthe chirality parameter has a resonant behavior near the static limit. For relatively low \nfrequencies, the described resu lts are qualitatively similar to those reported in [17]. \nNevertheless, the model proposed in [17] is di fferent from ours, possibly because in [17] the \nspecific microstructure of the medium was partially neglected, as well as the effect of the \nhelix polarization in the direction orthogonal to its axis. \nIV.\n PROPERTIES OF THE ARTIFICAL MEDIUM \nThe goal of this section is to characterize the plane wave solutions supported by the \nunbounded artificial material. Before this, it is useful to present a semi-heuristic discussion \nthat gives some physical intuition and insights about the properties of the metamaterial under \nstudy. Thus, consider first the case in which the radius of the helices R  is vanishingly small, \nso that the artificial material reduces to the so-called “wire medium”, formed by an array of \nparallel metallic wires oriented along the \nz-direction [22]. The wire medium supports three \ndistinct types of electromagnetic modes: i) H-polarized modes (also known as TE- z) for \nwhich 0zE =  and 0zH ≠  ii) E-polarized modes (also known as TM- z) for which 0zE ≠  and \n0zH =  iii) transmission line modes (also known as TEM) for which both zE  and zH  vanish \n[22]. It is well-known that for propagation in the xoy-plane and relatively large wavelengths \nthe H-polarized waves propagate without interact ing with the artificial medium, while the E-\npolarized waves are strongly attenuated. \nLet us suppose that each metallic  wire is slightly deformed into a helix, characterized by \nthe radius R and the helix pitch p (see Fig. 1). How does this affect the electromagnetic modes \nin the metallic crystal? A helix is an object with very interesting properties. Geometrically it \nis a chiral object, which means that it cannot be  superimposed on its mirror image [14]. It has \nlong been known that when electromagnetic fields interact with chiral objects there may be a \nstrong magnetoelectric coupling [11, 14], i.e. the induced electric (magnetic) dipole moment \ndepends on both the local electric field and on the local magnetic field.  \nIt is thus simple to understand how the wi nding of the metallic wires may affect the \nproperties of the electromagnetic modes. Consid er first the E-polarized mode with electric \nfield parallel to the \nz-direction. If the straight wires are deformed into helices the current in \nthe loop will induce a magnetic field along the z-direction and consequently an electric field \nin the xoy plane. So the polarization of the pertur bed mode may be no longer linear but, as \nproved ahead, may be elliptical. The perturbed E- polarized mode is characterized by a cut-off \nplasma frequency.  \nConsider now the H-polarized mode. In this case the time varying z-component of the \nmagnetic field induces an electromotive force across each turn of the winding, and so an \nelectric field along the \nz-direction. Therefore, in general, the polarization of the perturbed \nmode is elliptical. An important point is that the H-polarized perturbed mode has not a cut-off \nfrequency. In fact it propagates for arbitrarily large wavelengths, even though the electric field \nalong the z-direction may be different from zero. Of course, in the static limit the polarization \nstate is linear (i.e. the axis ratio of the polarization ellipse approaches zero as the frequency \nalso does).  \nAfter these preliminary considerations and insights, we are ready to characterize the \nelectromagnetic modes in the metamaterial. As referred in sectio n III.E, the dispersion \ncharacteristic of the unbounded medium can be ca lculated either using the dielectric function \n(22) or alternatively the bianisotropic model (25). Both approaches yield exactly the same \nresults. We chose the first option. As proved in [16], the corresponding dispersion \ncharacteristic is given by (assuming that the electric field is not transverse, i.e. 0 av ≠k.E ; the \ntransverse case can be studied using a perturbation technique): \n.kIk.\n1\n221\n−\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n−=− k\nh\neff\nε\nεβ         ( 2 6 )  \nThe average macroscopic electric field associated with a solution ( )ββ= k  of the above \nequation is given by: \nββε\nε k.IE\n1\n2\n2\nav\n−\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n−∝ k\nh\neff\n,         ( 2 7 )  \nThe macroscopic induction field can be calculated using (8a).  \nSubstituting the dielectric function (22) into (26) it can be proven that after some \nsimplifications the characteristic equation can be rewritten in the form, \n64 2\n210 0qqqβββ+++ =             ( 2 8 )  \nwhere 2q , 1q  and 0q  are polynomial functions of the wave vector k . Since the expressions \nfor 2q , 1q  and 0q  are relatively cumbersome they are not shown here (more details are given \nahead for the case of on-plane propagation, whic h is particularly important for the design of \npolarization conversion screens). It is seen fro m (28) that the characteristic equation is a \npolynomial of order 3 in the variable 2β . Thus, for each wave vector k  there are 3 different \n(positive) solutions for / cβ ω= , i.e. our homogenization model predicts that in the long \nwavelength limit 3 different modes may propagate in the metamaterial. This situation \ncontrasts sharply with the electrodynamics of common natural media, where only two \nindependent modes are supported (i.e. only two distinct polarizations are allowed in common \nnatural media). The emergence of the third electromagnetic mode in the artificial material is \nobviously related to strong spatial dispersion.  This phenomenon occurs because the helical \ninclusions are infinitely long objects along the z-direction, and thus they cannot be considered \nelectrically small, even in the static limit. This effect is well understood and studied for the \ncase of straight metallic wires [18], [22], [23] and was also reported in [17]. \nFollowing our initial heuristic discussion, we expect that the electromagnetic modes \nsupported by the metamaterial are E-polarize d perturbed modes, H-polarized perturbed \nmodes, and transmission line perturbed modes. The E- and H-polarized perturbed modes were \nalready discussed before. On the other hand, the transmission line modes correspond to waves \nthat propagate essentially along the wires, i.e. the corresponding Poynting vector is essentially \ndirected along the \nz-direction, independently of the transverse wave vector component \n( )|| ,, 0xykk=k . Note that for the case of straight wires [22], the transmission line modes are \nexactly dispersionless with respect to ||k , and propagate along the wires with the speed of \nlight. As reported ahead, in case of helical wires the transmission line modes propagate along \nz with a velocity smaller than the speed light, since the propagation path is partially blocked \nby the helical turns. Also, for the case of helical wires the dispersion characteristic ( )ββ= k  \nof the transmission line modes is not exactly independent of ||k , even though for small \nfrequencies such property may be valid to a firs t approximation. A detailed discussion of the \nproperties of the transmission line modes is out  of the scope of this paper, and will be \npublished elsewhere.  \nTo better understand the properties of the electr omagnetic modes, it is useful to consider \nthe particular case in which the wave travels in the xoy-plane (this is the situation of interest \nfor the design of polarization transformers). For this configuration, supposing that 0 zk = , it is \nstraightforward to prove that the dispersion charac teristic of the 3 different families of modes \n(given by the solution of (26) using (22)) is, \n() () ()( )\n()() () ()()()\n22 2 2\n|| || || 1\n1/2\n2\n22 2 2 2 2 2 2 22\n|| 1 || || 1 || || 1\n1,0 1\n2\n   41\ntt p\nt\ntp p t t p\nkk A k\nkk A k k A k\nβε ε β\nε\nεβ β ε ε β\n⎡=+ + + ±⎣\n⎤−+ ++ + + + ⎥\n⎦\n      (29a) \n( )|| ,0 0kβ =    (transmission line modes)        (29b) \nwhere 2\n|| || ||k =k. k . The two solutions associated with (29a) correspond to the E- perturbed \nmodes (“+” sign is chosen in the equation) and to the H-polarized modes (“−” sign is chosen). \nFrom (29a) it is seen that, for on-plane propaga tion, the E-polarized perturbed wave is cut-off \nfor 1pβ β< . The solution (29b) is associated with the transmission line modes, and \ncorresponds to a collapsed band such that 0 β = , independently of ||k . In fact, for very low \nfrequencies the transmission line modes may be nearly independent of ||k  and to a good \napproximation have the Poynting vector along the z-direction. In these conditions, their \ndispersion characteristic is approximately /z tkβ ε≈ , consistently with the properties of \ntransmission line modes in regular wire media [22].  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4 Band Structure for 0.4R a= , 0.05wra = , 0.9p a=  (only the first 3 bands are shown). Solid lines: \nanalytical model; Star symbols: full wave numerical results. X , Γ and Z  are highly symmetric points of the \nBrillouin zone. \n\nIn order to check the accuracy of the proposed analytical model and better understand the \nelectrodynamics of the medium, we have calculated numerically the band structure of the \nmetamaterial using the full wave hybrid-plane-wave-integral-equation method proposed in \n[24]. To simplify the numerical implementation of the numerical method [24], we have \nassumed that the thin wire approximation holds, i.e. that the induced electric current flows \nalong the direction tangent to the helical wires. Apart from this approximation, the full wave \nnumerical results can be considered “exact”. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 we compare the results \nobtained using the analytical model (solid lines) with the full wave band structure results (star \nsymbols). The solid lines were obtained by solving (26) using (22) (eqn. (29) is the \ncorresponding solution for the particular case 0\nzk = ). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5 Same as in Fig. 4 but for 0.4R a= , 0.01wra = , 0.5p a=  (only the first 3 bands are shown). \nIn Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 the dispersion characte ristic of the low-frequency electromagnetic \nmodes is plotted along the segments XΓ (propagation along the x-direction) and \nZΓ (propagation along the z-direction) of the Brillouin zone (BZ) ( k-space). Note that by \ndefinition ( )0, 0, 0Γ= , ,0 ,0X a\nπ⎛⎞=⎜⎟⎝⎠\n and ,0 ,0Z p\nπ⎛⎞=⎜⎟⎜⎟⎝⎠\n. A good agreement between the \n\ntheoretical model and the full wave results is revealed, especially near the Γ point, which \ncorresponds to propagation in the long wavelength limit. \nFor propagation along the XΓ  segment, with ( ),0 ,0xk=k , the solid lines correspond to \nthe solution given by (29). As seen it compares very well with full wave results, even for \nrelatively large values of xk  (i.e. near the X point). Consistently with our initial heuristic \ndiscussion, it is seen in Fig. 4 that for low frequencies ( 1 1.1paaβ β< = ) the E-polarized \nperturbed mode is cut-off because it is strongl y attenuated by the helical wires. As illustrated \nin Fig. 5 when the helix pitch is decreased to 0.5pa=  the cut-off wavenumber 1pβ  of the E-\npolarized perturbed mode also decreases. Simi larly, it can be verified that the cut-off \nfrequency also decreases when the radius of the helix R  increases (not shown). On the other \nhand, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 demonstrate that the dispersion characteristic ()kββ=  of the H-\npolarized perturbed mode is practically linear along the XΓ segment (near the origin of \nBrillouin zone), and has no cut-off for low frequencies. Finally, there is a collapsed band such \nthat 0β = , independently of xk . This band corresponds to transmission line modes, as \ndiscussed before. \nFor propagation along the ZΓ  segment, with ( )0, 0, zk=k , the situation is different. \nIndeed, the analytical model predicts that both the H-polarized and the transmission line \nperturbed modes are degenerate along z, and thus should propagate with the same phase \nvelocity, independent of frequency (the corresponding dispersion characteristic is \n( )0, 0, /z ztkkβ ε≈ ). This prediction is supported by the full wave results, but only for \nrelatively low frequencies (roughly, 0.8aβ < in both figures). For higher frequencies, the full \nwave results demonstrate that the analytical model is not accurate since the dispersion \ncharacteristics of the two modes become clearly distinct. Moreover the modes may enter cut-\noff due to the emergence of electromagnetic band-gaps. \nWe have also characterized the polarization of the E- and H-perturbed modes, assuming \npropagation along the x-direction. Simple calculations demonstrate that (27) predicts that the \npolarization of the fields is proportional to: \n()\n22 2\n11 22\nav 22 2ˆˆpp x\nx xy t x z\nkkj A k A k ββ εββ β\n⎛⎞\n=+ − − ⎜⎟⎜⎟⎝⎠\nEu u ,  0yzkk ==       (30) \nThe above formula is valid for both the E- and H-polarized perturbed modes (of course, \nfrom (29a) it is clear that for each family of modes the relation between β  and xk  is \ndifferent). This result confirms that provided xk  is a real number (i.e. for propagating modes) \nthe wave is transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wi th elliptic polarization, being the principal \naxes of the polarization ellipse along the y- and z-directions. Moreover, it can be easily proven \nthat the H-perturbed mode has left-handed polarization if the helices are right-handed ( 0p > , \nor equivalently 0A > ), and has right-handed polarization if the helices are left-handed \n( 0p < ). Conversely, the polarization of E-pertur bed mode has the same handiness as the \nhelices (provided it is a propagating mode with xk  a real number). Thus, the E- and H- \npolarized perturbed modes rotate in opposite di rections. Finally, we note that when the E-\npolarized perturbed mode is cut-off ( 1pβ β< ) the polarization of the corresponding wave is \nlinear. \nIn order to validate the previous results we have numerically calculated the polarization of \nthe electromagnetic modes using the full wave numerical method [24]. To this end, the \nelectromagnetic modes are obtained numerically and the electric field is then averaged over \nthe unit cell. The comparison between the full wave results (discrete symbols) and (30) (solid \nlines) is depicted in Fig. 6, where we plot the axis ratio of the polarization ellipse as a function \nof the normalized frequency for different metamaterial configurations. It is seen that the \ngeneral agreement is good, even though the helices are closely packed (\n0.4R a= ) and the \nhelix pitch can be as small as 0.2pa=  (curve c). Note that we defined the axis ratio (AR) of \nthe polarization ellipse as the ratio between the minor axis of the ellipse and the major axis of \nthe ellipse, and so 1AR ≤  (in many textbooks AR  is defined as the inverse of this quantity). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 6 Axis ratio of the E-polarized and H-polarized electromagnetic modes as function of the normalized \nfrequency (propagation along the x-direction is implicit). Solid lines: Analytical model; Diamond/Triangle/Star \nsymbols: Full wave results. The radius of the helices is 0.4R a= . The wire radius and the helix pitch are: a) \n0.05wra = , 0.9pa= ; b) 0.01wra = , 0.5pa= ; c) 0.01wra = , 0.2pa= . \nFrom Fig. 6 it is apparent that the AR for the H-polarized perturbed mode is maximal near the \nplasma frequency where the E-polarized perturbed mode starts propagating, 1pβ β≈ ; note \nthat by decreasing the pitch p  the value of 1pβ  also decreases. The results of Fig. 6 suggest \nthat by properly designing the inclusions it ma y be possible to design a screen made of long \nmetallic helices such that at some frequency the E-polarized perturbed mode is cut-off, \nwhereas the H-polarized perturbed mode pr opagates with circular polarization ( AR =1). This \nmay be possible if the magnetoelectric coupling is  very strong, and thus if the radius of the \nhelices R is large. In such conditions, if a linearly polarized plane wave impinges on a \nmetamaterial screen (with polarization in the xoy plane) it will excite an eigenmode in the \nmetamaterial (desirably) characterized by circ ular polarization. This suggests the possibility \n\nof designing a linear to circular polarization conversion screen. This opportunity will be \ninvestigated next.  \nV. POLARIZATION TRANSFORMERS \nIn what follows we study the possibility of the exploiting the magnetoelectric coupling \nintrinsic of the helical inclusions to design linear to circular polarization transformers. We \nexplain how to the derived homogenization model can be used to characterize the scattering \nof plane waves by a finite slab of the metamaterial, and how the helices can be properly \ndesigned, and the thickness of the metamaterial screen tuned, in order that an incoming wave \nwith linear polarization is transformed into a wave with circular polarization. To begin with, \nwe will study with more detail the properties of the electromagnetic modes supported by the \nartificial medium. \nA.\n Propagation along the x-direction \n \nIn order to characterize the fields scattered from a slab of the artificial material formed by \nthe metallic helices, next we study the properties of its electromagnetic modes with further \ndetail for the case of propagation along the x-direction, i.e. with 0yzkk = = .  For a given \n(normalized) frequency / cβ ω= , the E- and H-polarized perturbed modes propagate along \nthe x-direction with propagation constant E\nxk  and H\nxk , respectively. These propagation \nconstants can be calculated by solving (26) with respect to xk  (or equivalently by solving \n(29a) with respect to xk ).

Scattering Problem \nHere we explain how the analytical model can be used to characterize the scattering of \nplane waves by a finite slab of the metamaterial. The slab is infinite and periodic along the y-\ndirection (the lattice constant is a), and has LN  layers of helices arranged along the x-\ndirection. Thus the equivalent thickness of the slab is LLN a= . The geometry for the case \n2LN =  is depicted in the inset of Fig. 7. The interfaces with free-space are taken equal to \n0x =  and x L= . Thus, the helices are centered at ( )/2 , ,0an a m a+ , with m integer and \nn=0,1,… 1 LN − . \nWe assume that the incident wave propagates along the x-direction (normal incidence) and \nis polarized along the y-direction, ˆ\ninc\nxjk xinc inc\nyEe −=Eu , where inc\nxk β≡  is the propagation \nconstant of the incoming wave. The total electromagnetic fields for 0x <  are given by: \n( )ˆˆ ˆ\ninc inc\nxxjk x jk xinc inc\nyc o y c r zEe E e ρρ−+=+ +Eu u u     ( 3 5 a )  \n( )0 ˆˆ ˆ\ninc inc\nxxjk x jk xinc inc\nzc r y c o zEe E eηρ ρ −+=+ −Hu u u ,  0x <   (35b) \nwhere coρ  is the reflection coefficient for the co-polarized wave, and crρ  is the reflection \ncoefficient for the cross-polarized wave. Similarly, for x L> , the transmitted fields are of the \nform, \n() ˆˆ\ninc\nxjk xinc\nco y cr zEt t e −=+Eu u        ( 3 6 a )  \n()0 ˆˆ\ninc\nxjk xinc\ncr y co zEt teη −=− +Hu u ,    x L>   (36b) \nwhere cot  is the transmission coefficient for the co-polarized wave, and crt  is the transmission \ncoefficient for the cross-polarized wave. \nOn the other hand, inside the metamaterial slab, 0 x L< < , we can write the fields in \nterms of E- and H-polarized perturbed modes predicted by our homogenization model. Note \nthat the transmission line modes cannot be excited for normal incidence. Hence, we have the \nfollowing expansions: \n() ( ) ( ) ( )av av av av\nEE H H\nxx x xjk x jk x jk x jk xEE H H\nEx E x Hx H xck e c k e ck e c k e−+ − ++− + −=+ − ++ −EE E E E   \n     ( 3 7 a )  \n() ( ) ( )( )av av av av\nEE H H\nxx x xjk x jk x jk x jk xEE H H\nEx E x Hx H xck e c k e ck e c k e−+ − ++− + −=+ − ++ −HH H H H , \n    (37b) \nwhere ()av xkE , () ,E H\nxk , and ()av xkH  are defined by (30), (31), and (34), respectively, and \n,E Hc±  are the unknown amplitudes of the excited modes. \nIn order to determine the reflection coefficients coρ  and crρ , the transmission coefficients \ncot  and crt , and the four coefficients ,E Hc± , we need to impose that the tangential \nelectromagnetic fields ( yE , zE , yH , zH ) are continuous at the interfaces 0x =  and x L= . In \nthis way, we obtain an 8 ×8 linear system that can be solved numerically with respect to the \nunknowns. The results of the numerical simulations are described in section V.C. \nC. Design of polarization transformers \nIn what follows we prove that it may be possible to take advantage of strong \nmagnetoelectric coupling of the artificial medium  to design polarization conversion screens. \nAs it is manifest from (37), when an incoming wave illuminates a metamaterial screen it may \nexcite both the E- and H- polarized perturbe d modes. As discussed in section IV, the H-\nperturbed wave has elliptical polarization, and the E-perturbed wave has either linear \npolarization (\n1pβ β< , when the mode is attenuated due to the interaction with the helices) or \nelliptical polarization ( 1pβ β> , above the plasma frequency). Our intuition is that for \n1pβ β< , when the E-perturbed mode is cut-off, an incoming wave (with electric field in the \nxoy plane) will couple most of its energy to the H-perturbed wave, and consequently the \nmetamaterial screen may behave as a very e fficient polarization transformer. As discussed \nbefore, it is seen in Fig. 6 that the polariza tion ellipse of the H-perturbed mode may have an \nAR  relatively close to unity near 1pβ β≈ , which suggests that the polarization of the \ntransmitted wave may be nearly circular. \nIt is important to mention that the characteri zation and design of polarization transformers \nexploiting the anisotropy and chirality of materials was studied in [11, pp. 286]. It was found \nthat for a fixed frequency the maximal change in the ellipticity of a plane wave as it \npropagates in an unbounded anisotropic chiral  material is achieved at a distance \n( )/ HE\nx xL kkπ=−  (in our notations) from a given reference plane [11, pp. 290]. The previous \nformula can be regarded as rough estimation of the required metamaterial thickness (of course \nthis condition alone does not guarantee the desired linear to circular polarization conversion). \nIt implies that to design a thin polarization transformer it is necessary that HE\nx xkk −  is as large \nas possible (the formula assumes that both propa gation constants are real; this may not be the \ncase in our problem). From Fig. 4 (for example) it is seen that HE\nx xkk −  is maximum at the \nplasma frequency 1pβ β= , when 0E\nxk = . This suggests that to design a thin polarization \ntransformer one should operate the metamaterial around the plasma frequency 1pβ β= . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 7 Axis ratio of the transmitted wave as function of the normalized frequency varying the number of layers \nLN  of the metamaterial screen. The radius of the helices is 0.4R a= , the wire radius is 0.05wra = , and the \nhelix pitch is 0.9pa= . The inset shows the geometry of the problem for the case 2LN =  layers. \nTo have a more precise idea of the suggested possibilities we solved numerically the \nscattering problem formulated in section V.B, using the new homogenization model. We \ncomputed the \nAR  of the transmitted wave as a function of frequency for a screen with \n0.4R a= , 0.05wra = , and 0.9pa= . The result is depicted in Fig. 7 for different number of \nlayers of helices LN . We refer that the principal axes of the polarization ellipse of the \ntransmitted waves are not in general aligned with the Cartesian y and z axes. As seen in Fig. 7, \nthe AR  of the transmitted wave depends considerably on the thickness of the screen. This is \nunderstandable because by varying LN  we may enhance or deteriorate the AR  of the \ntransmitted wave due to the interference between the different modes excited in the \nmetamaterial slab. Consistently with our previ ous discussion and the results of Fig. 6, the \npeak of the AR  is attained at 1pβ β≈ , which for this example corresponds to 1 1.1p aβ ≈ . It is \n\nnoticeable that for 3LN =  layers and 1pβ β≈  the axis ratio of the polarization ellipse is \n1AR ≈ , i.e. for these parameters the metamaterial screen behaves, in fact, as a linear to \ncircular polarization transformer. Note that due to the interference between the modes inside \nthe slab, the AR  of the transmitted wave may be much larger than the AR  of the H-polarized \nperturbed mode (Fig. 6). \nIn order to validate the results suggested by Fig. 7 (obtained using homogenization \ntheory), we used the periodic method of moments (MoM) to calculate the AR  of the \ntransmitted wave. The corresponding full wave numerical results (discrete symbols) are \ndepicted in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 superimposed on the analytical model results (solid lines), for \ndifferent metamaterial geometries. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 8 Axis ratio of the transmitted wave as function of the normalized frequency.

Solid lines: Analytical model; \nTriangle/Star symbols: Full wave results. The radius of the helices is 0.4R a=  and the helix pitch is \n0.2p a= . The wire radius, and the number of layers are: a) 0.01wra = , 8LN = ; b) 0.05wra = , 6LN = . \nThe Figures reveal that despite the helices are closely packed ( 0.4Ra= ) and the helix \npitch is as small as 0.2p a=  (Fig. 9), the agreement between the analytical model and the full \nwave results is excellent. In all the examples plotted in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we have chosen the \nminimum value for LN  that ensures that the AR  of the transmitted wave is close to unity at \nsome frequency (in general 1pβ β≈ ). The numerical results demonstrate that the incoming \nlinear wave can indeed be transformed into a ci rcularly polarized wave. Notice that in the \nexamples considered here 0 p >  (the helices are right-handed) and, consequently, the \npolarization of the transmitted wave is left -handed (see the discussion in section IV). \nObviously, when the helices are wounded in the opposite direction so that 0 p < , the \npolarization of the transmitted wave becomes right-handed.  \nFig. 8 and Fig. 9 also demonstrate that by decreasing the helix pitch p, the 1AR =  \ncondition occurs at a smaller normalized frequency (because the normalized plasma frequency \n\n1p aβ  decreases due to the enhanced magnetoelectric coupling). However, the number of \nlayers LN  necessary to reveal the effect increases. \nAn important parameter to characterize the efficiency of the polarization conversion is the \nfraction of transmitted power, given by \n22\n1 co crT ρ ρ=− − , where coρ  is the reflection \ncoefficient for the co-polarized wave, and crρ  is the reflection coefficient for the cross-\npolarized wave (see ( 35)). We calculated T  as a function of the normalized frequency using \nboth the analytical model of section V.B and the periodic method of moments. The results \nassociated with Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 are depicted in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, and confirm the very \ngood agreement between the homogenization results (solid lines) and the full wave results \n(discrete symbols). It is seen that for some of the geometries the transmission efficiency can \nbe nearly 100% at the frequency of interest (in particular this true for curve b in Fig. 10, \nwhich corresponds to 0.01\nwra = , 0.9p a= , 5LN = ). The results of Fig. 11 indicate that the \ntransmission efficiency may deteriorate if the helix pitc h is too small, even though a \ntransmission as high as 70% is still possible at the frequency where 1AR ≈ . In any case, the \nresults presented here clearly demonstrate the po tentials of the proposed metamaterial screens \nas polarization transformers, and prove their robustness both in terms of frequency response \nand transmission efficiency. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 10 Fraction of the transmitted power as a function of the normalized frequency.

CONCLUSION \nIn this work, we studied the realization of  polarization transformers using realistic \nmicrostructured materials. To this end, we developed a new homogenization model to \n\ncharacterize a periodic medium formed by long metallic helices. We extracted the effective \npermittivity, permeability and chirality of the metamaterial. We compared the proposed \nanalytical model with full wave band structure simulations showing good agreement, even for \ndemanding cases in which the helices are densely packed and the pitch is relatively small. We \napplied the results to the design of novel polarization transformers. It was shown that the \nproposed metamaterial may act effectively as a linear-to-circular polarization transformer, \nwith low reflection loss, good bandwidth, and yielding a transmitted wave with axis ratio very \nclose to one. The theoretical results are supported by full wave simulations.  \nAPPENDIX A \n \nHere, we present the details about the mathematical model of the helices. The \nparameterization of the surface of a generic helix is: \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )0,c o s s i n wuu r u uφφ φ=+ +rr N B ,  πφ 20 <<   (A1) \nwhere wr  is the wire radius, ( )0 ur  is a parameterization of the helix axis given by (1), and N \nand B are the associated normal and binormal vectors [25]. The tangent vector is 00 rrT ′′= . \nThe Frenet-Serret formulas state that [25]: \n0\n00\n0\n00\nK\nK τ\nτ\n′⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛⎞\n⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜⎟′′ =−⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜⎟⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜⎟′ −⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝⎠\nTT\nNr N\nBB\n       ( A 2 )  \nwhere K  is the curvature and τ  is the torsion of the curve.

The approximation (11) is used, \nand to keep the notation short we define ( ) ( ) ( )\n00\nˆ j\npp e\n′+ −′′Φ= Φ\nk. r r\nrr rr . \nProperty 1:            \n( ) ( )00ppK uu K u u′′ =         ( B 1 )  \nThis property is a consequence of ( ) ( )00\nˆˆ\npp ′ ′Φ= Φrr r r . \nProperty 2:             \nLet us suppose that the wire parameterisation satisfies ( ) ( )00 uT u+ =+rr a   for arbitrary u, \nwhere a  is a primitive vector of the lattice (eventually zero) and T is a constant. Then,  \n() () ( )00 0pp pK u uK u T uK u u T′′ ′=+ = +      ( B 2 )  \nIn fact, ( ) ( )00 uT u+= +rr a  implies that ( ) ( ),,uT u φφ+ =+rr a , and since \n() ( )00\nˆˆ\nppΦ= Φ +rr a  the property is obvious. \nProperty 3:             \nLet R  be a rotation by 90º in the horizontal plane: ( ) ( )zxyzyxR ,,,,: −→ . Suppose that the \nwire parameterisation satisfies ( ) ( )00 0uu R u+ =+r. r v   for arbitrary u, where v is a constant \nvector. We also consider that the lattice is orthogonal and that the transversal lattice is a \nsquare lattice. In that case, we have that:   \n() ()00 0 0ppK uu K u u u u′′ =+ +       ( B 3 )  \nIn fact, ( ) ( )00 0uu R u+= +r. r v  implies that ( ) ( )0 ,,uu R uφφ+ =+r. r v . Due to the lattice \nsymmetry we also have that ( ) ( )00\nˆˆ\npp RΦ= Φr. r  (i.e. ( ) ( )00\nˆˆ\npp RR′′Φ =Φ + +rr . r v . r v ). \nUsing the previous formulas we readily obtain the desired result. \nProperty 4:             \nLet τ  be a reflection relatively to one of the coordinate axis (e.g. ( )( ) zyxzyxx ,,,,: −→τ ). \nLet us suppose that the wire axis satisfies ( ) ( )00 uu τ−= −r. r  for arbitrary u, and that the \nlattice is orthogonal. In that case we have that:    \n() ()00ppK uu K u u′′ =− −        ( B 4 )  \nIndeed, ( ) ( )00 uu τ−= −r. r  implies that ( ) ( ),,uu φ τφ−−= −r. r . Since the lattice is orthogonal \nwe also have that () ( )00\nˆˆ\npp τΦ= Φ −r. r . Substituting these formulas into (16) we readily \nobtain (B4). \n \nAPPENDIX C \n \nHere we prove some useful properties of the integrals given by (17). To begin with, we \nprove that:  \n() ()()0 cos sin 0pdudu K u u mu nu\nππ\nππ−−\n′′ ′ =∫∫      ( C 1 )  \nIndeed, since the helix satisfies ( ) ( )00 xuu τ−= −r. r , we can apply property (B4) and after \nchanging the integration variables we easily obta in (C1). Note that because of (B1) we can \ninterchange the roles of “sin” and “cos” in the above expression. \nOn the other hand, we have that, \n()\n() ()\n00\n0\n22\n                                             =\njmu jnu jmu jnu\npp\nmn jmu jnu\np\ndudu K u u e e dudu K u u e e\nj dudu K u u e e\nππ ππ\nππ ππ\nππ\nππ\nππ′ ′\n−− −−\n+ ′\n−−\n⎛⎞′′ ′ ′ =+ + ⎜⎟⎝⎠\n′′−\n∫∫ ∫∫\n∫∫\n  (C2) \nwhere the first identity is a consequence of (B3) with 0 2u π= , and the second identity is a \nconsequence of (B2) and of the fact th at the integrations are over one period 2T π= . From \nthe previous result it is obvious that: \n()0 0jmu jnu\npdudu K u u e e\nππ\nππ\n′\n−−\n′′ =∫∫  if  mn+  is not multiple of 4   (C3) \nIn particular, extracting the real part of the above expression and using the fact that \n()0pK uu ′  is real, it follows that (assuming from now on that if  mn+  is not multiple of 4): \n() ()() () ()()00 cos cos sin sinppdudu K u u mu nu dudu K u u mu nu\nππ ππ\nππ ππ−− −−\n′′ ′ ′′ ′ =∫∫ ∫∫  (C4) \nPutting 1mn== , we find that, 11\n~CC = . On the other hand, replacing n by –n i n (C 4) a nd \nsumming term by term the resulting identity with (C4), we obtain that: \n() ()() () ()()00 cos cos sin sin 0ppdudu K u u mu nu dudu K u u mu nu\nππ ππ\nππ ππ−− −−\n′′ ′ ′′ ′ = =∫∫ ∫∫   (C5) \nwhen both mn+  and mn−  are not multiples of 4.
