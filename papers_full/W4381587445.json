  "abstract": "This paper studies recent developments in large language models' (LLM)\\nabilities to pass assessments in introductory and intermediate Python\\nprogramming courses at the postsecondary level. The emergence of ChatGPT\\nresulted in heated debates of its potential uses (e.g., exercise generation,\\ncode explanation) as well as misuses in programming classes (e.g., cheating).\\nRecent studies show that while the technology performs surprisingly well on\\ndiverse sets of assessment instruments employed in typical programming classes\\nthe performance is usually not sufficient to pass the courses. The release of\\nGPT-4 largely emphasized notable improvements in the capabilities related to\\nhandling assessments originally designed for human test-takers. This study is\\nthe necessary analysis in the context of this ongoing transition towards mature\\ngenerative AI systems. Specifically, we report the performance of GPT-4,\\ncomparing it to the previous generations of GPT models, on three Python courses\\nwith assessments ranging from simple multiple-choice questions (no code\\ninvolved) to complex programming projects with code bases distributed into\\nmultiple files (599 exercises overall). Additionally, we analyze the\\nassessments that were not handled well by GPT-4 to understand the current\\nlimitations of the model, as well as its capabilities to leverage feedback\\nprovided by an auto-grader. We found that the GPT models evolved from\\ncompletely failing the typical programming class' assessments (the original\\nGPT-3) to confidently passing the courses with no human involvement (GPT-4).\\nWhile we identified certain limitations in GPT-4's handling of MCQs and coding\\nexercises, the rate of improvement across the recent generations of GPT models\\nstrongly suggests their potential to handle almost any type of assessment\\nwidely used in higher education programming courses. These findings could be\\nleveraged by educators and institutions to adapt the design of programming\\nassessments as well as to fuel the necessary discussions into how programming\\nclasses should be updated to reflect the recent technological developments.\\nThis study provides evidence that programming instructors need to prepare for a\\nworld in which there is an easy-to-use widely accessible technology that can be\\nutilized by learners to collect passing scores, with no effort whatsoever, on\\nwhat today counts as viable programming knowledge and skills assessments.\\n",
