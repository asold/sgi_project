    "abstract": "Computational vaccinology includes epitope mapping, antigen selection, and immunogen design using computational tools. Tools that facilitate the <i>in silico</i> prediction of immune response to biothreats, emerging infectious diseases, and cancers can accelerate the design of novel and next generation vaccines and their delivery to the clinic. Over the past 20 years, vaccinologists, bioinformatics experts, and advanced programmers based in Providence, Rhode Island, USA have advanced the development of an integrated toolkit for vaccine design called iVAX, that is secure and user-accessible by internet. This integrated set of immunoinformatic tools comprises algorithms for scoring and triaging candidate antigens, selecting immunogenic and conserved T cell epitopes, re-engineering or eliminating regulatory T cell epitopes, and re-designing antigens to induce immunogenicity and protection against disease for humans and livestock. Commercial and academic applications of iVAX have included identifying immunogenic T cell epitopes in the development of a T-cell based human multi-epitope Q fever vaccine, designing novel influenza vaccines, identifying cross-conserved T cell epitopes for a malaria vaccine, and analyzing immune responses in clinical vaccine studies. Animal vaccine applications to date have included viral infections of pigs such as swine influenza A, PCV2, and African Swine Fever. \"Rapid-Fire\" applications for biodefense have included a demonstration project for Lassa Fever and Q fever.

Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the past 20 years, academic researchers and commercial\ncompanies have developed immunoinformatics tools to discove r\nthe T cell epitope “triggers” that activate the immune system\nand have applied these tools to vaccine design. The pace of\nalgorithm development for discovering epitopes and designing\nvaccines has recently accelerated, due to renewed interest\nin epitope-based vaccines generated by the introduction of\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors to the ﬁeld of oncology (\n1)\nand the emergence of new pathogens such as nCOV-2019\n(SARS-CoV-2).\nThis review will describe vaccine design tools developed\nby the authors and their application to epitope discovery,\nantigen engineering, and immunology research in wide-\nranging collaborations, as illustrated in several case stu dies.\nStarting with T cell epitope discovery, we illustrate how T\ncell epitopes are relevant to vaccine safety, eﬃcacy, antigen\ncharacterization, antigen engineering, and vaccine desig n.\nWe believe that T cell epitopes deserve greater focus in\nvaccine development, because even in the absence of eﬀective\nantibody response, T cell epitopes are important drivers of\nimmune defense against pathogens and may also facilitate thei r\nescape from immune defense. Speciﬁcally, new information\non cross-conservation between pathogen T cell epitopes\nand the human genome (and microbiome) is emerging,\nand has important implications for vaccine design. For\nexample, “memory” of cross-conserved T cell epitopes has been\ndeﬁned as a key contributor to the strength of protection\ngenerated by vaccines (\n2–4). These discoveries are coming\nto light through the application of new tools that examine\nT cell epitopes and their role in vaccines, using the power\nof immunoinformatics.\nOne of the newest tools described here addresses the concept\nof immune camouﬂage ( Figure 1). Beginning in 2013, we\nobserved that the TCR face of epitopes presented by some\npathogens contains patterns of amino acids that are identical to\nT cell epitopes that bind to the same HLA alleles and are highly\nprevalent in the human proteome (\n5, 6). We hypothesized that\nthe role of these “human-like” T cell epitopes may be to tolerize\nagainst a pathogen, by activating self-reactive Tregs that s uppress\nimmune response (\n7). We also observed that immune camouﬂage\nis more likely to be present in pathogens that have the capacity\nto modify antigens (\n8, 9). We have generated evidence that this\nconcept is also relevant to cancer vaccines and could improve t he\nsafety and eﬃcacy of such vaccines ( 10).\nAfter validating the immune camouﬂage hypothesis in\nretrospective ( 5) and prospective studies ( 4–10), we developed\na new tool for iV AX called JanusMatrix that triages human-\nlike epitopes from others. We highlighted the important\nrole of human-like T cell epitopes in the abrogation of\neﬀective vaccine response. Furthermore, we used a tool\ncalled OptiMatrix to design immune-engineered vaccines\nthat enhance immunogenicity by removing human-like\nepitopes (\n11). In other iV AX toolkit advances, to be described\nhere, we explored the HLA-restricted or “personal” nature\nof immune response to novel antigens and developed\nFIGURE 1 | Immune camouﬂage. T cell epitopes found in the sequences of\nviruses, bacteria, and parasites and/or in the human microbi ome may be\nconserved with highly prevalent T cell epitopes found in sel f-proteins from the\nhuman genome; cross-conservation may be observed at the TCR face for\npeptides that bind to the same HLA but do not have identical se quences. This\nmay enable a pathogen to trigger “ignorance” or active toler ance from T cells\nthat have been trained on self-epitopes. Adapted from Moise et al. ( 5).\nspeciﬁc tools to address these types of evaluations, called\niTEM (individualized T cell epitope measure) and EpiCC\n(epitope content comparison), respectively. In the sections\nto follow, we will describe the newest iV AX tools, illustrate\nthe application of the tools to current vaccine development\nprograms, and highlight recent collaborations related to\nthe development of vaccines against a range of human and\nanimal pathogens.\nMETHODS: NEW IMMUNOINFORMATICS\nTOOLS AND THE iVAX TOOLKIT\nComputational vaccine design, also known as computational\nvaccinology, encompasses epitope mapping, antigen selection,\nand immunogen design using computational tools. In silico\nprediction of immune response to emerging infectious diseases\nand cancers can accelerate the design of novel and next\ngeneration vaccines. The iV AX toolkit is an integrated set o f\nimmunoinformatics algorithms that has been in development\nsince 1998. It comprises a suite of immunoinformatics algori thms\nfor triaging candidate antigens, selecting immunogenic an d\nconserved T cell epitopes, eliminating potential regulatory T\ncell epitopes, and optimizing antigens for immunogenicity and\nprotection against disease. While aspects of the toolkit have\nbeen published [see (\n12–14)], as of 2015, the iV AX toolkit has\nbeen signiﬁcantly upgraded, new tools have been integrated\nand validations of the new tools have been published. Here we\nwill focus the newest tools and provide illustrated examples of\niV AX applications.\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al. Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\nOverview of the iVAX Toolkit\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, iV AX incorporates a large number of\ntools that can be used sequentially or individually to manipul ate\ninformation derived from the core T cell epitope mapping tool,\nEpiMatrix (\n15). Tools such as the Conservatrix, EpiMatrix,\nClustiMer, and EpiAssembler algorithms have been described\nin great detail previously ( 14). Newer tools include the VaxCAD\nalgorithm ( 16) that creates string-of-beads vaccine designs while\nminimizing deleterious junctional epitopes that may be creat ed\nin the process of linking one epitope to another. Additional too ls\nthat have been integrated into the website since 2015 includ e\nJanusMatrix, a specially tailored homology analysis tool that\nexamines pathogen/host sequence similarity at the MHC:TCR\ninterface for any given peptide, and predicts potentially cross -\nconserved epitopes, allowing candidate sequences with potent ial\nhost cross-conservation (at the TCR face) to be preferentiall y\nexcluded from vaccine constructs, and iTEM, which enables the\nanalysis of an individual’s immune responses to vaccine anti gens\naccording to their HLA haplotype. The latter two tools have als o\nbeen integrated into a separate pipeline for personalized cancer\nvaccine design called Ancer, that has been licensed to EpiVax\nOncology, an investor-backed spin out of EpiVax.\nAssessing Protein Antigens for\nImmunogenic Potential Using EpiMatrix\nEvery vaccine design project begins with an analysis for T cell\nepitope content. This search for class I HLA ligands or class\nII HLA ligands (and putative epitopes) is performed using\nEpiMatrix (\n15). Antigen sequences obtained from databases such\nas GenBank or UniProt are input in FASTA format. In theory,\nthere is no need to limit to the number of input sequences,\nand entire host genomes (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\nBurkholderia mallei and pseudomallei, and Coxiella burnet ii)\nhave in fact been analyzed (\n17, 18).\nTo perform an EpiMatrix epitope-mapping analysis, each\ninput sequence is ﬁrst parsed into overlapping 9-mer frames\n(and 10-mer frames for Class I). Parsed 9- and 10-mers are\nthen evaluated for patterns that match known HLA-binding\npreferences for a panel of nine common “supertype” Class II HLA\nalleles or six Class I supertypes alleles using EpiMatrix (\n19). These\nalleles are selected both because they are relatively commo n\nwithin the human population, and relatively distinct from each\nother, and, each supertype has HLA binding preferences that\nare functionally equivalent to, or nearly equivalent to, ma ny\nadditional family member alleles. Taken collectively, the nine\nHLA Class II supertype alleles, along with their respective\nfamily members, cover well-over 95% of most HLA types\npresent in human population groups (\n20), and the six supertype\nalleles, along with their respective family members, cover o ver\n98% of the human population groups including East Asian\npopulations (\n21).\nEven though antigen analysis is generally performed at\nthe population level, there are many instances when a more\nprecise HLA-by-HLA analysis may be required. Over the past\nFIGURE 2 | Tools comprised in the iVAX Toolkit and laboratory tools use d in validation studies. The iVAX toolkit is an on-line, secu re access toolkit that provides\nindividualized sites for academic and commercial users. Se quences can be uploaded and analyzed for Class I and Class II T c ell epitopes using EpiMatrix and\nsearched for clusters of epitopes (promiscuous epitopes) u sing ClustiMer. Tools such as Conservatrix deﬁne cross-stra in conserved epitopes and JanusMatrix\nidentiﬁes T cell epitopes that induce anergy or active tolera nce. These algorithms, and others such as VaxCAD and iTEM are integrated into the secure-access,\ncloud-based toolkit. Beyond the in silico analysis phase, vaccine design usually proceeds to in vitro and in vivo validation.\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al. Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\n5 years, EpiMatrix has been updated to include many more\nHLA alleles than the standard six Class I “supertypes” and Class\nII “archetypes” (2,217 Class I and 612 Class II alleles are now\navailable) as well as murine (H-2K, H-2D, I-A, and I-E haplotype s\nfor Balb/C and C57Bl/6) and epitope prediction for swine SLA\nalleles (\n22) (15 Class I and 8 Class II alleles are now available).\nThis capacity to evaluate for a set of HLA enables personalized\npredictions, making the toolkit useful for evaluating indiv idual\nsubject responses to vaccine antigens, or for exploring HLA-\nspeciﬁc vulnerabilities to pathogen escape.\nThe data used to generate EpiMatrix matrix-based predictors\nhas been described previously (\n15). Sources for the development\nof the tools include the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB),\nwhere, for example, 25,764 unique T cell epitopes, HLA ligands,\nand eluted peptides have been collected for the human HLA\nA∗0101 allele. Each of the more than 39 class I matrices and\n42 class II matrices are based on similarly large datasets. F rom\nthis starting point, we apply internal algorithms for cleaning the\ndatabase to downselect the ﬁnal list of epitopes that inform ou r\nmatrices. Careful curation of high-quality binders and rem oval\nof low-quality binders enables EpiMatrix to perform better (o n\naverage) than other tools, as illustrated in a recent head-t o-head\ncomparisons of published HLA class I ligands ( Figure 3).\nFigure 3A shows a recent comparison of EpiMatrix score of\neluted peptides to those generated by other publicly available\ntools (NetMHCpan) that was made possible by the publication of\na large set of eluted peptides (\n23). Figure 3B shows recent HLA\nbinding studies for HLA class II-restricted epitopes, perform ed\nat EpiVax (published and unpublished). Additional T cell epitope\nand HLA binding validation studies have been published in the\ncourse of grant-funded research collaborations, describi ng T cell\nimmune responses to predicted epitopes in vitro using human\nlymphocytes [see (\n4, 24–32)] and also in prospective, in vivo\nimmunogenicity and vaccine eﬃcacy studies in murine models\n[see (\n10, 18, 33–38)].\nScaling Antigens for Their Potential for\nImmunogenicity\nT Cell Epitope Content\nIn order to select antigens for vaccine design, it is importan t\nto consider the overall potential for immunogenicity, which\nis directly related to cytotoxic T cell (CTL) or T helper (Th)\nT cell epitope content. Even though the eﬀect of adjuvants\nand the innate immune system is critically important for\nimmunogenicity, these “danger signals” are unlikely to be\neﬀective if there are no T cell epitopes for the activated immune\nsystem to react to. Thus, we have hypothesized that the greate r\nthe concentration of HLA ligands and putative T cell epitopes\nthat are contained in an antigen, the more likely it will induc e an\nimmune response.\nThis hypothesis has generally been supported in prospective\nstudies, with the caveat that correction of the total T cell epi tope\ncount for the presence of Treg epitopes is likely to be important,\nbut methods for performing that analysis on a large scale have\nnot yet been extensively validated in prospective studies, and\nthresholds for cross-conservation have not been extensive ly\ntested (for whole antigens), and thus our group prefers to eva luate\nantigens for putative Treg epitopes on a case-by-case basis.\nProtein Immunogenicity Scale\nT cell epitope concentration can be expressed as an overall\nEpiMatrix score called the EpiMatrix Protein Score , which is\nthe diﬀerence between the number of predicted T cell epitopes\nexpected in a random protein sequence and the number of\nputative epitopes predicted by the EpiMatrix System in a given\nprotein, normalized for length (per 1,000 amino acids). With th e\nFIGURE 3 | Recent validation studies: (A) CD8 T cell epitopes. Retrospective analysis of eluted pepti de dataset published by Abelin et al. ( 23) 95% of eluted 9- and\n10-mers are predicted to bind to HLA according to EpiMatrix, many of which are predicted strong binders (solid bars). Onl y ∼ 88% of ligands were accurately recalled\nby various versions of NetMHCpan. EpiMatrix also identiﬁes t he majority of the eluted ligands as high afﬁnity binders (85% of all eluted peptides, solid bars), whereas\nonly up to 58% of ligands were identiﬁed as high afﬁnity binders (IC50 ≤ 50 nM) by NetMHCpan.

Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\naverage number of T cell epitopes contained in 10,000 randomly\ngenerated protein sequences set to zero, highly immunogenic\nvaccine antigens score higher than 20 on this normalized scal e.\nComparing Antigens to the Human\nProteins\nHuman proteins generally score lower than the randomly\ngenerated proteins on this scale. In a recently performed\nassessment of the class II HLA DR T cell epitope content of\nhuman proteins (\n39), the median score of the entire human\nproteome was found to be − 9.05, suggesting that T cell epitopes,\nwhich could support deleterious autoimmune activity, tend to be\npresent in lower than expected numbers. The median score of\nsecreted proteins is even lower, − 23.08, suggesting that proteins\nwith a greater likelihood of uptake and presentation by APCs ar e\nfurther deimmunized.\nIn other words, it may be evolutionarily advantageous for\nthe human proteome to be “deimmunized” with respect to T\ncell epitope content (as shown in blue, in Figure 4). We ﬁrst\ndescribed this concept in 2006, when we proposed that it may\nhave been advantageous for self-proteins to be “deimmunized ”\nto reduce the likelihood of auto-reactivity (\n40). A similar\nFIGURE 4 | EpiMatrix immunogenicity scale, showing vaccine antigens ,\nhuman proteins that have been reported to be immunogenic, an d\nnon-immunogenic antigens alongside the median scores for s ets of proteins\nfrom the human genome. The vaccine antigen sequences were ob tained from\nUniProt. The EpiMatrix immunogenicity scale is set to zero b ased on the\nmedian HLA DR score of a set of random protein sequences. Norm alization of\nthe HLA scoring enables direct comparison of median HLA DR sc ores to\ncandidate antigens; for example, candidate vaccine antige n A would be\npreferred over candidate vaccine antigen B for inclusion in a vaccine designed\nto elicit T helper immune response and to drive humoral respo nse.\npropensity has been observed for some, but not all human\npathogens (\n8, 9).\nRegional Immunogenicity\nThe normalized EpiMatrix Protein Score of a given protein\nis a good proxy for immunogenicity, however, regional\nimmunogenicity can also determine the immunogenic potentia l\nof a protein. T cell epitopes have been observed to cluster\nin regions of protein sequences. T cell epitope “clusters” are\ndeﬁned using ClustiMer, a cluster-ﬁnding algorithm in iV AX.\nClusters can range from nine to roughly 25 amino acids in\nlength and can contain anywhere from four to forty HLA bindin g\nmotifs. T cell epitope clusters scoring above 10 are considered\nto have signiﬁcant immunogenic potential. Some T cell epitope\nclusters contain a single 9-mer frame that may contain sequen ces\nthat can bind to at least four diﬀerent HLA alleles. iV AX\ndenotes this feature as an “EpiBar” for its bar-like appearance in\nEpiMatrix reports.\nPeptides containing promiscuously binding epitopes such as\nEpiBars can be very powerful immunogens. Examples include\nthe well-known T cell epitopes used as controls for T cell assays\n(\n41), including Inﬂuenza Hemagglutinin 306–318 ( Figure 5),\nTetanus Toxin 825–850 and GAD65 557–567. We have observed\nthat 100% of subjects exposed to either Tularemia or Vaccinia\nrespond to T cell epitope pools containing between 20 and 50\npromiscuous epitopes (\n25, 26).\nClusters are also important features of self-proteins and\nare often involved in auto-reactive T cell responses. Well-\nknown “auto-epitopes” such as insulin peptide C23-A2\n(LQPLALEGSLQKRGI) contain signiﬁcant numbers of HLA\nDR binding motifs (\n42). To better deﬁne immunogenic epitopes,\nwe have determined that an EpiMatrix Cluster score cut oﬀ\nof 10 (roughly deﬁned as the number of signiﬁcant HLA\nbinding “hits” divided by sequence length) is a feature of hi ghly\nimmunogenic clusters.\nAlso in contrast with the general trend toward\n“deimmunization” observed for most of the proteins in the\nhuman genome, we found that Complement Factor 3 subunit\nD (C3d) has a higher concentration of T cell epitopes, which\nsuggests that it may perform the important function of\nproviding non-cognate help to drive humoral immune response\nwhen it binds to antigen and is taken up by B cells. This\npeptide is located in the previously deﬁned P28 “adjuvant”\nregion of C3d which is completely conserved across species\n(\n43, 44). Mutation of a single T-cell epitope in P28 resulted\nin signiﬁcantly diminished adjuvant activity of the peptide\nin mice (\n45), which supports the hypothesis that the epitope\nactivates autoreactive T-helper cells so as to bridge innate an d\nadaptive immunity.\nJanusMatrix and Human-Like T Cell\nEpitopes\nAlthough T cells possessing anti-self TCRs were previously\nthought likely to be eliminated in the thymus, evidence emer ged\nshowing that anti-self-immune response is also controlled by\nregulatory T cells recognizing the same antigens (\n46, 47). The\nphenotype of these regulatory T cells may be reinforced by\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al.

This analysis of an inﬂuenza hema gglutinin sequence shows a 9-mer frame that contains 7 top 1% hits and 2 top 5% hits for\nHLA DR alleles. This feature is called an EpiBar (Epitope bar ) and is a feature of highly immunogenic epitopes. This analy sis was performed using HLA DRB1 alleles.\nrepetitive re-exposure to their cognate self-antigens ( 48). Thus,\nhuman immune response to new antigens is shaped by previous\nexperience in the thymus and by exposure-driven reinforcemen t\nin the course of immune system maturation.\nIn 2013, we observed that critical antigens from human\npathogens contained T cell epitopes that are highly conserved\nwith self-antigens, and postulated that these epitopes might\ninduce “ignorance” or active tolerance to the antigen upon\nvaccination, resulting in “immune camouﬂage” (\n7). In\nretrospective studies, we determined that peptide epitopes that\nhave homologs in the human proteome that have compatible,\nbut not exactly matched, MHC binding anchors and exactly\nmatched TCR-facing contours have the potential to be ignored\n(lack of immune response) or induce active tolerance (activat e\nT cells that are immunosuppressive in bystander assays and/or\nexhibit cell surface markers that are consistent with T cell s\nknown to have a regulatory T cell phenotype). We developed\nthe JanusMatrix tool so as to identify these human-like\nepitopes and have been exploring the impact of modifying\nand excluding these epitopes to improve the antigenicity of\nvaccines (\n49).\nFor any given T cell epitope, JanusMatrix deﬁnes the amino\nacids that contact and bind the MHC molecule, and also identiﬁ es\nthose amino acids that make contact with the TCR of responding\nT cells. For Class II restricted epitopes, positions 1, 4, 6, and 9\nare assumed to make contact with the MHC and positions 2, 3,\n5, 7, and 8 are assumed to be available to the TCR ( Figure 6).\nThe TCR facing residues of Class I epitopes varies from allele\nto allele.\nThe JanusMatrix algorithm then searches a reference databa se\n(which may be human, murine, or other organism), for similar\nepitopes, taking into consideration epitope conservation of th e\nMHC-facing agretope and the TCR-facing epitope. Reference\nsequences with a compatible but perhaps not sequence-identica l\nagretope (i.e., one that is predicted by EpiMatrix to bind the\nsame HLA as the input peptide) and exactly matching the TCR\ncontacts of the input peptide are returned. For a given EpiMatrix\nScore, a high JanusMatrix Homology Score suggests that T cel ls\nFIGURE 6 | JanusMatrix and self-like epitopes. Each HLA ligand has two\nfaces: the HLA-binding face (agretope, blue residues), and the TCR-interacting\nface (epitope, green residues).

We use a cutoﬀ of two (cross-\nconserved HLA-allele-speciﬁc epitopes averaged over the lengt h\nof the sequence) for proteins that are not self, and of three\nfor proteins that are ’self’ , to identify epitopes that are more\nlikely to be tolerated or actively regulatory. This cutoﬀ has been\npublished (\n4).\nIn the ﬁrst prospective test of this tool, we were able to identi fy\nT cell epitopes from hepatitis C virus ( 50) with high JanusMatrix\nScores that induce regulatory T cells in vitro and suppress\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al. Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\nimmune responses to other peptides. Speciﬁcally, JanusMatrix\nidentiﬁed a promiscuous class II epitope in non-structural HCV\nprotein p7 that exhibits homology at the TCR face with hundreds\nof human proteome-derived T cell epitopes and induces an\nincrease in CD4 + CD25+ FoxP3+ Treg number and function in\nPBMC cultures derived from an HLA-diverse cohort of HCV-\ninfected patients.\nAdditionally, we found similar human-like epitopes in\nemerging H7N9 inﬂuenza (\n6, 11). The ability of class II-\nrestricted H7N9 epitopes to activate or modulate eﬀector\nT cell responses was correlated with their degree of cross-\nconservation at the TCR-face with similar epitopes in the\nhuman proteome, as deﬁned by JanusMatrix. These epitopes\nactivate human CD4 + CD25highCD39+ FoxP3+ Tregs and\nsuppress H7N9-speciﬁc eﬀector T cell responses (\n6). Deletion\nof the Treg-inducing epitope in H7N9 HA produced an\nantigenically improved HA that stimulated a 6-fold increase\nin activated, eﬀector CD4 + T cells over wild type H7-HA\nin vitro , and stimulated a 5-fold greater anti-H7-HA IgG\ntiter and 20-fold greater anti-H7-HA B cell frequency over\nmice immunized with wild type protein in humanized mouse\nimmunization (\n11).\nIn the biologics area, we have discovered conserved Treg-\ninducing epitopes (Tregitopes) in immunoglobulin G with TCR-\nface patterns found in several self-proteins. We went on to\ndemonstrate that the Tregitope peptides bind to multiple MHC\nclass II molecules, suppress eﬀector T cell responses to co-\ndelivered antigen, upregulate Treg-associated cytokines a nd\nchemokines, and induce antigen-speciﬁc CD4 + CD25+ FoxP3+\nTregs in vitro and in vivo (\n51, 52). While once considered\nnovel, the idea that natural regulatory T cells can be engage d\nand activated by peptide epitopes possessing TCR-facing motifs\ncommonly found within human proteins is now gaining traction\n(\n53) and concepts that are similar to JanusMatrix have also been\ndescribed by other research groups ( 54, 55).\nPersonalized, or Individualized T Cell\nEpitope Analysis (iTEM and J-iTEM)\nWe also recently determined that T cell epitopes that stimulat e\nCD4 T helper cells in speciﬁc human subjects can be identiﬁed\nby immunoinformatic analysis to predict the antigenicity of\nindividual epitopes or whole proteins, utilizing the patient’s HLA\ntype. To perform this analysis, we focus the prediction on patien t-\nspeciﬁc HLA alleles using the individualized T cell epitope\nmeasure (iTEM) tool (\n56) and correct for cross-conserved\nepitopes presented by the same HLA allele using JanusMatrix.\nThe analysis that results from the combination of these two t ools\nis now called J-iTEM. Case studies using this new combination\nof tools are provided below.\nIntegrating PigMatrix Into iVAX for Animal\nVaccine Development\nWe developed epitope prediction tools for swine and published\nthe method used to develop the tools in 2013 (\n22); these\ntools can now be selected instead of human HLA-epitope\nprediction tools, enabling the entire iV AX toolkit platform\nto be applied to infectious disease aﬀecting swine. This tool\nis currently being applied to the development of a universal\ninﬂuenza vaccine for pigs (\n57), and to prepare a vaccine\nfor the eventual emergence of African Swine Fever (ASF) in\nthe USA. Addressing another important issue that confronts\nhog farmers, we developed an immunoinformatic approach\nthat matches existing vaccines with circulating strains to help\nfarmers pick the best vaccine for their individual pork farm,\nthat might mitigate against disease when vaccine-induced\nantibody does not protect. This tool is called EpiCC (\n58) for\nT Cell Epitope Content Comparison and is under evaluation\nby commercial vaccine companies for applications to a wide\nrange of swine pathogens including PCV2. Higher EpiCC\nscores are thought to be associated with greater vaccine\nprotection against challenge strains, and the ﬁrst study of\nthis method identiﬁed a “threshold of protection” that may\ndetermine whether a vaccine contains suﬃcient T cell epitope\nrelatedness to provide cross-conserved immune protection\nagainst challenge strains.\nRESULTS: RECENT CASE STUDIES USING\niVAX\nDevelopment of CD8 + and CD4 +\nT Cell-Targeted Universal Inﬂuenza\nVaccines\nIn a collaboration with Chris Eickhoﬀ and Dan Hoft at Saint\nLouis University, we identiﬁed CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes\nthat are highly conserved in diverse inﬂuenza A strains that\nwere shown to be immunogenic in humans expressing geneticall y\ndiverse MHC (\n59). Proof-of-principle studies were conducted\nusing novel vaccines incorporating these newly deﬁned T cell\nepitopes in HLA transgenic mouse strains that respond to\nthe same peptide/MHC combinations as human T cells. These\nvaccines elicited robust T cell responses and provided signiﬁc ant\nprotection against diverse inﬂuenza A challenges, providing\nstrong support for T cell-targeting universal inﬂuenza A vacc ines.\nEﬀorts to develop a universal inﬂuenza vaccine are ongoing in\ncollaborations with researchers in the United States (Saint Louis\nUniversity, University of Georgia) and Europe.\nPredicting Immunogenic Coxiella burnetii\nT Helper Epitopes\nBuilding on our experience with the “rapid ﬁre” development\nof a vaccine for Lassa Fever (\n60), EpiMatrix and JanusMatrix\nwere used to identify 50 promiscuous class II epitopes from\nCoxiella burnetii antigens that were tested in HLA binding\nassays and screened for immunogenicity in HLA-DR3 transgeni c\nmice by colleagues at the Vaccines and Immunotherapy Center\n(VIC, Harvard) and Innatoss, Oss, the Netherlands (\n28, 29).\nSigniﬁcant epitope-speciﬁc IFN γ responses were found for 11/50\npeptides, all of which are predicted HLA-DRB1 ∗0301 epitopes\n(Fisher’s exactp-value: 0.023); all but one bound to DRB1 ∗0301\nin vitro . A vaccine featuring these epitopes is in development\nby a consortium based at the Vaccines and Immunotherapy\nCenter (Harvard) and may eventually replace the existing vacc ine\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al. Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\n(QVax) and/or the T cell epitopes may be used to develop\ndiagnostic reagents (\n29).\nOptimized Selection of Plasmodium\nfalciparum Circumsporozoite Protein\nT Helper Epitopes\nHelper CD4 + T cells are central to development of protective\nimmune responses to P. falciparum malaria, playing a key role\nin the B cell activation and maturation process. Working with\nAmy Noe and Vinayaka Kotraiah at Leidos, we used iV AX to\npredict and analyze HLA class II-restricted epitopes that woul d\ndrive humoral immune responses through cognate T cell help,\nproviding broad population coverage for a novel P. falciparum\nCSP protein (PfCSP) vaccine (\n61). In the course of a USAID-\nfunded program, more than 450 PfCSP epitope sequence variants\nwere analyzed and the optimal sequences (with highest cross-\nstrain coverage) were selected for the next stage of vaccine\ndevelopment. We also noted high interstrain variability in C SP\nT helper epitopes and a tendency for the more highly conserved\nCSP epitopes to be more cross-conserved with the human\ngenome (\n62).\niTEM Analysis: Analyzing Individual\nResponses to Vaccines\nThe RH5 antigen is a highly conserved P. falciparum blood-\nstage antigen that was recently assessed in a Phase I clinica l\ntrial of controlled human malaria infection by Draper and\ncolleagues at Oxford. We identiﬁed immunogenic (and non-\nhuman-like) epitopes in RH5 using iV AX and also analyzed\nthe immunogenic potential of an RH5 overlapping peptide set\nused in immune recall studies. Using EpiMatrix, ClustiMer,\nJanusMatrix, and iTEM (Individualized T cell Epitope Measure)\nas well as an adaptation of JanusMatrix to iTEM (J-iTEM),\nwe found T cell responses directly correlated with the\npresence of HLA-DR restricted ligands deﬁned using EpiMatrix\nand the absence of human-like T cell epitopes. Peptides\ninducing positive responses had higher iTEM and J-iTEM\nscores ( p < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively) than negative\npeptides (\n63).\nRetrospective Analysis of Individual\nResponses to Peptides From Vaccinia\nUsing iTEM\nClass II T cell epitopes from vaccinia virus proteins were\nidentiﬁed in IFN γ ELISpot assays using the PBMCs of smallpox\nvaccinees in a research study that used PBMC from clinical st udy\nvolunteers (\n64). An overlapping peptide library of four vaccinia\nmembrane proteins known to induce an immune response\nin vaccinated individuals was synthesized and tested in IFN γ\nELISPOT assays using the PBMCs of 29 recent smallpox vaccine\nrecipients. These T cell epitope sequences were retrospectively\nanalyzed using EpiMatrix and JanusMatrix. We found that the\npeptides identiﬁed as T cell epitopes were predicted to bind to\nclass II HLA supertype alleles more often than the remainder of\nthe overlapping peptide library ( p < 0.05) and that the peptides\nidentiﬁed as class II T cell epitopes had lower JanusMatrix hum an\nhomology scores than the remainder of the overlapping peptide\nlibrary ( p < 0.05). This is consistent with the identiﬁcation\nof T cell epitopes as described by the publication, suggesting\nthat in silico binding predictions correlated to T cell responses\nin vitro.\nIntegrating PigMatrix Into iVAX for Animal\nVaccine Development\nIn a proof of concept study that was recently published\nwith Crystal Loving and colleagues at Iowa State, we used\nimmunoinformatics tools to identify class I and II T cell\nepitopes highly conserved in seven representative strains of\nIAV in US swine and predicted to bind to prevalent Swine\nLeukocyte Antigen (SLA) alleles (\n57). The eﬃcacy of an\nintradermal-delivered plasmid DNA vaccine composed of these\nepitopes against H1N1pdm09 challenge was compared to an\nintramuscular commercial inactivated whole virus vaccine and\na heterologous prime-boost approach using both vaccines.\nRecently published results suggest the heterologous prime-boo st\napproach using an epitope-driven DNA vaccine followed by\nan inactivated vaccine was eﬀective against a homosubtypic\nchallenge, illustrating the utility of immunoinformatic\napproaches to vaccine design (\n65).\nT Cell Epitope Content Predicts\nVaccine-Related Protection Against\nEmerging Infectious Diseases\nThe EpiCC tool has been applied successfully to describe vaccine\nprotection against challenge strains for inﬂuenza A (\n58) and is\nbeing used prospectively to develop combination vaccines for\nadditional pathogens aﬀecting swine. The EpiCC tool is the most\nrecent tool to be integrated into iV AX; potential applications\ninclude determining where inﬂuenza virus “spillover” event s will\noccur (transmission of inﬂuenza from swine to humans) and\n“predicting the next pandemic” in collaboration with inﬂuenz a\nresearchers at the University of Georgia, Athens, USA.\nDeveloping Safe and Effective Cell\nTherapies for Cancer\nPredicting Adverse Effects of an Engineered TCR\nThe JanusMatrix tool may also be relevant for avoiding oﬀ-\ntarget eﬀects of cell therapies, such as TCR-engineered T cells\nor CAR-TCR cells. To illustrate the potential application of\nJanusMatrix to searching for safety signals in cell therapy, w e\nperformed an entirely in silico approach to evaluate potential\ncross-reactivity of an engineered TCR directed at a MageA3\npeptide presented by HLA A ∗0101 on tumors that was associated\nwith signiﬁcant (lethal) oﬀ target eﬀects (\n66). JanusMatrix\nconﬁrmed the potential for cross-reactivity at the TCR face o f\nsimilar self-epitopes predicted to be presented by HLA A ∗0101.\nOne of these epitopes was derived from Titin, a protein found\nin cardiac muscle. The oﬀ-target eﬀect of this TCR-engineered T\ncell therapy was attributed in a separate report to its potential for\ntargeting Titin epitopes [ Figure 7; (\n67)]. Concern about oﬀ target\neﬀects of engineered T cells and cancer vaccines is leading to\nthe development of additional algorithms that use T cell epitope\ncomparison to evaluate cancer vaccine risk (\n68).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al. Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\nFIGURE 7 | JanusMatrix Analysis of MageA3-HLA*0101-restricted T cel l epitope. Peptides containing identical T cell facing resi dues include variants of MageA3\n(Melanoma Associated Antigen) and three additional human p roteins, including human titin, one of the components of car diac smooth muscle. The ﬁgure shows that\nthe HLA-A*0101-restricted T cell epitope EVDPIGHVY is conse rved with an epitope that has identical HLA binding restrict ion but slightly different agretope\n(XSPDXXVAQY) and identical TCR facing residues (EXXPIXXXX) .\nEvaluating the Immunogenicity of CAR-T\nTransgenes\nAutologous T cells that have been transduced with genes\nthat express anti-tumor-speciﬁc antigens, such as CD19, have\nbeen demonstrated to have signiﬁcant antitumor activity in\nB cell malignancies. However, immunogenicity may aﬀect the\neﬃcacy of these T cells. In studies published by the CAR-\nT company Juno, CD8 + T cell–mediated anti-CAR transgene\nproduct immune responses developed after CAR–T cell infusion\nin some patients. These CD8 T cell responses limited CAR–T cell\npersistence and increased the risk of relapse risk. In the publi shed\nstudy, ﬁve patients that had developed persistent leukemia or\nrelapse after an initial infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-T receive d a\nsecond infusion of CAR-T cells (\n69). There was no expansion or\npersistence of CAR-T cells or demonstrable antitumor activi ty in\nany of the ﬁve patients and infusion was followed by the loss of\nCAR-T transduced T cell population.\nA follow up study evaluated T cell responses to overlapping\npeptides in vitro . This publication showed that the VH and\nVL domains of the CAR-T had a high amount of Class I\nepitope content. Using ∗A0101 and ∗A0301 as proxies for\nthe reported patient HLA type, EpiMatrix analysis showed\nagreement between predictions and immunogenic sequences.\nWe note here that, apart from the scFv, there are other\ncomponents that are part of the CAR-T structure (IgG4-\nhinge spacer, a CD28 transmembrane domain, a 4-1BB\ncostimulatory domain, and a CD3 ζ signaling domain). These\nsequences are human, but do have T cell epitope rich regions\nthat potentially contribute to the reported immunogenicity\nof CAR-T.\nCONCLUSION\nAdvances in vaccine design using computational tools,\nmeasurement of vaccine eﬃcacy using entirely in vitro systems,\nand vaccine delivery using a broad range of ﬂexible platforms\nare moving vaccine science beyond traditional “shake and ba ke”\n(whole killed vaccines) of yesteryear to “forecast and tell” design\nmethodologies of the future. Over the past 20 years, the teams\nworking at EpiVax and aﬃliated academic institutions have\ndeveloped tools to design vaccines and provided in vitro and in\nvivo evidence that immunoinformatics tools can be applied to\nvaccines that can eﬀectively protect against live bacterial an d viral\nchallenge. These tools can also be used to improve the design of\nexisting vaccines and to identify biomarkers of safety and e ﬃcacy.\nThe eﬀective integration of in silico immunoinformatics tools\nand ex vivo /in vitro and in vivo immune system technologies\nacross the entire vaccine development pipeline will enable\ndevelopers to predict and assess safety, toxicity, eﬃcacy, qu ality,\nand performance of vaccines, accelerating the development\nof safe, and eﬀective immunotherapy for a broad range of\npathogens and species.\nNew tools described in this report have been validated in\nretrospective and prospective studies described brieﬂy here ( in\nanticipation of extended publication of the results elsewher e)\nand in previous publications. We have shown that EpiMatrix\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al. Immunoinformatics-Driven Vaccine Discovery and Design\nand JanusMatrix algorithms eﬃciently identify putative T ce ll\nepitopes, distinguish likely inﬂammatory peptides from potenti al\nregulatory peptides and are adaptable to a patient HLA-speciﬁc\nlevel of assessment. These results conﬁrm that combining HL A-\nspeciﬁc epitope content and “selfness” improves prediction of\nimmunogenicity over either metric alone. Applying both tools\nin the early stages of vaccine design, antigen selection, an d\nengineering is likely to result in the advancement of next\ngeneration vaccines where the minimal essential components of\nprotection can be delivered without oﬀ-target or unintention ally\nsuppressive signals deleterious to vaccine eﬃcacy.\nA number of commercial and academic teams are actively\ndeveloping new vaccine design tools and have also contribute d\nto innovation in the area of computational vaccinology.\nSeveral groups have for example developed public and private\ncomputational tools for predicting proteasomal cleavage site s\n[NetChop (\n70)], class I [netMHC ( 71), netMHCpan ( 72),\nMHCﬂurry ( 73), EDGE ( 74)], and class II [netMHCII and\nnetMHCIIpan ( 75), TEPITOPE ( 76), RECON ( 77)] MHC-\nrestricted T cell epitopes, as well as tools for identifying li near and\ndiscontinuous B cell epitopes [BepiPred ( 78), DiscoTope ( 79)].\nThe “iV AX toolkit” is currently in use by EpiVax, Inc. for\nclients that include commercial ﬁrms and academic collabor ators\ndeveloping novel vaccines for malaria, Q fever and Burkholde ria\nfor commercial development and biodefense contracts, and by\nacademic groups that are engaged in federally funded programs\nfor analyzing immune responses to emerging/re-emerging\npathogens such as inﬂuenza (University of Georgia, Saint Loui s\nUniversity) and pertussis (Intravacc, Innatoss, VIC, and CDC ).\nEven more recently, EpiVax has created a seamless pipeline\nfor the design of personalized cancer vaccines that capitaliz es\non iV AX and its vaccine development and T cell immunology\nexpertise called Ancer. Collaborative studies carried out u sing\niV AX have demonstrated the importance of computational tools\nfor vaccine design and vaccine eﬃcacy studies. Additional\ncollaborations to evaluate the potential eﬃcacy of existing\nvaccines against newly emerging variants, to predict immune\nresponse to candidate antigens from newly emerging strains\nof infectious diseases, and to design novel vaccines that ha ve\nenhanced immunogenicity at an accelerated pace are possible\nand encouraged.\nTHE FUTURE\nDeveloping Personalized Vaccines\nTraditional cancer vaccines based on Tumor Associated Anti gens\n(TAAs) have for the most part failed in clinical trials (\n80–82).\nEvidence that is now emerging suggests that the reason they\nhave failed is because TAAs are broadly recognized as “Self” by\nthe immune system. New strategies are emerging in which thes e\nantigens may be modiﬁed to increase immunogenicity, using\ntools such as the ones described here. Careful analysis of som e\nof the standard TAAs that have been used in clinical studies\nreveals the presence of putative Treg inducing epitopes that may\nbe responsible for an immune-suppressive eﬀect.\nMeanwhile, the ﬁeld of cancer therapy has undergone a major\ntransformation in less than a decade due to the introduction\nof checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), next generation sequencing\n(NGS) and new emphasis on neo-epitopes. Neo-epitopes are\nT cell epitopes that contain tumor-speciﬁc non-synonymous\namino acid mutations that eﬀectively distinguish cancer (tum or)\nproteins from their normal counterparts. Neo-epitopes represent\nmutations to self-antigens that are recognized as “Non-Sel f” by\nthe individual’s own immune system, and are therefore capable\nof generating a potent immunogenic and clinical response.\nNew strategies for developing personalized vaccines that dir ect\nimmune responses to patient-speciﬁc T cell neo-epitopes are\nin development.\nUnlike TAAs, cancer neo-epitopes are not found in normal\ntissue. Also, unlike TAAs that may be present in more than\none tumor type and across patients, the vast majority of\nneo-epitopes are unique to each patient’s tumor. The cost\nof sequencing individual tumor genomes to discover neo-\nepitopes dropped precipitously to a few thousand dollars\nper genome in 2018. When combined with CPI, therapeutic\nvaccines based on neo-epitopes are highly likely to improve\noutcomes and may well be eﬀective as single agents in certain\nclinical settings.\nBeginning in 2016, EpiVax developed an end-to-end\nimmunoinformatics platform, separate from iV AX, that enable s\nthe rapid design of personalized, mutanome-directed therapeu tic\npeptide cancer vaccines. These vaccines target multiple antige ns\nspeciﬁc to a patient’s tumor, encoding several class I, and or cla ss\nII HLA restricted neo-epitopes.\nThis proprietary immunoinformatics pipeline, which\nincludes EpiMatrix and JanusMatrix and a version of iTEM\ncalled J-iTEM (see above descriptions) is called Ancer, and\nhas been exclusively licensed to EpiVax Oncology, Inc., a\nsubsidiary of EpiVax, established in 2017. EpiVax Oncology\nwill use Ancer to develop individualized cancer vaccine by\nscreening each cancer mutanome to identify tumor-speciﬁc\nneo-epitopes using EpiMatrix, ﬁlter out neo-epitopes that may\nbe tolerogenic using JanusMatrix, and rank the remaining\nneoantigens according to their optimal immunogenic proﬁle.\nWhile the number of companies that are developing tools for\nidentifying neo-epitopes is rapidly expanding, having access t o\nhigh throughput, commercial-grade and validated tools that\nincorporate consideration of the rules of self-tolerance wi ll be\ncritically important for the design of more eﬀective and safer\nvaccines for cancer immunotherapy.\nThe Next Frontier\nThe developers of the iV AX toolkit and the Ancer\npipeline can imagine a not-to-distant future when many\n“immunotherapies”—not only for cancer, but also for infectio us\ndiseases, autoimmune disease, and allergies, can be design ed\nand administered within weeks of diagnosis. We also anticipate\nbroader application of the tools to pathogens aﬄicting food\nanimals, including ﬁsh, and companion animals, as quickly\nas additional epitope prediction capacity can be added.\nTwenty years of computational development and collaborative\nvalidation studies have built a strong foundation. Computati onal\nvaccinology has a bright future and enormous potential to\nimprove human and animal health.\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442\nDe Groot et al.
