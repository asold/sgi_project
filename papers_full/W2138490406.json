This highly automated technology is\nproving to be effective for heterogeneous diseases and\nmay soon replace laborious conventional methods.\nHowever, the poor coverage of gene promoters and\nrepetitive, or GC-rich sequences, remains problematic,\nand validation of all identiﬁed variants is currently\nrequired.\nINTRODUCTION\nFamilial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common\nautosomal dominant genetic disease caused by\nmutations affecting the plasma clearance of\nLDL-cholesterol (LDL-C).\n1 FH patients have ele-\nvated levels of total and low-density lipoprotein\n(LDL) from birth, and if untreated, develop coron-\nary heart disease (CHD) by the age of 55 in 50% of\nmen and 30% of women.\n2 In addition to the\nincreased LDL-C, a proportion of FH patients is\ncharacterised by the occurrence of tendon xantho-\nmas (TX), and the UK Simon Broome criteria\n3 clas-\nsiﬁes TX-positive patients as Deﬁnite FH (DFH),\nand TX-negative patients as Possible FH (PFH),\nwith the DFH group having a three times higher\nrisk of developing CHD when compared with the\nPFH subjects.\n45 Statin therapy has been proven\nhighly effective in the treatment of FH patients,\nand the importance of an early identiﬁcation of FH\npatients for the statin treatment has been demon-\nstrated6 and recently highlighted.7\nThe clinical phenotype of FH is known to be\ndue to mutations in three genes encoding proteins\ninvolved in the clearance of LDL-C from the\nplasma, LDLR, APOB and PCSK9. There are over\n1200 different LDLR mutations,\n8 but only one\ncommon APOB (c.10580G>A, p.R3527Q) and one\nPCSK9 (c.1120G>T , p.D374Y) mutation, reported\nin the UK population.9 The majority of pathogenic\nLDLR variants are single nucleotide changes\nleading to signiﬁcant alterations in the amino acid\nsequence of the mature protein, or creation of a\ntruncated peptide. FH is also caused by variants\nthat affect correct splicing, and by changes in the\ntranscription-factor-binding elements located in\nthe promoter.\n10\nWhile LDLR/APOB/PCSK9 mutations cause a\ndominant pattern of inheritance, an autosomal\nrecessive hypercholesterolaemia (ARH) has also\nbeen observed. The locus for ARH was mapped to a\nchromosome 1 gene, theLDLRAP1, in which both\nhomozygous and compound heterozygous muta-\ntions can be found.\n11 Most of the ARH-causing\nmutations are due to premature stop codons.\nIn 2008, the UK National Institute for Health\nand Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were\npublished, and included a recommendation that all\nFH patients be offered a DNA test to conﬁrm their\ndiagnosis and, so that mutation con ﬁrmation\ncould be used, to cascade-test theirﬁrst-degree rela-\ntives. Newly identiﬁed patients can then be offered\nstatin treatment.\n12 In most laboratories, FH muta-\ntion screening includes use of commercially avail-\nable kits designed to test for the most common\nmutations, such as Elucigene FH20 (Gen-Probe Life\nSciences, UK) and LIPOchip (Progenica Biopharma,\nSpain), and for large gene rearrangements (dele-\ntions or duplications), which account for 4%– 5%\nof all FH mutations.\n13 However, in the UK, due to\nthe highly heterogeneous nature of the population\nthis approach is not fully effective, and many\npatient samples require screening the LDLR pro-\nmoter and coding regions, splice sites and splice\nbranch points for causative mutations, and in the\ndiagnostic laboratory this is currently performed\nusing Sanger sequencing. Because of the time and\nlabour of these methods, there has been interest in\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for\nthe diagnosis of genetic disorders. However,\nwhether NGS is ready for clinical use has been\nquestioned.\n14 Main limitations of the technology\ninclude the requirement for complex data analysis,\nThis paper is freely available\nonline under the BMJ Journals\nunlocked scheme, see http://\njmg.bmj.com/site/about/\nunlocked.xhtml\n644 J Med Genet2012;49:644–649. doi:10.1136/jmedgenet-2012-101189\nMethods\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on November 5, 2025 http://jmg.bmj.com/Downloaded from 10 October 2012. 10.1136/jmedgenet-2012-101189 on J Med Genet: first published as \nsigniﬁcant computing infrastructure with respect to data ana-\nlysis and storage, and legal and ethical issues associated with\nincidental ﬁndings from acquiring whole exome data. In the\nresearch laboratory a four-phased approach is used to screen FH\npatients to identify the causative mutation, using the commer-\ncially available Ampliﬁcation Refractory Mutation System kit,\nwhich tests for 20 of the most common UK mutations, fol-\nlowed by High-Resolution Melting (HRM) to detect changes\nwithin the coding region and splice sites of FH genes, followed\nby Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Ampliﬁcation (MLPA),\nfor the detection of large LDLR gene rearrangements, and\nﬁnally Sanger sequencing.\n15– 17 Using standard molecular diag-\nnostic techniques, an FH-causing mutation can be detected in\n20%– 30% of PFH patients, and in 60%– 80% of DFH patients.\n18\nThe UK10K is a large-scale deep-sequencing project, based on\ncollaboration between multiple investigators at the W ellcome\nT rust Sanger Institute, and clinical experts in different genetic\ndiseases. A total of 125 FH samples with no LDLR/APOB/\nPCSK9 mutation are currently in the exome sequencing pipe-\nline, as a part of the Rare Diseases group of the UK10K. The\naim of the project is to provide collaborators with high-quality\nexome data, which will be used for the discovery of novel\ndisease genes. This paper reports the sequencing results of the\nﬁrst 48 FH exomes, and discusses sensitivity problems of the\ncurrent FH mutation-screening methods, as well as demonstrat-\ning advantages and limitations of the whole exome sequencing\napproach.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients’ selection\nForty-eight unrelated FH patients were selected from the\nSimon Broome FH register.19 All individuals were Caucasian\nand attended a lipid clinic in London, Oxford or Manchester.\nPatients were diagnosed using the UK Simon Broome criteria as\nDFH on the basis of the presence or history of TX. The entire\npromoter and coding regions, including splice sites, of the\nLDLR gene were screened by the HRM method, as previously\ndescribed,\n16 on the Rotor-Gene (6000) real-time rotary analyser.\nPatients were screened for presence of theAPOB mutation, p.\n(R3527Q), using a restriction enzyme digest,20 and the entire\ncoding region of the PCSK9 was examined by HRM. 17\nFragments with a heterozygous melting curve were analysed\nfurther by direct sequencing. Screening for large rearrangements\nwithin the LDLR gene was done using the MLPA\n21 SALSA\nP062 LDLR kit from MRC-Holland (Amsterdam). One hundred\nand ninetyﬁve non-FH Caucasian samples, sequenced in paral-\nlel with the FH cohort, as a part of the UK10K rare disease arm\nproject (http://www.uk10k.org/studies/rarediseases.html), were\nused as controls. None of these subjects had disorders known\nto affect plasma lipid levels.\nWhole exome sequencing\nGenomic DNA (1– 3 μg), extracted from blood,22 was sheared to\n100– 400 bp using a Covaris E210 or LE220 (Covaris, W oburn,\nMassachusetts, USA). Sheared DNA was subjected to Illumina\npaired-end DNA library preparation and enriched for target\nsequences (Agilent T echnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA;\nHuman All Exon 50 Mb - ELID S02972011) according to the\nmanufacturer’s recommendations (Agilent T echnologies, Santa\nClara, CA, USA; SureSelectXT Automated T arget Enrichment\nfor Illumina Paired-End Multiplexed Sequencing). Enriched\nlibraries were sequenced (eight samples over two lines) using\nthe HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) as paired-end 75 base reads\naccording to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nBioinformatic analysis\nT o improve raw alignment BAMs for single nucleotide poly-\nmorphism (SNP) calling, we realigned around known (1000\nGenomes pilot) indels, and recalibrated base quality scores using\nGATK. BAQ tags were added using samtools calmd. BAMs were\nmerged to sample level and duplicates marked using Picard.\nV ariants (SNPs and indels) were called on each sample individu-\nally with both samtools mpileup (0.1.17) and GATK\nUnifedGenotyper (1.3– 21), restricted to exon bait regions plus or\nminus a 100 bp window. V arious qualityﬁlters were applied to\neach of the callsets separately. Calls were then merged, giving\npreference to GATK information when possible. Calls were\nannotated with 1000 Genomes allele frequencies, dbSNP132\nrsIDs and earliest appearance in dbSNP . Functional annotation\nwas added using Ensembl V ariant Effect Predictor v2.2 against\nEnsembl 64, and included coding consequence predictions,\nSorting T olerant From Intolerant (SIFT), PolyPhen and Condel\nannotations, and Genomic Evolutionary Rate Proﬁling (GERP)\nand Grantham Matrix scores. V ariants previously reported by\nthe 1000 Genomes project with minor allele frequency higher\nthan 0.01 wereﬁltered out. V ariants that passed the initialﬁlter-\ning were compared against 195 non-FH control whole exomes,\nprocessed using the same pipeline, and only FH unique changes\nwere further assessed. Pathogenicity of any private (ie, speciﬁc\nto the FH cohort) variant was examined using previous knowl-\nedge and by bioinformatic mutation-prediction tools, which\nincluded: PolyPhen2, SIFT , Condel, Mutation T aster, PhyloP and\nGratham Score algorithm. Sanger sequencing was used to\nconﬁrm presence of any identiﬁed predicted pathogenic variant.\nCopy number variants analysis\nThe copy number variants (CNV) analysis uses a read depth\nstrategy designed to overcome biases associated with sequence\ncapture and high-throughput sequencing. This set of tools is\nimplemented in the package ExomeDepth (freely available at\nthe Comprehensive R Archive Network.\n23\nRESULTS\nOverall, the mean read depth for the whole exome sequence\nwas 72x, with 78.9% of the exome covered at least 20x; and\n55.8% of the targeted sequence was covered 50x or more.\nLDLR analysis\nThe average read depth ofLDLR exons varied from 136x for\nexon 12, to 4x for exon 18 (ﬁgure 1). Using a 16x coverage\nthreshold, which would give a 99% probability of observing a\nrare allele at least three times, all except exons 1 and 18 showed\nadequate coverage. Exons 3 and 4 contain the largest number of\nreported FH-causing mutations,\n24 and both these exons were\nwell covered (mean depth 92 and 57, respectively).\nAs shown in table 1, in 14 out of the 48 samples, a\nFH-unique variant in theLDLR was called, in 11 of these the\nvariant has been previously reported to be FH-causing.25\nAll these variants were conﬁrmed to be correct by Sanger\nsequencing of duplicate DNA samples (not shown). The variants\nincluded ﬁve different missense mutations and ﬁve nonsense\nmutations. The two novel LDLR variants included: c.695-6_\n698del and c.1776_1778del (p.(G592del)). The c.695-6_698del is\npredicted to cause a frameshift and a premature stop codon by\naltering LDLR splicing (see online supplementaryﬁgure S1). The\ndeletion of Glycine at residue 592 is predicted to disrupt pack-\naging of the LDL-R propeller blades in the epidermal growth\nfactor (EGF) domain, which could affect displacement of the\nJ Med Genet2012;49:644–649. doi:10.1136/jmedgenet-2012-101189 645\nMethods\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on November 5, 2025 http://jmg.bmj.com/Downloaded from 10 October 2012. 10.1136/jmedgenet-2012-101189 on J Med Genet: first published as \nligand from the ligand-binding region (see online supplementary\nﬁgure S2). Of these 14 mutations, all should have been detected\nby our standard screening protocol described in the Materials and\nmethods section, except for c.695-6_698del, where the change\nwas located in the primer sequence used for PCR.\nCNV calling identiﬁed one deletion of exons 11 and 12 (c.\n1587−?_1845+?del), and two duplications of exons 3–8 (191−?\n_1186+?dup), and exons 13– 15 (c.1846 −?_2311+?dup), as\nshown in ﬁgure 2. All CNVs were conﬁrmed by MLPA (see\nonline supplementaryﬁgure S3).\nAPOB analysis\nThe mean read depth ofAPOB exons was 93. Exons 26 and 29\nwere covered on average 135x, whereas exon 1 was covered\nonly once (ﬁgure 1). T wo individuals were found to carry the\nFH-causing APOB mutation in exon 26, the p.(R3527Q). There\nwere no nonsense or frameshift mutations observed in the gene\nsequence. One novel non-synonymous variant was found in\nexon 26 of APOB, the p.(A3426V), which was unique to the\nFH cohort. The variant was predicted as‘T olerated’, ‘Benign’\nand ‘Polymorphism’ by SIFT , PolyPhen and Mutation T aster,\nrespectively. Four other FH-unique non-synonymous variants\nwere observed outside of the ligand-binding domain (see online\nsupplementary table S1). The functional impact of these var-\niants, as predicted by PolyPhen/SIFT/Mutation T aster, was not\nconsistent, and whether or not these are FH-causing is unclear.\nThere were no CNVs found within theAPOB gene.\nPCSK9 analysis\nThe mean read depth of thePCSK9 exons was 23. Of these,\nonly 58% of the gene coding sequence had the mean coverage\nhigher than 16, whereas exons 1, 6, 10, 11 and 12 were covered\n4x on average ( ﬁgure 1). Exon 7, where the common UK\nFH-causing mutation (c.1120G>T , p.(D374Y)) occurs, was\ncovered 36x. T wo novel non-synonymous variants were called\nby the exome sequencing, c.1027G>C and c.1028A>C, both\npresent in the same sample. However, despite the high read\ndepth (51x and 50x), and the high number of read count for the\nnovel alleles (19 and 26) (see online supplementaryﬁgure S4)\nthe Sanger sequencing did not conﬁrm the variants. There were\nno CNVs observed inPCSK9.\nLDLRAP1 analysis\nThe average read depth ofLDLRAP1 was 36 with all, except exons\n1 and 9 covered above the 16x threshold (ﬁgure 1). TheLDLRAP1\nvariant analysis was performed using a homozygosity-based strat-\negy, and the presence of compound heterozygote variants was\nalso assessed. There were no homozygous or compound heterozy-\ngous functional changes within the gene in any of the individuals.\nOne patient was found to be heterozygous for a known Sicilian/\nSardinian ARH mutation, the c.432_433insA, p.(A145KfsX26),\nTable 1 Summary of pathogenic single nucleotide changes and small deletions/insertions in the FH genes\nGene Samples (n) Nucleotide change Functional effect Depth Quality Comments\nLDLR 1 c.326G>A p.(C109Y) 43 506 known FH mutation\n1 c.1690A>C p.(N564H) 36 343 known FH mutation\n1 c.1823C>T p.(P608L) 82 1214 known FH mutation\n1 c.2054C>T p.(P685L) 20 135 known FH mutation\n1 c.2479G>A p.(V827I) 65 749 known FH mutation\n2 c.682G>T p.(E228X) 13 155 known FH mutation\n1 c.1048C>T p.(R350X) 60 816 known FH mutation\n1 c.1150C>T p.(Q384X) 20 275 known FH mutation\n1 c.1685G>A p.(W562X) 41 701 known FH mutation\n1 c.2140+1G>A Splicing 22 258 known FH mutation\n1 c.695-6_698del Splicing 36 1543 novel\n2 c.1776_1778del p.(G592del) 148 2634 novel\nAPOB 1 c.10277G>A p.(A3426V) 192 2785 novel\n2 c.10580C>T p.(R3527Q) 161 2144 known FH mutation\nPCSK9 1 c.1027G>C p.(D343H) 51 44 false positive\n1 c.1028A>C p.(D343A) 50 201 false positive\nLDLRAP1 1 c.432_433insA p.(A145KfsX26) 90 2186 heterozygous\n‘Depth’ refers to the coverage depth;‘Quality’ values are Phred-like quality scores generated by SAMtools.\nFigure 1 The exonic coverage of FH\ngenes: APOB, LDLR, LDLRAP1 and\nPCSK9 in a standard box plot (the\nminimum, lower quartile, median,\nupper quartile and maximum for each\ngene exon).

Overall, the standard variant-detection\nprocess already in place (HRM, MLPA and Sanger sequencing)\ndid not detect 17LDLR mutations (including 3 CNVs) and 2\nAPOB mutations. Although the HRM has proved to be efﬁcient\nat detecting FH variants,\n16 its sensitivity decreases in some\ngene regions, depending on the nucleotide composition of the\nfragment. Re-examining previous results for the samples with a\nLDLR or APOB variant called by the NGS, we observed that\nmost of the variants showed a melting curve shift during the\nHRM assay, but Sanger sequencing of the identiﬁed gene region\ndid not detect any heterozygous changes in the sequence\ndespite being repeated several times (i.e. only the predicted\nwild-type sequence was obtained). After the exome sequencing,\nthe Sanger sequencing was repeated on a duplicate DNA\nsample, and the predicted mutations were conﬁrmed to be\npresent, validating the exome sequencing and variant calling.\nAlthough Sanger sequencing is considered to be the gold stand-\nard mutation-detection method, a combination of PCR arte-\nfacts and the human error aspect in the protocol appears to be\nthe main reason for the false negative calling in the original\nscreening.\nNovel LDLR variants\nT wo novel variants inLDLR were identiﬁed, a deletion of 10 bp\non boundary of intron 4 and exon 5, which is predicted to\ncause a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon by alter-\ning LDLR splicing, and a three bp deletion which deletes\nGlycine at residue 592, which is predicted to disrupt packaging\nof the LDL-R propeller blades in the EGF domain. Neither of\nthese variants are found in dbSNP , the 1000 Genomes or the\nNHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, and are highly likely to be\nFH-causing, although further work is required to conﬁrm this.\nNovel APOB variants\nAPOB codes for one of the largest human proteins, which is the\nmajor component of the LDL-C responsible for binding to\nthe LDL receptor.\n27 The actual binding site for the receptor, the\nB-site (residues 3386 – 3396), has been mapped to a region\nencoded by exon 26 of theAPOB, which is the longest coding\nexon known (7572 bps).28 In addition, the C-terminus encoded\nby exon 29 of the gene was proposed to function as a modula-\ntor of the receptor binding.\n28 Therefore, our variant analysis\nstrategy prioritised novel variants located in exons 26 and 29 of\nthe gene, as these are more likely to cause the FH phenotype.\nIn this study, there was only one novel variant identiﬁed in the\nexon 26 of APOB, the c.10277G>A (p.(A3426V)), which was\nnot observed previously by the dbSNP , the 1000 Genomes or\nthe NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. The variant was not\npresent in the 195 non-FH exomes from the UK10K project,\nwhich were processed using the same pipeline, increasing the\nlikelihood that it is in fact disease-causing. The novel p.\nFigure 2 Copy Number Variants (CNVs) inLDLR gene. A:\nheterozygous duplication of exons 3– 8. B: heterozygous deletion of\nexons 11 and 12. C: heterozygous duplication of exons 13– 15.

This requires further experiments since the current\nin silico prediction tools are not able to assess protein– protein\ninteractions. W e will also examine whether or not the variant\ncosegregates with the disease. Four other novelAPOB variants\nwere identiﬁed in this group of patients in the N-terminal part\nof the protein. Although these variants are less likely to inﬂu-\nence LDL clearance from the blood, since the N-terminal region\nof the protein is not involved in interacting with the LDL-R,\nsome of the variants are predicted as damaging by Polyphen or\nSIFT . The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of\nexome sequencing as a sensitive mutation detection tool, rather\nthan ﬁnding novel FH mutations. Future work includes the\nassessment of novel identi ﬁed variants, which will involve\nfamily cosegregation and functional assays.\nPromoter region analyses\nMost of the sequencing data generated for Mendelian disorders\nare focused on the exome, which constitutes around 1% of the\nwhole human genome. Prediction tools for the analysis of non-\nsynonymous changes are well established and widely used to\nestimate the deleteriousness of amino acid changes. However,\nsince the majority of human variations are located in the non-\ncoding regions,\n29 concern about the bias towards variants in\nthe protein-coding sequence was highlighted. 30 Proving the\npathogenic effect of promoter variants requires use of func-\ntional assays. T o date, there are 13LDLR promoter variants pre-\ndicted to be causal (in revision\n10). Disappointingly, but not\nsurprisingly, given they were not targeted, the exome sequen-\ncing data generated by the SureSelect Human All Exon\n(Agilent) assay, had negligible coverage of the gene promoter\nregions, which can lead to false negative conclusions. Further\nupdates of the human exome capture assay should include\ncoverage of the LDLR promoter sequences, which can cause\nautosomal dominant disease by altering gene regulation.\nExome sequencing\nThe SureSelect Human All Exons capture assay is a standard\nproduct, which proved to be efﬁcient at detecting mutations\nwithin theLDLR and theAPOB genes. In this sample, 78.9% of\nexome bases were covered at least 20 times, which is in line\nwith the product description∼80%. For bothLDLR and APOB,\nthe majority of the coding sequence was covered more than the\n16x threshold to achieve an estimated 99% chance of seeing a\nreal variant (present in a heterozygous state) of at least 3\ntimes, and overall 19 mutations, were found by high-\nthroughput DNA sequencing, which had been missed by con-\nventional methods in our research laboratory. This indicates\nincreased sensitivity for NGS, which can be due both to the\nmethod used and to the reduced human intervention, and the\nhighly automated protocol. However, as with many PCR-based\nmethods, exome sequencing has some limitations when it\ncomes to ampliﬁcation of highly repetitive regions or sequences\nrich in GC content. A highly signiﬁcant negative correlation\nbetween the G/C content and the exome depth was observed\nin the FH genes (p=4.9×10\n−14), as shown in the online supple-\nmentary ﬁgure S5. Speciﬁcally, only 58% of thePCSK9 gene\nwas covered more than 16x, producing unreliable results for\nvariant calling in a signiﬁcant proportion of the gene’s coding\nregion. As a result, the two novel non-synonymousPCSK9 var-\niants called by the exome sequencing were not conﬁrmed by\nthe capillary sequencing, suggesting a high rate of false positive\ncalls when the coverage is poor. If a read depth threshold of\n30x was considered to be required for complete certainty of\nvariant calling, at which the sensitivity to detect heterozygous\nvariants was shown to be 100%,\n31 exons that would be insufﬁ-\nciently covered would also include exons 1, 14 and 18 ofLDLR,\nexons 2 and 5 ofPCSK9, and exons 2, 3 and 7 ofLDLRAP1.\nThus, although the quality of the produced data is good, valid-\nation of called variants in poorly covered regions is still neces-\nsary. Applying more stringentﬁlters to the raw data increases\nthe speciﬁcity of the calling. However, it may also lead to false\nnegative results, since not all of the exome’s regions are equally\ncovered. Newer versions of the SureSelect assay show markedly\nimproved coverage of exons that were previously poorly covered\n(unpublished data), so we can expect the sensitivity of exome\nsequencing to improve.\nThe Agilent SureSelect assay was efﬁcient in capturing the\nexon– intron junctions, covering on average 80–100bps of the\nintronic regions. This was an advantage over our current screen-\ning protocol, and enabled us to detect a novel variant, the\nc.695-6_698del, which is partially positioned on the annealing\nsite for the sequencing primer routinely used in our lab.\nThe methodology behind the ExomeDepth package\n23 proved\nto be robust, and enabled us to use the exome data, which are\ncomposed of short sequence reads for exonic regions, to detect\nlarge gene rearrangements, which are known in theLDLR to be\nusually due to intronic Alu sequence misparing.\n32 33 The\nmethod was shown to allow identiﬁcation of heterozygous\nCNVs within the LDLR gene, which were missed by the cur-\nrently used MLPA. However, in order to maximise the sensitiv-\nity and to minimise the noise created by technical variability\nbetween samples, CNV analysis by Exome Depth requires\nquality data of well-matched exomes (>6 samples), that is,\nsequenced under the exact same conditions.\nThe greater time efﬁciency of the exome sequencing is a signiﬁ-\ncant advantage over the current screening methods. Although\neach called variant currently needs to be individually conﬁrmed\nby Sanger sequencing before a mutation report can be prepared,\nanalysing a number of patients in parallel in a short period of\ntime is likely to be an efﬁcient way forward for screening of het-\nerogeneous FH patients. More importantly, limited use of manual\nchecks and human intervention reduce the issues of possible\nhuman error. The cost efﬁciency of NGS is also increasing. The\ndevelopment of novel approaches of gene-targeted sequencing,\nusing Illumina MiSeq platform, reduces not only the costs of\nsequencing itself but also the time spent on data analysis and\ncomputer storage requirements. The possibility of designing\ncustom amplicons for each disease, recently offered by Illumina\nT ruSeq Custom Amplicon or Agilent HaloPlex products, will also\nimprove the capture of promoters and other regulatory regions,\nwhich could be omitted in whole exome eequencing.\nAcknowledgements We thank Ebele Usifo for carrying out the functional analysis\nprediction for the novelLDLR variant.
