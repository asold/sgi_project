  "abstract": "The Hot Spot Temperature (HST) value depends on the ambient temperature, the rise in the top oil temperature (TOT) over the ambient temperature, and the rise in the winding HST over the top oil temperature.In this paper a new semi-physical model comprising of the environmental variables for the estimation of HST and loss of insulation life in transformer is proposed.The winding hot-spot temperature can be calculated as a function of the top-oil temperature that can be estimated using the transformer loading data, top oil temperature lagged regressor value, ambient temperature, wind velocity and solar heat radiation effect.The estimated HST is compared with measured data of a power transformer in operation.The proposed model has been validated using real data gathered from a 100 MVA power transformer.",
