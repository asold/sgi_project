  "abstract": "Language models have contributed to breakthroughs in interdisciplinary research, such as protein design and molecular dynamics understanding. In this study, we reveal that beyond language, representations of other entities, such as human behaviors, that are mappable to learnable sequences can be learned by language models. One compelling example is the real-world delivery route optimization problem. We here propose a novel approach based on the language model to optimize delivery routes on the basis of drivers' historical experiences. Although a broad range of optimization-based approaches have been designed to optimize delivery routes, they do not capture the implicit knowledge of complex delivery operating environments. The model we propose integrates this knowledge in the route optimization process by learning from driving behaviors in experienced drivers. A real-world delivery route that preserves drivers' implicit behavioral patterns is first analogized to a sentence in natural language. Through unsupervised learning, we then learn the vector representations of words and infer the drivers' delivery chains on the basis of the tailored chain-reaction-based algorithm. We also provide insights into the fusion of language models and operations research methods. In our approach, language models are applied to learn drivers' delivery behaviors and infer new deliveries at the delivery zone level, while the classic traveling salesman problem (TSP) model is embedded into the hybrid framework for intra-zone optimization. Numerical experiments performed on real-world data from Amazon's delivery service demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms pure optimization, supporting the effectiveness, efficiency, and extensibility of our model. As a versatile approach, the proposed framework can easily be extended to various disciplines in which the data follow certain grammar rules. We anticipate that our work will serve as a stepping stone toward the understanding and application of language models in tackling interdisciplinary research problems.",
