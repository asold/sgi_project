We release the generated data at\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/Gen-X.\n1 Introduction\nThe success of NLP models greatly depends on\nthe availability and quality of training data. This\nposes a significant challenge for multilingual NLP,\nas data for languages other than English is typically\nlimited (Ponti et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2020; White-\nhouse et al., 2022). An approach to address the\ndata scarcity challenge is through zero-shot cross-\nlingual transfer or multitask training, in which a\n∗ ∗Work conducted while visiting MBZUAI.\nmodel is trained across data of diverse tasks and\nlanguages, exhibiting the capability to handle un-\nseen tasks, particularly in larger models (Artetxe\nand Schwenk, 2019; Nooralahzadeh et al., 2020;\nHuang et al., 2021). However, when aiming for\ntask-specific objectives, a smaller, fine-tuned model\ndedicated to that particular task often outperforms\nlarger general-purpose, zero-shot models. In addi-\ntion, a smaller task-specific model is more practi-\ncal and cost-effective for training and deployment.\nNevertheless, developing a powerful task-specific\nmodel becomes challenging in the absence of train-\ning data (Lauscher et al., 2020).\nConversely, recent powerful Large Language\nModels (LLMs) excel at handling general instruc-\ntions and have shown promise in data genera-\ntion tasks (Wang et al., 2023). In this work, we\nleverage LLMs to generate synthetic data for var-\nious multilingual commonsense reasoning tasks,\nXCOPA (Ponti et al., 2020), XWinograd (Tikhonov\nand Ryabinin, 2021), and XStoryCloze (Lin et al.,\n2022), where the training data is limited even for\nEnglish (see Table 1). To augment the training data,\nwe provide LLMs with instructions and examples\nfrom the original training data, prompting them to\ngenerate new and diverse examples. We explore\nthe generation of synthetic data in English using\ndifferent LLMs, including open-source models like\nDolly-v21 and StableVicuna2, as well as ChatGPT\nand GPT-4. Although the weights and capabili-\nties of the latter two models remain undisclosed,\nwe explore them as they extend the capability of\ngenerating texts in languages beyond English.\nWe develop task-specific models by fine-tuning\nmultilingual pre-trained language models, namely\nmBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and XLM-R (Con-\nneau et al., 2020), using the generated data. We\nthen compare their performance against models\ntrained on a limited set of human-created data in the\n1https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly\n2https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM\n671\nDATASET Train Validation Test\nEN XX EN XX EN XX\nXCOPA 400 0 100 100 500 500\nXWinograd 1858 0 233 0 233 424\nXStoryCloze 300 300 60 60 1511 1511\nTable 1: Number of examples available in XCOPA,\nXWinograd, and XStoryCloze. XX denotes the average\nnumber of non-English examples per language. Since a\nvalidation split is not specified in XStoryCloze, we take\n60 random examples from the train split for validation.\nXWinograd has no train/validation/test split, and we\nfollow an 80/10/10 split for the experiments.\ntarget language whenever available, and otherwise\nthrough zero-shot transfer learning from manually\ncreated English training data. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that training the models withrelatively\nlarge synthetically generated datasets yields better\nperformance than training with limited manually-\ncreated datasets. This finding empirically confirms\nthe utility of synthetic data generated by LLMs for\nimproving downstream task-specific models.\nWe expand the multilingual data synthesis using\nChatGPT and GPT-4 on XCOPA and find that gen-\nerating multilingual datasets generally surpasses\nthe effectiveness of the zero-shot cross-lingual\ntransfer. We further assess the quality of the gener-\nated dataset in different languages by asking native\nspeakers to evaluate the naturalness and logical\nsoundness of the generated dataset compared to the\nhuman-written examples. The annotation results\nreveal that while ChatGPT and GPT-4 successfully\ngenerate natural text in most languages, they strug-\ngle with generating understandable text in certain\nlanguages such as Tamil. Moreover, a noticeable\ngap is observed in terms of commonsense coher-\nence when comparing ChatGPT-generated data to\nhuman-constructed data. On the other hand, GPT-4\nsignificantly narrows this difference.\nTo summarise, our work has the following key\ncontributions:\n• Augmenting three low-resource, multilingual\ncommonsense reasoning datasets by leverag-\ning and prompting four LLMs;\n• Fine-tuning smaller models, mBERT and\nXLMR, using the synthesised data and show-\ncasing the practical value of the LLM-\ngenerated data;\n• Performing an extensive analysis of the effects\nof various target languages in data generation\nand scaling, as well as a human evaluation of\nthe naturalness and logical coherence of the\ndata generated in various languages;\n• Releasing the synthesised datasets for public\nuse and reproducibility.\n2 Related Work\nMultilingual and Low-Resource NLP\nRecently, there has been increased attention on\nexpanding NLP beyond English, including the de-\nvelopment of multilingual models (Devlin et al.,\n2019; Conneau et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2021; Scao\net al., 2022) as well as the creation of benchmarks\nto address multilingual challenges (Conneau et al.,\n2018; Artetxe et al., 2020; Adelani et al., 2021;\nWinata et al., 2023). Among the prevailing chal-\nlenges faced across various languages, a common\ntheme is the scarcity of available data.\nConsequently, when data is lacking, one ap-\nproach is to employ zero-shot cross-lingual trans-\nfer. Studies conducted by Winata et al. (2023) have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of zero-shot cross-\nlingual transfer for related languages. Additionally,\nMuennighoff et al. (2023) show that models fine-\ntuned only with English instruction data are capable\nof understanding multilingual instructions. In this\nwork, we are tackling a similar scenario where the\navailability of data is limited.\nMultilingual Data Augmentation\nLauscher et al. (2020) show that few-shot can dras-\ntically increase the cross-lingual performance of\nsmall models, proving that multilingual data aug-\nmentation is an effective strategy. A series of works\ntry to predict the cross-lingual accuracy of models\nthrough measurements and modelling (Xia et al.,\n2020), and study strategies for multilingual data\naugmentation, such as choosing the transfer lan-\nguages (Lin et al., 2019), and predicting multilin-\ngual few-shot accuracy leading for optimal data\naugmentation approaches (Srinivasan et al., 2022).\nMany works focus on synthetic data augmenta-\ntion for code-mixing, including utilising linguistic\ntheories (Lee et al., 2019; Pratapa et al., 2018), ma-\nchine translation models (Tarunesh et al., 2021),\nparallel corpus and Wikipedia (Winata et al., 2019;\nWhitehouse et al., 2022), and employing ChatGPT\n(Dai et al., 2023). Our work explores data augmen-\ntation on multilingual commonsense datasets with\npowerful instruction-tuned LLMs.\n672\nXCOPA XWINOGRAD XSTORYCLOZE\nWe are collecting more examples for the\nCOPA dataset which will be used to test a\nsystem’s ability of Commonsense Causal\nJudgments. The format of the data:\nA premise: a statement of something that\nhappened, and two choices that could plau-\nsibly {occur as the result/ be the cause}\nof the premise. The correct choice is the\nalternative that is more plausible than the\nwrong choice.\nHere arenexamples in{language}:\nExample 1: Premise: The man wanted to\nsave money. What happened as a result?\nCorrect choice: He cut back on making\nfrivolous purchases. Wrong choice: He\nwithdrew money from his savings account.\n. . . Examplen: . . .\nBased on the examples above, generatem\nnew examples in{language}.\nWe are collecting more examples for\nthe Winograd Schema Challenge. Each\nexample has a short sentence that con-\ntains two noun phrases and one pronoun\nreplaced by “_”, and the challenge is to de-\ntermine the referent of the pronoun, which\ncan only be inferred from the context.\nHere arenexamples of the data:\nExample 1: Sentence: Harley hides from\nDyna because _ is scary. Who/What is\nscary? Correct answer: Dyna. Wrong an-\nswer: Harley. . . . Examplen: . . .\nBased on the examples above, generate\nmnew examples. Both noun phrases in\neach example can be males, females, inan-\nimate objects, or groups of people or ob-\njects. There should only be one “_” in the\nsentence. The correct and wrong answer\nshould be one of the noun phrases men-\ntioned in the sentence.\nWe are collecting more examples for a story cloze\ndataset. Each example consists of a 4-sentence story,\none correct ending sentence which is a plausible continu-\nation of the story, and one wrong ending sentence which\nis logically inconsistent with the context.\nHere arenexamples of the data:\nExample 1: Sent-1: Tina is very tired every single morn-\ning. Sent-2: She does not get enough sleep because of\nher two jobs. Sent-3: Tina decides to quit one of the jobs.\nSent-4: She now gets enough sleep to function everyday.\nCorrect ending: Tina is well rested. Wrong ending: Tina\nis more tired than ever before. . . . Examplen: . . .\nBased on the examples above, providemnew similar\nexamples. Requirements: 1) the story should read like\na coherent story, with a specific beginning and ending,\nwhere something happens in between 2) both ending\nsentences should be entirely reasonable, realistic and\nsensible when read in isolation, and 3) both ending sen-\ntences should follow up the story by sharing at least one\nof the characters of the story.\nPremise: The politician made a contro-\nversial statement. What happened as a re-\nsult? Correct choice: The politician faced\ncriticism from the media. Wrong choice:\nThe politician’s approval ratings increased.\nPremise:我裤子口袋里的钥匙不见\n了。What was the cause?

Wrong answer: Andrew.\nSentence: The dog chased the cat , but\n_ was too fast. Who/What was too fast?\nCorrect answer: the cat. Wrong answer:\nThe dog.\nSent-1: Jordan was a high school student who wanted\nto become a doctor. Sent-2: He spent all his free time\nstudying biology and chemistry. Sent-3: One day, his\nschool hosted a science fair competition. Sent-4: Jor-\ndan’s project won first place. Correct ending: Jordan\nwent on to study medicine in college. Wrong ending:\nJordan gave up his dream of becoming a doctor.\nTable 2: Examples of instructions and LLM-responses (ChatGPT) for XCOPA, XWinograd, and XStoryCloze.\n3 Dataset Augmentation\nOur experiments use XCOPA, XWinograd, and XS-\ntoryCloze, which are selected due to (1) the limited\navailability of training data and (2) commonsense\nreasoning datasets present greater challenges for\ndata synthesis. Table 1 summarises the statistics of\nthe three datasets.\nXCOPA is a cross-lingual Choice of Plausible\nAlternatives dataset that translates and re-annotates\nthe validation and test sets of English (EN) COPA\n(Roemmele et al., 2011) into 11 target languages\n(ET: Estonian, HT: Haitian Creole, ID: Indonesian,\nIT: Italian, QU: Quechua, SW: Swahili, TA: Tamil,\nTH: Thai, TR: Turkish, VI: Vietnamese, and ZH:\nChinese).3 Each instance consists of a premise, a\nquestion (cuase/result), and two alternatives. The\ntask is to predict the more plausible alternative.\nXWinograd expands the original English Wino-\ngrad Schema Challenge (WSC) (Levesque et al.,\n2012) to five other languages (FR: French, JA:\nJapanese, PT: Portuguese, RU: Russian, and ZH),4\nwhich consists of pronoun resolution problems aim-\n3https://huggingface.co/datasets/xcopa\n4https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/\nxwinograd\ning to evaluate the commonsense reasoning ability\nof a machine. Given a statement with two noun\nphrases and a pronoun, the challenge of WSC is to\ndetermine the referent of the pronoun, which can\nonly be inferred from the context.\nXStoryCloze is collected by Lin et al. (2022),\nwhere the validation split of the original English\nStoryCloze dataset (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) is\ntranslated into 10 other typologically diverse lan-\nguages (RU, ZH, ES: Spanish, AR: Arabic, HI:\nHindi, ID, TE: Telugu, SW, EU: Basque, and\nMY: Burmese). Each example consists of a four-\nsentence commonsense story, a correct ending, as\nwell as a wrong ending.\n3.1 LLMs for Data Generation\nOur preliminary experiments reveal that language\nmodels that are specifically fine-tuned on down-\nstream NLP tasks, such as BLOOMZ (Scao et al.,\n2022) and Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), struggle\nto follow the complex instructions. Conversely,\nmore recent LLMs such as Dolly-v2, StableVicuna,\nChatGPT, and GPT-4, which are designed to han-\ndle more intricate and general-purpose instructions,\nhave demonstrated success in following our instruc-\ntions for data generation. ChatGPT and GPT-4 also\n673\nstand out with the capability of generating exam-\nples in non-English languages.\nWe explore synthetic data generation with\nthe four aforementioned LLMs, balancing be-\ntween open-access models and closed models (see\n§5.1). Specifically, we use dolly-v2-12b,5 which\nis derived from EleutherAI’s Pythia-12b (Bider-\nman et al., 2023) and fine-tuned on a ∼15K in-\nstructions generated by Databricks employees;\nand StableVicuna-13B, an RLHF (reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback) fine-tuned Vicuna\nmodel on various conversational and instructional\ndatasets - Vicuna is an open-source LLaMA model\n(Touvron et al., 2023a) fine-tuned on user-shared\nconversations collected from ShareGPT.6\n3.2 Instructions and Responses\nWe utilise LLMs to generate synthetic examples\nfor all datasets by prompting them. We construct\ninstructions using the descriptions from the dataset\npapers as a reference and provide LLMs with some\nexamples, randomly sampled from the train (+vali-\ndation) split of the original dataset, then ask LLMs\nto generate similar data points. We experiment\nwith various instructions and evaluate the synthe-\nsised data on a smaller scale, update the instruc-\ntions based on the errors, and then choose the best\ninstruction to generate the final datasets.\nThe final instructions and responses are in Ta-\nble 2. Our data generation process comprises the\nfollowing key steps: (1) We establish the desired\ntotal number of examples to generate. This quantity\ncan be determined by various factors such as bud-\nget constraints, a fixed ratio concerning the original\ndataset, etc. (2) We proceed to generate examples\nthrough the following iterative process: (a) To en-\nsure diversity,7 we randomly sample a set of n\nexamples from the training datasets. (b) We ap-\npend these sampled examples to the instructions\nand prompt the model to generate an additional set\nof m new examples. (c) Afterwards, we perform\npost-processing and only add valid and unique ex-\namples to the generated set. Typically, the values\nof n and m are set to 5 to 10.\nWe focus on a fixed-budget scenario and first\ngenerate a total of 3-4K data points for each dataset\nwith LLMs. LLMs tend to generate fewer samples\nthan requested or inconsistent output in invalid for-\n5Model details are included in Appendix A.\n6https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat\n7An analysis of the diversity of the generation as well as topic\ncoverage is included in Appendix B.\nModel XCOPA XWinograd XStoryCloze\nDOLLY-V2 41.6% 22.4% 41.2%\nSTABLEVICUNA 36.1% 33.8% 36.1%\nCHATGPT 86.4% 43.8% 77.6%\nGPT-4 89.7% 85.0% 89.3%\nTable 3: Generation Success Rate in English (valid\nexamples obtained / total examples requested) with dif-\nferent LLMs on the three datasets.\nmats. We report the success rate for different LLMs\non the three datasets in Table 3, which indicates\nthat GPT-4 has the most robustness.\nAmong the datasets, LLMs have the lowest gen-\neration success rate for XWinograd, which is more\nchallenging. XWinograd requires both answers\nto be from the generated sentence, with only one\npronoun being replaced. In addition, we observed\npronoun inconsistency in the generated XWinograd\ndata. Despite the requirement for interchangeable\npronouns in the options, models frequently fail to\ncomply. For example, “The dog bit the mailman\nbecause _ entered the yard.” is generated by Chat-\nGPT with the options ‘The dog‘” or “the mailman”,\nhowever, “_” in the sentence cannot be replaced by\nthe same pronoun for the given two options, hence\nit may make the task easier and the example is con-\nsidered suboptimal. We keep those instances in the\ndataset and discuss further in §6.1.\n4 Experimental Setups\nWe first generate synthetic English examples for\nXCOPA, XWinograd, and XStoryCloze, with\nDolly-v2, StableVicuna, ChatGPT, and GPT-4.\nThe size of the final filtered synthesised data for\nthe three datasets is 3.7k, 2K, and 1.7K, respec-\ntively. We then fine-tune mBERT, XLMR-base,\nand XLMR-large with the synthesised data and\ncompare the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer perfor-\nmance across different languages, where we use\nthe original validation set in target languages.\nFor XCOPA, we additionally experiment with\ngenerating data points directly in non-English lan-\nguages, by providing examples in the target lan-\nguage and specifying the language desired for the\ngenerated data (see Table 2). However, since no\nexamples for cause are included in TH and TR\ntrain/validation data (they do appear in the test\nsplit), we do not generate XCOPA for the two lan-\nguages.

For generating data with Dolly-\nv2 and StableVicuna, we use 2×40G A100.\n5 Results and Discussion\nThis section presents the main results of fine-tuned\nmodels on the three datasets and compares per-\nformance with generated data in different LLMs,\nlanguages, and scales.\n5.1 General Result\nTable 4 presents the average accuracy of fine-tuned\nmBERT, XLMR-Base, and XLMR-Large models\nacross all languages on the three datasets. The\nmodels are trained using original data (ORI), dif-\nferent LLM-generated data ( GEN), as well as a\ncombination of both sources (O+G) in English.\nAcross different datasets, LLMs, and fine-tuned\nmodels, consistent improvements are observed\nwhen using both original and LLM-generated data.\nAmong the models, Dolly-v2 performs the best\non Xingorad when fine-tuned on mBERT, while\n8In our preliminary experiments, we find that formulating\nXWinograd as a binary text classification results poorly, in line\nwith the observation from Liu et al. (2020) that the task formula-\ntion is essential to the performance of Winograd.\nGPT-4 achieves the highest accuracy in other set-\ntings. The most significant improvement is shown\nin XWinograd with XLMR-Base, where the addi-\ntion of an extra 2k datapoints leads to an average\naccuracy enhancement of 12.8 compared to the\nbaseline, across all four LLMs.\nWhen using only LLM-generated data, smaller\nmodels like mBERT and XLMR-Base generally\noutperform the baseline. However, with XLMR-\nLarge, which achieves stronger baselines. e.g. >80\nin XWinograd and XStoryCloze, the accuracy re-\nmains similar or even worse compared to using\nthe original data. GPT-4-generated data demon-\nstrates the best robustness but still experiences a\ndecline in performance in XWinograd when the\ngenerated data size is similar to the original data.\nThis highlights the challenges of generating data at\na human-level quality.\n5.2 Multilingual Data Generation\nWe investigate whether the synthetically generated\nmultilingual dataset outperforms training solely\nin English. We choose the XCOPA dataset and\nexplore two settings: synthetic multilingual data\nby asking LLMs to generate responses in the tar-\nget languages directly and translating the English-\ngenerated data to target languages with Google\nTranslate API. We exclude Dolly-v2 and Stable-\nVicuna due to their limited effectiveness in gener-\nating non-English text. Although GPT-4 exhibits\nthe most promising performance, it is significantly\ncostlier compared to ChatGPT.

We can see the impact of the generated data\nvaries across different fine-tuned models and lan-\nguages, aligning with the findings of Kumar et al.\n(2022). Training on GPT-4 synthesised data dis-\nplays consistent improvement across all scenarios\nand languages, except the zero-shot cross-lingual\nresult on HT with XLMR-Large.\nMore fluctuating results can be observed with\nChatGPT-generated data. A comparison between\nGENEN + ORI and GENXX + ORI indicates that\nutilising data generated in target languages gener-\nally leads to improved performance with GPT-4\ngenerated data, as well as in base models with\nChatGPT-generated data. However, for XLMR-\nLarge, employing ChatGPT-generated data in tar-\nget languages mostly yields negative outcomes. In\nlanguages such as TA and VI, training on gener-\nated data in the target languages results in more\nperformance degradation compared to zero-shot\ncross-lingual transfer. This suggests that ChatGPT\nperforms worse in those languages than XLMR-\nLarge (Ahuja et al., 2023).\nTranslating the English dataset generally shows\noverall better results than training on the data gener-\nated directly in the target languages, with the excep-\ntion of XLMR-Large with GPT-4. For SW, XLMR\nmodels fined-tuned with ChatGPT-generated data\nexhibit performance decline in most cases, even\nwhen the English-generated data benefits all other\nlanguages. This observation suggests that XLMR\nstruggles with SW. In §6.1 we select TA, SW, and\nthe two best languages, ID and ZH, along with EN,\nfor human evaluation.\nAdditionally, we conduct experiments adding\nTarget Languages in Validation (TLV). This only\nresults in minor variations in the performance, con-\nsistent with the findings of Ponti et al. (2020). We\ninclude the full results in Table 11 in Appendix D.\n5.3 Dataset Scaling Up\nWe now investigate the impact of training on a\nlarger scale of generated data on model perfor-\nmance.

Particularly, XLMR-Large exhibits\nthe most significant improvement.\nFurthermore, we conduct experiments on gener-\nating data with a fixed ratio of the original datasets\nand the results are included in Appendix C.\n6 Human Evaluation\nTo better evaluate the quality of the generated\ndatasets and compare them with the human-created\ndata, we ask native speakers to annotate the multi-\nlingual data generated by ChatGPT and GPT-4.\nFor each dataset, we first select 50 generated\nexamples in English, and then request two anno-\ntators to evaluate the examples in two categories:\n(1) Text Naturalness. The annotators are asked to\nchoose one of the following options for each ex-\nample: “the text sounds natural”, “the text sounds\nawkward but understandable”, or “the text is not\nunderstandable”, and (2) Logic Soundness. This\ncategory focuses on the commonsense aspect of the\nexamples. The annotators are required to select the\nmost appropriate description from: “the correct op-\ntion is (clearly) more plausible”, “both options are\nequally plausible”, “both options are implausible”,\nor “the wrong option is actually more plausible”.\nWe only ask the annotators to evaluate the logic if\nthe text is at least understandable.\nFor XWinograd, we introduce an additional eval-\nuation criterion. Annotators are asked to determine\nwhether the two noun phrases in the examples can\nbe replaced by the same pronoun (refer to §3.2).\nFor XCOPA, we extend the annotations to non-\nEnglish languages, where we choose the two lan-\nguages that demonstrate the most notable improve-\nment, namely ZH and ID, as well as the two lan-\nguages that exhibit the least improvement or regres-\nsion in performance with ChatGPT-generated data,\nnamely TA and SW (see Table 5). In addition to\nthe original examples and the generated examples\nin the target languages, we include 50 examples\nthat are translated from the same English-generated\nexamples (that were selected for annotation).\nTo ensure impartiality, all the examples are shuf-\nfled, and the annotators are not provided with in-\nformation regarding the source of the examples\n(human-created, LLM-generated, or translated).\n6.1 Text Naturalness\nFigure 1 presents the annotation results for XCOPA,\naveraged from two annotators for each language.\nFor Text Naturalness, we can see that in EN, ID,\nZH, and SW, both ChatGPT and GPT-4 achieved\nhigher naturalness than the original dataset. This is\nparticularly prominent in ID, revealing the fluency\nissue in the original ID data in XCOPA, which is\nalso confirmed by a native speaker.\nIssue with Tamil\nIn contrast, the performance of the TA dataset is\nsurprisingly low, with a majority of examples clas-\nsified as \"not understandable.\" Upon consulting\nlanguage experts, we have identified several main\nissues in Tamil, including (1) the insertion of redun-\ndant words with the same meaning, such as “I will\nretry to try it again” (2) verb agreement errors, and\n(3) the presence of uncommon and out-of-context\nwords.\nIt is worth noting that generating Tamil us-\ning GPT-4 is both slow and costly. We suspect\nthat the tokenizer for Tamil, as well as similar\nlanguages like Telugu and Kannada, are poorly\ntrained, resulting in unusable generation in those\nlanguages. While the low quality of the generated\ndata could explain the significant decline in the per-\nformance of the XLMR-Large model when trained\non ChatGPT-generated data in Tamil, intriguingly,\nmodels trained on Tamil data generated by GPT-4\nshow improvement over the baselines.\nTo further investigate this issue, we conduct an\nexperiment where we fine-tune the models using\nonly five examples from the TA examples generated\nby GPT-4 that are identified as natural and sound by\nthe annotators. The improvement on mBERT under\nthis setting is 50% of the total improvement seen\nwith the entire 3.6K TA examples. For XLMR-base\nand XLMR-large, 15% and 3% of the total improve-\nment can be observed, respectively.

Examples are annotated by two native\nspeakers in each language. The subplots in the last column show the logic issues of the XCOPA data, where the\nthree bars for each language represent Oringal, GenXX , and GenTrans\nEN (from left to right).\nthe 3.6k dataset is around 360, it is plausible that\ntraining solely on those examples could raise the\naccuracy level, or even surpass, what we observe\nfor the entire dataset.9 An intriguing question that\nremains to be investigated in future research is why\nthe remaining 3.2k incorrect or unnatural examples\ndo not negatively impact the model’s performance.\nThe translated text is typically less natural than\nthe original and generated data (apart from ID due\nto issues in the original data). This result affirms\nthat LLMs generally excel in generating fluent text\nfor the languages it supports.\n6.2 Logic Soundness\nIn terms of logic soundness, ChatGPT falls short\ncompared to the original dataset. We further illus-\ntrate the categorised issues in the last column of\nthe plots in Figure 1. We can see that for ChatGPT,\nthe majority of the examples are labelled as “both\noptions are equally plausible”, only SW has more\nproblematic examples with “the wrong option is\nactually more plausible”. We suspect that this issue\narises from the instruction provided (taken from the\ndescription of the original COPA dataset), which\nstates that “both options could be plausible, but\none is more plausible.” In some cases, ChatGPT\ngenerates two choices that are excessively similar\nin terms of plausibility. On the other hand, GPT-4\n9We could not conduct this experiment as the entire dataset\nwas not manually labelled.\ntends to generate options with more clear-cut dif-\nferences in plausibility, mirroring the original data.\nWe note that despite the description/instruction that\nboth alternatives could happen, both the original\ndataset and the data synthesised by GPT-4 tend to\npresent one plausible and one implausible option.\nFor English XWinograd and XstoryCloze, the\nmajority of the examples in both original and gener-\nated examples are evaluated as natural and logically\nsound. For XWinograd, although more than 47 ex-\namples are evaluated to exhibit high text quality\nand follow commonsense logic, only 23 ChatGPT-\ngenerated examples fulfil the requirement that both\nnoun phrases should be interchangeable with the\nsame pronoun. GPT-4 examples demonstrate better\nconsistency, with 36 following this rule, whereas\nall original examples are found satisfactory.\n7 Conclusions\nThis paper explores the effectiveness of utilis-\ning LLMs for data augmentation in cross-lingual\ndatasets with limited training data. We specifically\nfocus on commonsense reasoning tasks that are\nchallenging for data synthesis. Our experiments\nincluding four LLMs for data generation on three\ndatasets, showcase enhanced cross-lingual zero-\nshot transfer on smaller fine-tuned task-specific lan-\nguage models. However, the impact varies across\ndifferent datasets and languages. Notably, larger\nmodels such as XLMR-Large, which have higher\n678\nbaselines, demonstrate more difficulty in achieving\nperformance improvements with LLM-generated\ndata. Among the four LLMs, GPT-4-generated data\nexhibits mostly consistent superior performance.\nExpanding data generation directly in target lan-\nguages also shows general improvements com-\npared to cross-lingual zero-shot with the English-\ngenerated data. Human evaluation of the synthe-\nsised multilingual dataset shows that the ChatGPT\nand GPT-4 generated data demonstrate high natu-\nralness in most languages, even surpassing the orig-\ninal data. However, in certain languages like TA,\nboth models fail to generate natural text. Addition-\nally, when assessing the logical soundness of the\ndataset, examples synthesised by ChatGPT reveal\nnotable inconsistencies regarding more plausible\noptions compared to the original human-created\ndata. In contrast, GPT-4 exhibits a performance on\npar with human-written data.\nIn conclusion, leveraging LLMs for data aug-\nmentation shows promise. However, the choice of\nLLM used for data generation significantly influ-\nences the quality of the resulting data, as well as its\napplicability to the language under consideration.\nIn circumstances where a more advanced model\nsuch as GPT-4 cannot be accessed, other models\ncan be utilised, though this might result in perfor-\nmance difficulties in certain non-English languages\n- a challenge that also exists for GPT-4 - and con-\ncerns regarding logical coherence. A compelling\ndirection for future research could involve explor-\ning the efficacy of more recent instruction-tuned\nor aligned open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA 2\n(Touvron et al., 2023b) or TÜLU (Wu et al., 2023),\nin enhancing data augmentation.\nLimitations\nWe have identified the following limitations in this\nwork: (1)While LLMs, especially GPT-4, exhibit\npromising results in the context of multilingual\ncommonsense data augmentation, they may en-\ncounter challenges when applied to extremely low-\nresource languages. (2) In order to achieve opti-\nmal performance, few-shot examples in the target\nlanguage are still necessary for generating new ex-\namples. However, acquiring such examples may\nnot always be feasible for all languages of inter-\nest. (3) The usage of closed models like GPT-4 is\nlimited by licensing restrictions, and the results ob-\ntained from these models may not be reproducible.\nNonetheless, the experiments conducted in this\nstudy demonstrate the potential benefits of leverag-\ning LLMs for multilingual dataset augmentation.\nEthical Consideration\nSynthetic data generation with LLMs, especially\nmultilingual data, should be approached with sensi-\ntivity and respect, as it reflects the linguistic, social,\nand cultural identity of a multilingual community.\nSince LLMs are trained on web data, they may\nencode biases perpetuating stereotypes, discrimi-\nnation, or marginalisation of specific languages or\ncommunities. Therefore, collaboration with lin-\nguists, language experts, and community represen-\ntatives is necessary to avoid the unintentional per-\npetuation of stereotypes and cultural insensitivity.\nReferences\nDavid Ifeoluwa Adelani, Jade Abbott, Graham Neubig,\nDaniel D’souza, Julia Kreutzer, Constantine Lignos,\nChester Palen-Michel, Happy Buzaaba, Shruti Rijh-\nwani, Sebastian Ruder, et al. 2021.

This helps us to determine whether\nChatGPT-generated data can capture the corpus dis-\ntribution by randomly sampling n examples from\nthe dataset in the instructions.\nIn Figure 2, we present the results of compar-\ning the generated data points with the original 300\ntrain set used as few-shot examples in the gener-\nation instructions. We can see that 23 of the 30\nmost frequent events in the original dataset can\nalso be found in the 30 most frequent events of\nthe ChatGPT-generated data. Regarding the sen-\ntence length, we observe that ChatGPT tends to\n10Here we follow Mostafazadeh et al.

Specifically, we com-\npare training with the original English data (200\nrandomly selected examples) and augment it with\ndifferent quantities of English examples generated\nby GPT-4, where we include original training in-\nstances in all cases.\nThe results in Table 7 showcase the performance\non English test examples when fine-tuning mBERT\nand XLMR models with training data sizes that\nare 1 ×, 2 ×, 5 ×, and 10 × the size of the orig-\ninal dataset. We can see that performance con-\nsistently improves as we increase the amount of\ngenerated data except XStoryCloze, which has the\nhighest baselines, echoing the previous findings.\nThe relative performance gain is generally more\npronounced when increasing the data from 2× to\n5× for the other two datasets.\nD Additional Results\nThis section includes the following additional re-\nsults: Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10 show gen-\nerated data in English with different LLMs on\nXCOPA, XWinograd, and XStoryCloze.
