However, for\nthe test and characterization of power switches, coaxial current\nshunts and Rogowski coils are commonly used [3]. The coaxial\ncurrent transformer (CCT) [1], [4] is an interesting choice for\nmeasurement of the current through power devices since the\ncoaxial structure of the primary circuit leads to extremely low\ninsertion inductance. This paper analyzes the characteristics\nof the current measurement device and explains how it can be\nintegrated into a test setup for both press-mounted and module\npackages to achieve high power and high bandwidth measure-\nments. Finite-element techniques are applied to the study of\nthe CCT to obtain design information on current distribution\nin the primary and secondary circuits, flux densities, insertion\ninductance and resistance, and gain at different operating\nfrequencies.\nTwo different test setups were built—one for press-pack de-\nvices, such as MOS turn-off (MTO) thyristors [5] and the other\nfor power modules, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors\n(IGBT’s) [6]. Both setups use similar CCT structure. Analyt-\nical, numerical, and experimental results are presented in this\npaper.\nII. T\nEST SETUP D ESCRIPTION\nThe test power circuit consists of a commutation cell, which\nreproduces the transient experienced by the switching device.\nA cascade connection of two current transformers is used for\ncurrent measurement as shown in Fig. 1. The CCT is inserted\ndirectly in the power circuit. The transformer employs a\nwound-tape toroidal core. The secondary winding corresponds\nto ten turns of copper tape wound around the toroidal core.\nThe primary side of the transformer was built by machining\na toroidal shape from a solid copper bar, with the proper di-\nmensions to accommodate the transformer core and secondary\nwinding.\nA. Press-Pack Devices\nThe high-power (pulsed) test setup implemented for the\nevaluation of the resonant snubbers in current-source converter\n0093–9994/00$10.00 © 2000 IEEE\n1182 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, VOL. 36, NO.4, JULY/AUGUST 2000\nFig. 1. High-power (pulsed) test setup circuit employing MTO’s.\nFig. 2. Detail of assembly of the CCT for press-pack devices.\ntopologies is depicted in Fig. 1. MTO devices are employed in\nthe main switches (and ). A series-connected IGBT and\nfast-recovery diode are employed as the snubber switch.\nThe test circuit in Fig. 1 is capable of reproducing both\npassive and active commutation sequences with minimum\nhardware and control complexity. In this circuit, the snubber\ndriving voltage is set for optimal commutation conditions with\nthe snubber driving voltage derived from the center tap of the\ninput supply\n. Near-optimal commutation conditions can\nbe set by introducing an independent supply to set the snubber\ndriving voltage or by splitting the input voltage in multiple\nlevels [5].\nFig. 2 shows a detail of the power setup for press-pack de-\nvices illustrating the connection of the primary winding of the\nCCT to the MTO. Notice that this arrangement allows the mea-\nsurement of the current through the power device only and does\nnot include the snubber capacitor current. The current through\nthe shorted secondary winding of the coaxial transformer is\nthen measured using a commercial current transformer (Pearson\n411). The total gain of the cascade connection is 0.01 V/A (with\nthe oscilloscope at 1 M\ninput impedance).\nFig. 3. The test setup for the hard-switched voltage-source converter leg using\nIGBT modules.\nFig. 4. Details of assembly of the CCT for module package.\nB. Module Package Devices\nFor power modules like IGBT’s, the CCT is mounted directly\non the laminated bus connection to the lower IGBT emitter ter-\nminal as shown in Fig. 3. The test setup consists of one leg on a\nhard-switched voltage-source inverter. The test setup is a buck\nconverter for characterization of the IGBT module. The CCT\nis mounted on the negative dc bus, between the high-frequency\ndc capacitors and the emitter of the IGBT module, as shown in\nFig. 4. In the case of low power modules, it is possible to con-\nnect the center post of the CCT directly to the power connec-\ntions of the module. High-current high-voltage insulated gate\nbipolar transistors (HVIGBT’s) have multiple emitter and col-\nlector power connections. Using the CCT in the dc bus results\nin better symmetry in the impedance seen by the power termi-\nnals of the module. The IGBT is switched in a double-pulsed\nmanner to study the switching characteristics.\nIII. A\nNALYSIS OF CCT\nThe CCT can be simplified as long coaxial tubes for the pur-\npose of analytical investigation. The different radii of the cross-\nsection of the CCT are shown in Fig. 5. The flux linkage in\nthe CCT is calculated assuming that current flows uniformly in\nthese tubes. The thickness of the tubes is determined by the skin\ndepth at a given frequency.\nThe flux linkage of the primary winding consists of leakage\nin the center conductor, leakage in the gap between the primary\nLYRA et al.: CCT FOR TEST AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HIGH-POWER SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES 1183\nFig. 5. Details of assembly of the CCT for module package.\nand secondary, mutual flux, and leakage in the outer primary\nconductor. The mutual inductance is given by\n(1)\nwhere is the height of the CCT.\nThe leakage inductance of the primary winding can be calcu-\nlated to be\n(2)\nThe flux leakage due to the end connection in the primary\nwinding is neglected in this analysis, but is considered in the\nthree-dimensional (3-D) finite-element analysis (FEA) analysis.\nIf the secondary shields the entire core area, then there is no\nleakage inductance associated with the secondary in a coaxial\nstructure. Hence, the leakage inductance of the secondary is\nonly the parasitic inductance of the external leads. This can be\nminimized by keeping the external loop of the secondary small\nand using a sandwich of copper tape for the winding. The skin\ndepth in the windings is given by\n(3)\nThe resistance of the primary winding can be calculated using\n(4)\nThe resistance of the secondary tape is calculated ignoring the\nskin effect because its thickness is designed to be smaller than\nthe skin depth at the maximum frequency considered.\nUsing a simple model of a transformer with winding resis-\ntance, leakage inductance, and mutual inductance, we can cal-\nculate the primary current to secondary current transfer charac-\nteristics of the CCT to be\n(5)\nThe lower limit of the frequency response of the CCT is set by\nthe magnetizing inductance. The value ofcan be increased\nby using a high permeability material like “supermalloy” to im-\nprove the low-frequency response. The upper frequency limit on\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 6.

(b) Three-dimensional primary winding\nshowing current flow.\nthe measurement is determined by parasitic capacitance of the\nwindings, and shielding effect of the core used in the setup [7].\nIV . FINITE-ELEMENT A NALYSIS (FEA)\nFEA has been carried out to verify and define the design pro-\ncedures of the CCT. An eddy-current finite-element simulation\npackage is used to simulate the transformer behavior supplied\nby a high-frequency ac current.\nIn this paper, finite-element results are obtained mainly using\na two-dimensional (2-D) model for the current transformer. The\nCCT primary circuit is also simulated using 3-D FEA. The re-\nsults for the primary circuit impedance using both 2-D and 3-D\nanalysis are equivalent, indicating that using 2-D analysis is suf-\nficient in the characterization.\nThe current flow for 3-D magnetostatic analysis is shown\nin Fig. 6. As frequency increases, current flows closer to the\nconductors’ surfaces as shown in the 2-D current distribution\n1184 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, VOL. 36, NO.4, JULY/AUGUST 2000\nFig. 7.

Detail of flux lines plot for two-dimensional analysis at 400-A/50-kHz\nprimary current.\n(Fig. 7). This contributes to a more flexible transformer design\nsince it can be constructed to adapt mechanically to given test\nsetup dimensions.\nIn the coaxial structure, magnetic flux inside the primary cir-\ncuit determines the transformer insertion impedance. The cir-\nculation of current in the secondary winding creates an opposite\nflux inside the core, having a shielding effect on the space occu-\npied by the core. Two important facts arise from this shielding\neffect. Firstly, the primary impedance is reduced since the ef-\nfective loop area is reduced. Secondly, the flux level in the core\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 9. CCT insertion impedance for sinusoidal excitation. Comparison of\ntwo-dimensional FEA with magnetic and air core, and theoretical results. (a)\nComparison of resistance. Resistance at 10 MHz is 1.58 m/10 (FEA) and 1.0\nm /10 (theoretical). (b) Comparison of inductance.\nis kept low, avoiding core saturation. Fig. 8 shows the flux lines\nin the transformer for a 50-kHz primary current. It can be seen\nthat the flux lines are mainly in the space between primary and\nsecondary windings. This distribution and, therefore, the trans-\nformer parameters, vary with the input frequency.\nThe variation of primary resistance and inductance for a fre-\nquency range from 1 Hz to 10 MHz is shown in Fig. 9(a) and\n(b), respectively. At low frequencies, the core shielding effect of\nthe secondary is reduced and the primary circuit sees a high per-\nmeability flux path in the core. Also, the skin depth increases at\nlower frequency. This causes the primary impedance to increase.\nAs the frequency increases, the flux path is relocated to out-\nside the secondary winding (low permeability air) and, thus, the\nprimary inductance decreases. Primary resistance, on the other\nhand, increases with frequency as the conductor effective area\nreduces due skin effect.\nFor higher frequencies, the core could be eliminated since it\nno longer determines the flux levels in the transformer. How-\never, it is still important to assure the coupling between pri-\nmary and secondary circuits. This fact is demonstrated using\nan input current peak of 400 A and determining the ratio be-\ntween primary and secondary currents (Figs. 10 and 11).

(a) The time corresponding to the turn-on\nand turn-off point. (b) Comparison of IGBT collector current measurement\nusing an air core and magnetic core for the CCT.\nshows that ideal primary to secondary ampere–turns ratio is ob-\ntained for frequencies over 2 Hz with the magnetic core. This\nfrequency could be further reduced using higher permeability\ncore material. Without the magnetic core, the ampere–turns ratio\nis close to unity only for frequencies over 20 kHz. The gain of\nthe CCT is lower than that given by the turns ratio because the\nratio between magnetizing and secondary leakage inductance is\nsmaller in the case of the air core.\nThe transformer insertion impedance does not change for\nhigh frequencies due the core shielding effect. Fig. 9 also shows\nprimary resistance and inductance for air core transformer.\nOnly for low frequencies, the transformer parameters are\nchanged with the use of an air core.\nV. E\nXPERIMENTAL R ESULTS\nA. CCT Characterization Using IGBT Test Setup\n1) Insertion Impedance:The IGBT test setup is used to ex-\nperimentally evaluate the CCT parameters. With a fixed induc-\ntive load (225\nH), a double-pulsed gate profile is applied to the\nIGBT. The collector voltage and current transients are shown in\nFig. 12. Detail of switching transients. (a) Turn-on. (b) Turn-off.\nFig. 13. Coaxial transformer primary voltage at turn-on.\nFig. 11. The duration of the first pulse is controlled to build up\nthe desired current level in the load inductor. The turn-off char-\nacteristics can be studied under this condition. The second pulse\nis used to study the turn-on commutation. The double-pulse se-\nquence is triggered at a very low repetition rate to assure zero\ninitial conditions.\nFor evaluation of the CCT, the specific turn-on and turn-off\ntransients are indicated in Fig. 11 and expanded in Fig. 12. At\nthese instants, voltage drop across the transformer primary cir-\ncuit is measured and the transformer primary impedance is cal-\nculated. Three different tests are performed. In the first test, the\ncomplete CCT is used and the secondary current is measured.\nThis test condition is defined by the load and kept unchanged in\nall tests. In the second test, the core and secondary winding are\neliminated and the primary circuit is tested alone. Finally, only\nthe core is reinserted and the primary circuit is tested without\nthe shielding effect of the shorted secondary circuit.\nSince the load impedance mainly determines the current be-\nhavior for the first and second test, the transformer insertion in-\nductance can be evaluated using the known current variation and\nmeasuring the transformer primary voltage. Fig. 13 shows the\nCCT primary voltage transients at turn on for the three different\ncases. Without the shielding effect of the secondary winding, the\ninsertion inductance increases causing a higher primary voltage.\n1186 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, VOL. 36, NO.4, JULY/AUGUST 2000\nFig. 14. Coaxial transformer primary voltage at turn-off.\nTABLE I\nPRIMARY IMPEDANCE (AT 10 MHz FOR FEA AND THEORETICAL )\nIn the third case the core saturates causing the inductance and\ntherefore the voltage to decrease. The inductance reduces to\nonly that of the primary circuit loop if the magnetic core is elimi-\nnated. This causes reduction of the primary voltage for the same\ncurrent transient. For the complete CCT, the insertion induc-\ntance is even lower due the shielding effect of the secondary\nloop and the lowest voltage peak at turn-on is obtained. The\nsame behavior is obtained at turn-off as shown in Fig. 14. The\nprimary circuit resistance is evaluated using voltage drop and\ncurrent flow under on state after the switching transient condi-\ntions. Using the turn-on and turn-off transients, the CCT inser-\ntion impedance is calculated, and the results for each case are\nsummarized in Table I.\nThe experimental measurement of the resistance is higher be-\ncause it includes the contact resistance of the bus connections.\nThe theoretical calculation for resistance does not take into ac-\ncount the change in the current path due to the presence of the\ncore or the secondary winding. Both theoretical and FEA are\ns performed at 10 MHz. The frequency content during the ex-\nperimental measurement is different. The experimental data for\ninductance with the magnetic core and no secondary winding\ncauses the current profile in the switch to change. Hence, the\nvalue of the inductance cannot be accurately measured without\nadditional current measurement in series with the power switch.\nThe capability to measure high-frequency content due to the\nlarge di/dt (2.2 kA/\ns) is evident from Fig. 12. The measured\nrise times in the set up are of the order of 10 ns. Using\nFig. 15. Measurement using the CCT for IGBT short-circuit test.\n, one can calculate an effective upper frequency of\n30 MHz for the CCT measurements.\n2) Short-Circuit Test:A basic concern in any electromag-\nnetic measurement device is avoiding saturation of the magnetic\npath. Saturation causes errors in the measured data. The CCT\nstructure results in very low flux values inside the core. Thus,\nno magnetic saturation is expected for a wide range of input cur-\nrents.\nTo evaluate the transformer’s ability in measuring higher cur-\nrents, a short-circuit test is performed in which currents as high\nas 4000 A are allowed to flow for a short period of time. The\nIGBT collector voltage and current are plotted in Fig. 15. One\ncan observe that, even for high currents, the core does not satu-\nrate, preserving the measurement accuracy.\n3) Air Core Transformer:The importance of the magnetic\ncore in coupling the primary and secondary circuits is outlined\nwhen current is measured using an air core transformer. In this\ntopology, the same geometry of primary and secondary wind-\nings is used, but the magnetic core is replaced by an air core.\nFig. 11 shows the collector voltage transient and the measured\ncollector current for the magnetic and air core transformers. At\nthe high\ntransients, the secondary current follows the pri-\nmary current. However, after the transient, secondary current\ndecays exponentially. This means that the air core transformer\nis only capable to measure extremely high\ntransients.\nB. MTO Characterization\nThe test setup in Fig. 1 is used on the characterization of\nMTO devices. Fig. 16(a) and (b) shows measurement of the\nMTO current for turn-on and turn-off transients of switch, re-\nspectively. The high switching rates demonstrate the high band-\nwidth of the test setup. In Fig. 16(a),\nis 188 A/s and\nit is significantly higher at turn-off, before the tail current in-\nterval. An interesting characteristic also captured by the pro-\nposed current measurement scheme is the anode current peaking\nat turn-off, caused by voltage transients in the gate–cathode\njunction. Anode current peaking has been detected in similar ar-\nrangements employing regular gate-turn-off (GTO) thyristors.\nBetter utilization of the power devices is one of the main fea-\ntures of the resonant snubber structure. The placement of the\nsnubber capacitor right across the device minimizes the stray\nLYRA et al.: CCT FOR TEST AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HIGH-POWER SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES 1187\nFig. 16.

Notice the negligible voltage spike in Fig. 16(b).\nThis characteristic confirms the low insertion impedance of the\nCCT and its adequacy for measurements in very low inductance\ncircuits, such as the capture of transient device current in topolo-\ngies employing a resonant snubber.\nC. Low-Frequency Characterization\nFrom the response of the CCT shown in Fig. 10, it has gain\nof 0.83 at 2 Hz. The CCT shows onset of saturation at 0.5 Hz\nand primary current of 0.5-A rms. The CCT was tested at 60-Hz\nfrequency to obtain its gain using a large signal at low-frequency\nexcitation. Fig. 17 shows that the CCT can carry currents up to\n95-A rms at 60 Hz. The current gain is close to the ideal value\nand phase error is 4.3\nat 60 Hz.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nAn accurate current measurement technique for characteriza-\ntion of high-power semiconductor devices has been proposed\nand studied in detail. The basic component is a coaxial current\ntransformer, characterized by its low insertion resistance and in-\nductance. Analytical and computational models (2-D and 3-D)\nhave been developed and used in the determination of the CCT\nparameters and bandwidth. Experimental results confirm the\npredicted wide bandwidth and low insertion impedance of the\nproposed measurement system. Results for different types of ap-\nplications, such as laminated bus for power modules and clamps\nbus structure for press-pack setups, were presented along with\nFEA of the CCT. These results show that this easily constructed\nCCT can yield accurate results with a bandwidth from 2 Hz to\n30 MHz with very low insertion impedance.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] D. Braun, R.
