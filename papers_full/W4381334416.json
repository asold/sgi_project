  "abstract": "Computer intelligent recognition technology refers to the use of computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning and other technologies to enable computers to recognize, analyze, understand and answer human language and behavior. The common applications of computer intelligent recognition technology include image recognition, NLP, face recognition, target tracking, and other fields. NLP is a field of computer science, which involves the interaction between computers and natural languages. NLP technology can be used to process, analyze and generate natural language data, such as text, voice and image. Common NLP technology applications include language translation, emotion analysis, text classification, speech recognition and question answering system. Language model is a machine learning model, which uses a large number of text data for training to learn language patterns and relationships in text data. Although the language model has made great progress in the past few years, it still faces some challenges, including: poor semantic understanding, confusion in multilingual processing, slow language processing and other shortcomings. Therefore, in order to optimize these shortcomings, this article would study the pre-training language model based on NLP technology, which aimed at using NLP technology to optimize and improve the performance of the language model, thus optimizing the computer intelligent recognition technology. The model had a higher language understanding ability and more accurate prediction ability. In addition, the model could learn language rules and structures by using a large number of corpus, so as to better understand natural language. Through experiments, it could be known that the data size and total computing time of the traditional Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 (GPT-2) language model were 10 GB and 97 hours respectively. The data size and total computing time of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) were 12 GB and 86 hours respectively. The data size and total computing time of the pre-training language model based on NLP were 18 GB and 71 hours respectively. Obviously, the pre-training language model based on NLP had a larger data size and shorter computing time. The experimental results showed that the NLP technology could better optimize the language model and effectively improve its various capabilities. This article opened up a new development direction for computer intelligent recognition technology and provided excellent technical support for the development of language models.",
