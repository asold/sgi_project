  "abstract": "As several studies demonstrate, good sleep quality is essential for individuals’ well-being, as a lack of restoring sleep may disrupt different physical, mental, and social dimensions of health. For this reason, there is increasing interest in tools for the monitoring of sleep based on personal sensors. However, there are currently few context-aware methods to help individuals to improve their sleep quality through behavior change tips. In order to tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a system that couples machine learning algorithms and large language models to forecast the next night’s sleep quality, and to provide context-aware behavior change tips to improve sleep. In order to encourage adherence and to increase trust, our system includes the use of large language models to describe the conditions that the machine learning algorithm finds harmful to sleep health, and to explain why the behavior change tips are generated as a consequence. We develop a prototype of our system, including a smartphone application, and perform experiments with a set of users. Results show that our system’s forecast is correlated to the actual sleep quality. Moreover, a preliminary user study suggests that the use of large language models in our system is useful in increasing trust and engagement.",
