INTRODUCTION  \nPower transformer is one of the important equipment in power system. The fault in  transformer \ncauses breakdown in power system which produces financial losses to power  industry and inconvenience to \nthe end user. In power transformers, liquid insulation in the form of mineral oil/transformer oil is being used \nas cooling agent. An impregnated insulation cellulose/paper is also used as solid insulation in transformer. \nTransformer oil as liquid insulation is very important as it provides electrical insulation, dissipates heat as \ncooling agent, protect the core & winding and does isolation and moreover, prevent direct contact of \natmospheric oxygen with winding.  \nPaper insulation of winding deteriorate with time of usage which results in deterioration of solid \ninsulation [1], [2], [3]. The liquid insulation (transformer oil) when heated up due to working of transformer,   \ndecomposes and produce gases like hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4) and \nethane (C2H6). These gases deteriorate  the quality of transformer oil and further its properties as coolant and \ninsulator are affected which may result in breakdown of transformer as equipment in power supply. This can \nbe prevented by knowing the amount of gases dissolved in the transformer oil at regular intervals of time of \nusage. The conventional methods like Roger’s ratio method, Dornenburg’s method, Duval’s triangle method \nand key gas ratio methods are used to find the fault in respect of amount of harmful gases dissolved in the \ntransformer oil. But, these methods sometimes give a false fault type [4], [5]. To improve these anomalies in \nconventional methods, various software based intelligent methods such as artificial neural \nnetworks [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], Wavelet Analysis, Least Vector Quotient, Probabilistic Neural Network \n(PNN), fuzzy logic, Support Vector Machine classifiers  and Self-Organizing Map classifiers have been \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nFault detection in power transformers using random neural networks (Amrinder Kaur) \n79\nproposed to find faults in transformers, [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. As this is diagnosis process so neural \nnetwork can be applied successfully [18].   \nThis paper proposes a new ANN (Artificial neural network) based algorithm Random Neural \nNetwork to find faults in power transformers using BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) and LM \n(Levenberg-Marquardt). Further, linear regression and Bland Altman techniques are used to compare BFGS \nand LM algorithm. Also, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is used to validate the results. It has \nbeen found out that BFGS outperform the LM algorithm.  \n \n \n2. FAULT CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM APPROACH \nFollowing are the steps implemented for the proposed transformer fault classification scheme. \nThe raw data are collected from PSTCL (Punjab State Transmission Corporation Ltd.) labs and preprocessed. \nAfter that feature selection is performed so that all faults are covered in the data selected and in the last step \nof the classification, ANN (Artificial neural network) based classifiers have been applied to determine \ndifferent faults. \n \n \n3.   PROBLEM FORMULATION \n3.1. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) \nThe DGA (Dissolved Gas Analysis) is the most common techniques used for incipient fault \ndiagnosis. Oil samples are collected to perform DGA and hence gas amount in the oil sample. The level of \ngases generated in oil-filled transformer provides the first level information for fault detection in transformer \nbased on various conventional methods. Faults in oil-filled transformers can be found out according to the \namount and type of gases generated These gases are hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), ethane \n(C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Various conventional methods \ngenerally based on defined principles such as gas concentrations, key gases, key gas ratios, and graphical \nrepresentations. Under IEEE Standard C57.104- 2008 Key Gas Analysis, Dornenberg and Rogers Ratio \nMethods, Nomograph, IEC Ratio, Duval Triangle, and CIGRE Method are listed to find out faults in \ntransformers. The DGA can find faults such as partial discharge (corona), overheating, and arcing in many \ndifferent power transformers. Like a blood test in human body, DGA can provide the early diagnosis to find \nincipient faults and increase the chance of finding an appropriate maintenance schedule or repair if required. \nTable 1 shows different faults of power transformer as given by IEC/IEEE. This will be used to train RNN \nneural network to find fault in transformers. Currently seven methods based on dissolved gas data are used to \ndiagnosis types of faults:  \na. Key Gas Method,  \nb. Dornenburg Ratio Method,  \nc. Rogers Ratio Method,  \nd. Nomograph Method,  \ne. IEC Ratio Method,  \nf. Duval Triangle Method and \ng. CIGRE Method. \n \n \nTable 1.

Data collection \nThe gas samples of transformers from various substation of Punjab State Transmission Corporation \nLtd (PSTCL), Ludhiana have been used as data for analysis. The data is collected as per the American \nSociety for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. After the data collection, data is processed by removing \nlinear trends, outliers, etc. Table 2 shows the data of samples obtained from PSTCL situated in \nLudhiana.Total data collected from laboratory are 700 samples. After processing 600 samples are selected \nand100 sample per fault are used as input data. For reference only 5 samples are shown in Table 2. \n \n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 9, No. 1, February 2019 :  78 - 84 \n80\nTable 2  Samples of Data of Dissolved Gases in Powertransformers  \n \n \n \n4.  RANDOM NUERAL NETWORK \nRandom Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that could also \nbe specified as type of queuing network. The information is presented as a dataset of labeled samples. \nThe aim is “to learn” the relationship between input and output features. This learning process is done based \non a set of examples in order to generate a learning model with the power of “generalising”, this is to make \n“good” predictions for new unseen inputs. This procedure is based on the classical back propagation \nalgorithm [11]. As in practice, the input and output variables in learning problems are bounded with known \nbounds, the algorithm described in [12] assumes that a (k) ∈ [0..1]I and b (k) ∈ [0..1]O, for all sample k. \nThe RNN model as a predictor is a parametric mapping ν(a, w+, w−, L), where the parameters w+ and w− \nare adjusted minimizing the loss function. The network architecture is defined with I input nodes and O \noutput nodes. There are no additional constraints regarding the network topology that means the network can \nbe feedforward with one or several layers, or it can be recurrent network. We set the port of the input neurons \neach time that an input pattern a (k) is offered to the network. The inputs to the positive ports are set with the \ninput pattern: λ+i=a (k) i; the negative ports of input neurons are conventionally set to zero (λ−i=0). \nThe output of the model is a vector of the activity rates produced by the output neurons. The adjustable \nparameters of the mapping are the weights connections among the neurons. RNN is implemented using two \nalgorithm namely LM (Levenberg-Marquardt )and BFGS(Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithms. \n \n \n5.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nIn LM algorithm, at each epoch µ, the approximation of the Hessian matrix is given by (1). \n \n𝐻=𝐻் ∗𝐻                    (1) \n \nWhere H is hessian matrix. The dumping factor is modified at each epoch. In this case the calculated error E2 \ndecreases, then the dumping factor ɳ is calculated by some constant value β known as dumping constant \nα ← ɳ/β. Otherwise, the dumping value is increased by a factor of β, α← ɳ β. \nThe 600 data samples collected from PSTCL lab were used for training the RNN with 100 samples \nfor each fault. After 500 iterations error is reduced to 0.454 from 1038.21. The dumping constant for \nmodifying the dumping factor which is taken as 3, and β=10.  The LM algorithm calculate the weight \ncorrection as  \n \n𝛿𝑤= −𝐺×𝑔                      (2) \n \nwhere g is gradient of input funcion and G is inverse of Hessian matrix. Then, the weights are updated by δw. \nError plot as given in Figure 1.  \n BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon) Algorithm: The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno \n(BFGS) algorithm for the RNN model was proposed in 2000 by Likas and Stafylopatis [16]. It is an offline \nalgorithm. At each epoch µ approximate Hessian matrix He (τ) is computed. The method starts with Positive \ndefinite Hessian matrix, then gradient and cost function are intialised from start point. The weight correction \nis calculated by using same equation (2) as used for Levenberg-Marquardt function. Gradient and cost \nfunction is calculated and change in gradient function is given by the equation. \n \n𝛿𝑔=𝑔ଶ −𝑔              (3) \n \nUsing BFGS algorithm, after 500 iterations error is reduced to 0.166 from 1038.21.

The linear regression and Bland Altman plot are used to compare clinical methods for diagnosis. In \nlinear regression case plot between actual output and output from the proposed algorithm is plotted and gives \ncoefficient of Determination r2 and SSE denotes the Sum of square error [8]. It is an approach to model the \nrelationship between actual output and output from the proposed algorithm. Regression minimizes the sum of \nsquared differences from each point to the fitted line (or curve). \nBland-Altman plot [9] is a plot for matched pairs analysis which shows the relationship between the \ndifferences of actual and predicted output from proposed method  versus the means of the these two  outputs. \nRPC denotes reproducibility coefficient, CV is the coefficient of variation.

Each row of the matrix represents the \noutput by proposed algorithm while each column represents the actual output. Figure 5 and Figure 6 shows \nthe confusion matrix for Random Neural Network to classify different transformer fault by using LM and \nBFGS algorithms. The accuracy obtained from these algorithms are 99.33% for BFGS and 94.66% for LM. \nThese accuracies are 95.6 % for Probabilistic Neural Network classifier and 93.6 % for Backpropagation \nNetwork classifier (Levenberg–Marquardt Method) [5]. \nFor further validation of results ROC curves [10] are plotted for both the algorithms and shown in \nFigure 7 and Figure 8. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot of the true positive rate \nagainst the false positive rate for the different possible cutpoints of a diagnostic test. AUC (Area under \nCurve) is equal to the probability that an algorithm will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than \na randomly chosen negative one and is measure of test accuracy. Area under the ROC curve is 80.6% for LM \nalgorithm while for BFGs it is 80.3 %.  Table 3 shows the comparison of both algorithm based on sensitivity \nand specificity.  \n \n \n   \nFigure 5.

CONCLUSIONS \nRNN based Fault Diagnosis method (intelligent method based on AI techniques) is projected for \nfault recognition in Power Transformers. Based upon the results attained, it is concluded that \nfinding/detection of faults in Power Transformers could be efficiently done using this intelligent method. In \nthis paper, RNN is executed by using two different algorithms i.e. LM and BFGS. Both of these algorithms \nare compared by using various techniques like Regression Plots, Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve (proven \nmethods to corroborate any diagnosis test/algorithm). It is also distinguished that results from BFGS is \naugmented in comparison to LM algorithm. Moreover, memory requirement for BFGS is also less as \ncompared to LM algorithm as BFGS is a Quasi-Newton method, and will converge in fewer steps [19]. \nHence, proposed RNN with BFGS algorithm could effectually be implemented to diagnose fault in Power \nTransformers. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Jayaswal P, Verma SN, Wadhwani AK, “Application of ANN, Fuzzy Logic and Wavelet Transform in Machine \nFault Diagnosis Using Vibration Signal Analysis,” J Qual Maint Eng 16:Pp190–213, 2010. \n[2] Verma P, Singh J, Sood YR, “The Influence of Service Aging on Transformer Insulating Oil Parameters,” IEEE \nTrans Dielectr  Electr Insul, 19:Pp421–426, 2012. \n[3] Hasmat Malik, Amit Kumar Yadav, Sukumar Mishra, Tarkeshwar Mehto, “Application of Neuro-Fuzzy Scheme to \nInvestigate the Winding Insulation Paper Deterioration In Oil-Immersed Power Transformer”, Electrical Power \nand Energy Systems, 53, pp. 256–271, 2013. \n[4] Knapp GM, Jovadpour R, His-Pin Wang, “An ARTMAP Neural Network: Based Machine Condition Monitoring \nSystem,” J Qual Maint Eng, 6:Pp86–105, 2000. \n[5] Tapsi Nagpal , Yadwinder Singh Brar, “Artificial Neural Network Approaches for Fault Classification: Comparison \nand Performance”, Neural Computing and Applications , Volume 25 Issue 7-8,  \nPp 1863-1870, December 2014. \n[6] Pampa Sinha, Sudipta Debath, Swapan Kumar Goswam , “Classification of Power Quality Events Using Wavelet \nanalysis and Probabilistic neural Network”, IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence (IJ-AI), Vol. 5, \nNo. 1, pp. 1~12, 2016. \n[7] Yadaiah N, Ravi N, “Internal Fault Detection Techniques Forpower Transformers” Application of Soft Computing, \n11 Pp:5259–5269, 2011. \n[8] Bhalla D, Bansal rk, Gupta HO, “Integrating AI based DGA fault diagnosis using Dempster-Shafer Theory,” Int J \nElectr Power Energy Syst, 48:Pp 31–38, 2013. \n[9] Gardner MJ, Altman DG, “Calculating Confidence Intervals for Proportions and Their Differences”.
