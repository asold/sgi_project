The emergence of artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models \n(LLMs), surpassing human capabilities and existing algorithms in various domains, presents an opportunity to \nautomate and enhance this optimization process.\nPurpose This study seeks to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate radiotherapy treatment plans comparable \nto those crafted by human medical physicists, focusing on target volume conformity and organs-at-risk (OARs) dose \nsparing. The goal is to automate the optimization process of radiotherapy treatment plans through the utilization of \nLLMs.\nMethods Multiple LLMs were employed to adjust optimization parameters for radiotherapy treatment plans, using \na dataset comprising 35 cervical cancer patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Customized \nprompts were applied to 5 patients to tailor the LLMs, which were subsequently tested on 30 patients. Evaluation \nmetrics included target volume conformity, dose homogeneity, monitor units (MU) value, and OARs dose sparing, \ncomparing plans generated by various LLMs to manual plans.\nResults With the exception of Gemini-1.5-flash, which faced challenges due to hallucinations, Qwen-2.5-max and \nLlama-3.2 produced acceptable VMAT plans in 16.3 ± 5.0 and 9.8 ± 2.1 min, respectively, outperforming an experienced \nhuman physicist’s time cost of about 20 min. The average conformity index (CI) for Qwen-2.5-max plans, Llama-\n3.2 plans, and manual plans on the test set were 0.929 ± 0.007, 0.928 ± 0.007, and 0.926 ± 0.007, respectively. The \naverage homogeneity index (HI) was 0.058 ± 0.006, 0.059 ± 0.005, and 0.065 ± 0.006, respectively. While there was a \nsignificant difference in target volume conformity between LLM plans and manual plans, OARs dose sparing showed \nno significant variations. In lateral comparisons among different LLMs, no statistically significant differences were \nobserved in the PTV dose, OARs dose sparing, and target volume conformity between Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 \nplans.\nConclusions Through an assessment of LLM-generated plans and clinical plans in terms of target volume conformity \nand OARs dose sparing, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the viability of LLMs for optimizing \nFeasibility study of automatic radiotherapy \ntreatment planning for cervical cancer using \na large language model\nShuoyang Wei1, Ankang Hu2,3, Yongguang Liang1, Jingru Yang1, Lang Yu1, Wenbo Li1, Bo Yang1* and Jie Qiu1\nPage 2 of 13\nWei et al. Radiation Oncology           (2025) 20:77 \nIntroduction\nRadiotherapy treatment planning stands as a pivotal ele -\nment within the realm of radiotherapy procedures. A \nwell-crafted radiotherapy treatment plan is paramount in \nensuring that the planning target volume (PTV) receives \nan optimal radiation dose while simultaneously mini -\nmizing exposure to surrounding organs at risk (OARs). \nCrafting such a plan poses an intricate optimization \nconundrum with multiple conflicting objectives [ 1–6]. \nTraditionally, medical physicists rely on a labor-intensive \ntrial-and-error methodology to iteratively fine-tune opti -\nmization parameters, such as the dose goals for differ -\nent OARs, to achieve an acceptable treatment plan. This \nconventional process is not only time-consuming but also \ncomputationally intensive, leading to inefficiencies in the \ntreatment planning workflow [7–10].\nTo enhance the efficiency of treatment planning, \nresearchers have proposed diverse methodologies, \nincluding automated rule implementation and reason -\ning (ARIR), knowledge-based planning (KBP), and multi-\ncriteria optimization (MCO). ARIR employs pre-set rules \nwithin the treatment planning system (TPS) to automate \nbeam setup and optimize treatment plans based on dose-\nvolume histograms (DVH) [11, 12]. KBP involves creating \na repository of plans serving as templates for various can-\ncer types, allowing for the identification of the most anal-\nogous plan for a new case, thereby reducing the requisite \nnumber of iterations [ 13–15]. In the MCO approach, \nphysicists simultaneously generate multiple anchor \nplans, each optimizing a single DVH criterion of an OAR \nto achieve optimal sparing without compromising PTV \ndosimetric criteria, forming a Pareto surface with a spec -\ntrum of optimal plans across different dosimetric criteria. \nThis approach allows physicists to navigate through vari -\nous Pareto-optimal plans to select the most suitable one \nbased on their preferences [ 16–18]. MCO has been suc -\ncessfully implemented in TPS such as RayStation (RaySe-\narch, Stockholm, Sweden) and Eclipse (Varian, Palo Alto, \nUSA).\nWith the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), novel ave-\nnues for efficient treatment planning have emerged. One \nnotable approach involves leveraging AI to predict flu -\nence maps, convertible into multi-leaf collimator (MLC) \nsequences for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) \nplans using tools like the Eclipse scripting API (ESAPI) \n[19, 20]. For VMAT plans, researchers predict dose distri-\nbutions from CT images and input them into the TPS for \nfurther optimization [ 21, 22]. McIntosh et al. proposed \na voxel-based dose mimicking algorithm to convert the \npredicted dose distribution to a complete treatment plan, \nachieving a fully automated treatment planning [23–26].\nSeeking further automation, researchers have explored \nreinforcement learning techniques [27, 28]. Some studies \nhave utilized neural networks to generate and adjust opti-\nmization parameters iteratively, enhancing plan optimi -\nzation efficiency [ 29]. Reinforcement learning networks \nhave been integrated into TPS, allowing for the genera -\ntion of machine-executable plans directly [ 30, 31]. How-\never, training neural networks for reinforcement learning \ndemands substantial data and computational resources, \nadditionally, a separate network must be trained for each \nspecific cancer type, presenting challenges for clinical \napplication [32].\nLarge language models (LLMs) have found broad appli-\ncations across diverse domains, including radiotherapy. \nWhile LLMs have facilitated knowledge dissemination \nto patients and aided in medical record documentation, \ntheir potential in radiotherapy physics remains under -\nexplored [ 33–39]. Some researchers have studied the \nrole of LLM in dose prediction. Dong et al. proposed \nDoseGNN for dose prediction, in which LLM was used \nto process prescription information to enhance network \nperformance [ 40]. During radiotherapy treatment plan -\nning, physicists evaluate dosimetric parameters provided \nby the TPS to adjust optimization parameters. Current \nLLMs possess analysis and reasoning capabilities and are \ntrained by a large number of standard corpora, allowing \nthem to be customized to master some skills with mini -\nmal data. Therefore, LLMs can be attempted to perform \niterative optimization of radiotherapy plans to improve \nthe automation of the optimization process with a small \namount of training data. Liu et al. attempted to use LLM \nto optimize treatment plans for prostate cancer, showing \nthe potential of LLM [32].\nIn this study, we investigated the feasibility of leverag -\ning LLMs for automating radiotherapy treatment plan -\nning, focusing on cervical cancer plans. By utilizing \nmulti-modality LLMs to evaluate and adjust plans itera -\ntively, we aim to assess the efficacy of LLMs in optimiz -\ning treatment plans compared to manual optimization by \nexperienced physicists.\nMaterials and methods\nResearch framework\nThe research framework for this study is illustrated \nin Fig.  1. To optimize treatment planning using LLM, \nwe developed a virtual plan designer utilizing multi-\nmodal LLM. This system is capable of evaluating plans \nradiotherapy treatment plans. The implementation of LLMs demonstrates the potential for enhancing clinical \nworkflows and reducing the workload associated with treatment planning.\nKeywords Radiotherapy, Treatment planning, Large language model, Automation\nPage 3 of 13\nWei et al. Radiation Oncology           (2025) 20:77 \nand adjusting optimization parameters. Following each \noptimization iteration, dosimetric parameters for the \nPTV and OARs are input into the LLM for assessment. \nAdjusted optimization parameters are then generated \nbased on this evaluation and fed back into the TPS for \nsubsequent iterations until the PTV and OARs dose cri -\nteria are met.\nDataset\nThe dataset comprises 35 cervical cancer patients who \nunderwent VMAT at our hospital between September \n2023 and August 2024. Patients with cervical cancer were \nincluded, the upper boundary of the PTV was below \nthe kidney, and those with lymph node metastasis were \nexcluded. OARs considered in the study encompassed \nthe bladder, small intestine, rectum, bone marrow, spi -\nnal cord, as well as the left and right femoral heads. Each \npatient’s data included CT images delineating the PTV \nand OARs, along with clinically approved manual plans.\nAccording to our preliminary research, it takes less \nthan 5 patient cases to customize an LLM. In this study, \n5 of the 35 patients were allocated to the training set for \ncustomizing LLMs in radiotherapy treatment planning. \nThe remaining 30 patients constituted the test set, where \nLLM autonomously conducted treatment planning. To \nassess the generalization ability of LLMs in generating \nradiotherapy plans with varying target locations, two \npatients with PTVs extending to the inguinal region were \nincluded in the test set.\nThe prescribed dose for the PTV in cervical cancer was \n36.0 Gy (1.8 Gy per fraction × 20 fractions), covering 95% \nof the PTV. A coplanar two-arc VMAT plan with gantry \nangles ranging from 0° to 360° was employed for the cer -\nvical cancer plans.\nTPS and plan optimization\nIn this work, the treatment plan optimization and dose \ncalculation were performed using uTPS (United Imag -\ning Healthcare Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Upon OARs \ndelineation, auxiliary structures including R2 (expand \nPTV by 0.5 cm and create a ring of 2.5 cm), R3 (expand \nPTV by 1.0  cm and create a ring of 2.0  cm), and R4 \n(expand PTV by 1.5 cm and create a ring of 1.5 cm) were \ncreated to aid in plan generation. Plan templates were \ncustomized via the clinical protocol manager in uTPS, \nwith initial plan objectives empirically set based on his -\ntorical plan metrics and clinical expertise.\nVarious optimization objectives such as maximum \ndose, minimum dose, DVH (Dose-Volume Histogram) \nparameters, and mean dose were selected in uTPS. Dur -\ning optimization, dose goals for OARs were adjusted \nwhile maintaining consistent weights. Plan objectives \nfor target volumes, OARs, and auxiliary structures along \nwith their initial dose goals are detailed in Table 1.\nAfter each iteration, uTPS could provide a “constraint \ntarget value” based on the gap between the dose goal and \nthe current dose for each optimization objective. The \nconstraint target value is expressed in scientific notation \nand ranges from [0.00E + 0, +∞]. The smaller the value, \nthe closer the current dose is to the dose goal, indicating \nthat this optimization objective is not strictly limited.\nIn the clinical planning process, on the premise of not \naffecting the target volume conformity, it is generally \nbelieved that when the constraint target value is between \n1.00E-2 and 5.00E-2, the optimization objectives of the \nsmall intestine, rectum, and bladder will be strictly lim -\nited. For other OARs, to avoid overly strict restrictions, \nresulting in poor target volume conformity or high dose \nof important OARs like small intestine, it is generally \nFig. 1 The workflow of using LLM for radiotherapy treatment planning\n \nPage 4 of 13\nWei et al. Radiation Oncology           (2025) 20:77 \nconsidered that when the constraint target value is \nbetween 1.00E-4 and 1.00E-2, the degree of restriction is \nappropriate. This criterion provides a reference for plan -\nning optimization using LLMs.\nIn this study, the photon energy was set at 6MV. The \ncollimator angles of the two arcs were both set at 0°. The \nFluence Map Optimization (FMO) algorithm was used \nfor VMAT treatment plan optimization [ 41]. For dose \ncalculation, the collapsed cone algorithm was used with \na dose calculation grid of 2 mm [ 42]. In the optimization \nprocess, two terminating criteria were introduced for the \noptimization iteration: [1] A maximum iteration number \nof 20 was reached; [ 2] Once the PTV dose is greater than \nthe prescription dose and the constraint target values of \nOARs are in their ideal ranges.\nLLMs and prompt engineering\nSeveral LLMs were utilized as virtual physicists for plan \noptimization, including Qwen-2.5-Max (Alibaba cloud, \nHangzhou, China), Gemini-1.5-Flash (Google, Mountain \nView, CA), and Llama-3.2 (Meta AI, Menlo Park, CA). \nParameters fed into the LLMs comprised current doses, \ndose goals, constraint target values, ideal ranges of con -\nstraint target values for OAR optimization objectives, \nand PTV D95 values.\nIn our clinical practice, the prescription dose is speci -\nfied using the PTV D95 metric. For the cases in this \nstudy, the prescribed dose for the PTV D95 is 3600 cGy. \nAccording to clinical practice, to optimize the dose dis -\ntribution while avoiding excessive hot spots or cold \nspots, we initially set a PTV D95 target between 1.00 \nand 1.02 times the prescribed dose. This approach allows \nfor greater flexibility in achieving optimal dose confor -\nmity and coverage while preventing substantial devia -\ntions from the prescribed dose. Following the initial \noptimization, we perform dose normalization to adjust \nthe PTV D95 to exactly 3600 cGy.\nDuring customization, we first introduced the main \ngoal of this task to LLM, which was to increase the PTV \ndose greater than the prescription while keeping the \nconstraint target value of OARs within the ideal inter -\nval. Subsequently, the adjustment strategy was intro -\nduced, that is, when the constraint target value is greater \nthan/less than its ideal range, the dose goal should be \nincreased/decreased, while if the constraint target value \nis 0, the dose goal should be adjusted to less than the \ncurrent dose. In supplementary material, we describe \nin detail the specific methods of LLM customization \nthrough prompt engineering, as well as the inputs and \noutputs of LLM in the planning optimization of a sample \ncase. For 5 patients in the training set, after each itera -\ntion, we input the dosimetric parameters of PTV and \nOARs to LLM, allowing it to conduct evaluation and \nadjust plan objectives. We then provided the LLM with \nthe evaluation opinions of human physicists and the \nadjustment scheme, enabling the LLMs to gradually mas-\nter the decision-making process of human physicists. For \nthe test set patients, adjusted objectives from LLMs were \ndirectly input into uTPS for optimization without manual \nintervention, until the terminating criteria were met.\nTo enhance LLMs’ adaptive capabilities, prior adjust -\nment strategies and dosimetric parameter changes \nwere considered before each optimization objective \nassessment.\nPlanning evaluation\nClinical plans were developed and approved for all \npatients by experienced medical physicists using uTPS \nthrough inverse optimization. We collected these clini -\ncal plans as the benchmark to verify the feasibility of \nusing LLM to optimize radiotherapy plans. All plans were \nnormalized to ensure that 95% of PTV coverage met the \nprescription dose. Target volume conformity, OARs dose \nsparing, and Monitor Unit (MU) values were calculated \nand compared between clinical and LLM plans.\nTarget volume conformity was assessed using the Pad -\ndick conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI). \nCI value and HI value were defined as Eqs.  ( 1) and ( 2), \nrespectively.\n \nCI = TVRI × TVRI\nVRI × TV  (1)\n \nHI = D2% − D98%\nD50%\n (2)\nIn Eq. (1), VRI and TV represent the volume of the refer -\nence isodose cloud and the volume of the target, respec -\ntively. TVRI represents the intersection of VRI and TV.

A CI \nvalue of approximately 1 indicates better conformity. The \ncloser the HI value is to 0, the better the uniformity of the \ntarget volume. OARs dose sparing was evaluated using \nvarious dosimetric parameters detailed in Table 2.\nTo verify the clinical deliverability of the LLM plans, we \nperformed patient-specific quality assurance on all LLM \nplans and manual plans using Third QA software (United \nImaging Healthcare Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), which \nhas been clinically validated.\nStatistical analyses were conducted using the Wilcoxon \nsigned-rank test with a significance set at P < 0.05 using \nSPSS version 29.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) [43].\nResults\nPlan generation results and iteration time\nAll generated LLM plans underwent evaluation by \nthree senior medical physicists. All plans generated by \nQwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 were deemed clinically \nacceptable for all 30 patients in the test set. However, \nGemini-1.5-flash exhibited issues, with only the first two \nplans meeting the acceptability criteria. In the remaining \n28 patients, Gemini-1.5-flash displayed hallucinations, \nconfusing OARs dose sparing across iterations and fab -\nricating data for analysis. Additionally, it occasionally \ndeviated from evaluation criteria, leading to counter -\nproductive optimization adjustments or no adjustments, \nimpeding its ability to generate clinically acceptable plans \nfor some patients.\nRegarding iteration time, uTPS required approxi -\nmately 56 s per iteration, while Qwen-2.5-max, Gemini-\n1.5-flash, and Llama-3.2 took around 30, 12, and 6  s, \nrespectively, for a single processing and output adjust -\nment cycle. For the test set, automatic planning took on \naverage 16.3 ± 5.0  min and 9.8 ± 2.1  min for Qwen-2.5-\nmax and Llama-3.2, respectively, compared to approxi -\nmately 20 min for manual planning in our hospital. The \nLLM-based method demonstrated faster plan generation \nspeed than manual methods, with Qwen-2.5-max averag-\ning 10.6 ± 3.5 iterations and Llama-3.2 averaging 8.5 ± 2.0 \niterations for plan optimization.\nTreatment planning performance between LLM plans and \nmanual plans\nAll manual plans and LLM plans by Qwen-2.5-max and \nLlama-3.2 met clinical prescription requirements for tar -\nget coverage. Table  3; Fig.  2 provide a quantitative com -\nparison between manual plans and LLM plans in terms \nof PTV dose, OARs dose sparing, target volume confor -\nmity, dose homogeneity, and MU values. Comparative \nanalyses between manual plans and LLM plans revealed \nthat Gemini-1.5-flash plans exhibited suboptimal per -\nformance due to hallucinations leading to misguided \noptimization directions. That is, when the restriction on \none OAR in the current plan is strict enough, Gemini-\n1.5-flash would further limit its dose, and as the limita -\ntions of the current plan for an OAR tended to become \nnonexistent, Gemini-1.5-flash would further relax the \nlimitations until they became nonexistent.

As a \nresult, Gemini-1.5-flash plans showed compromised tar -\nget conformity, dose homogeneity, and maximum dose \ncontrol compared to other methods. The CI value was \nsignificantly lower than that of manual plans, and the \nmaximum dose of the target volume was higher than that \nof plans made by other methods, as shown in Fig. 2.\nIn terms of OARs dose sparing, Qwen-2.5-max and \nLlama-3.2 plans showed no significant differences from \nmanual plans in most dosimetric parameters. In most \ncases, the bladder D50 values for LLM and manual plans \nwere comparable. However, one outlier case exhibited a \nsignificant difference, with the bladder D50 in the LLM \nplan being approximately 6  Gy higher than in the man -\nual plan. This outlier contributed to the higher average \nbladder D50 value observed for LLM plans in Table  3; \nFig. 2. In terms of the maximum dose in the target vol -\nume, the average maximum dose of Qwen-2.5-max and \nLlama-3.2 were lower than those of manual plans. Nota -\nbly, Llama-3.2 demonstrated a statistically significant \nadvantage in maximum dose control within the target \nvolume. Furthermore, Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 \nplans exhibited significantly improved HI values and \nlower MU values compared to manual plans, indicating \nenhanced target volume conformity, dose homogeneity, \nand reduced complexity.\nFigure 3 shows the isodose distribution of the manual \nplan, Qwen-2.5-max plan, and Llama-3.2 plan in three \ndifferent slices of one sample patient. It can be found that \nin this case, there is no obvious difference in the target \ncoverage across these three plans, with faster dose fall-\noff in the bladder and rectum areas in LLM plans. Fig -\nure 4 shows the comparison of dose-volume histograms \nbetween different plans of this patient, which are (a) \nmanual plan and Qwen-2.5-max plan, and (b) manual \nplan and Llama-3.2 plan. It can be seen that doses to the \nrectum and bladder in these two LLM plans are lower, \nand the target volume conformity of LLM plans is better.\nTo verify the feasibility of using LLM to optimize radio-\ntherapy treatment plans for different patients, we com -\npared OARs dose sparing between manual plans and \nLLM plans generated by Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 \nfor 30 test patients. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the \nFig. 3 Isodose distribution of three slices from a sample patient’s plans\n \nPage 9 of 13\nWei et al.

The results revealed notable \nadvantages in PTV Dmax, Bladder D50, Small Intestine \nD50, and Bone Marrow D90 with LLMs outperforming \nmanual plans.\nOverall, cervical cancer radiotherapy plans generated \nby Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 closely matched manual \nplans in OARs dose sparing, with superior target volume \nconformity and dose homogeneity. This preliminarily val-\nidates the feasibility of utilizing LLM for cervical cancer \ntreatment planning.\nRegarding the results of patient-specific quality assur -\nance, when the evaluation criteria are set at 3  mm/3%, \nthe gamma passing rate for all plans exceeds 0.999. \nWhen the criteria are tightened to 2 mm/2%, the gamma \npassing rate for manually optimized plans is greater than \n0.99, whereas the gamma passing rate for LLM plans is \ngreater than 0.995. This indicates that the LLM plans \nexhibit excellent deliverability. Table 4 presents the mean \ngamma passing rates of plans obtained by different meth-\nods under various criteria.\nHorizontal comparison across different LLMs\nTo further compare the differences in the plans gener -\nated by different LLMs, we calculated the relative differ -\nences in dosimetric parameters between plans generated \nby Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2, as shown in Table  5. It \ncan be found that the relative differences between plans \ngenerated by these two LLMs were minimal, with aver -\nage relative differences of less than 3% for PTV dose and \nOARs dose sparing, showing no statistical significance. \nDespite significantly lower MU values in Llama-3.2 plans, \nthe mean difference between the two LLMs was only 8.7 \nMU, indicating effective treatment planning and accept -\nable plan generation capability across different LLMs \n(Table 5).\nTable 4 Gamma passing rates of manual plans and LLM plans \nunder different criteria\nCriteria Manual \nplans\nQwen-2.5-Max Llama-3.2 Gemini-1.5-\nFlash\n3 mm/3% 0.999 ± 0.001 1.000 ± 0.000 1.000 ± 0.000 1.000 ± 0.000\n2 mm/2% 0.995 ± 0.007 0.999 ± 0.001 0.999 ± 0.001 0.999 ± 0.001\nFig. 5 Difference distributions between manual plan and different LLM plans on test set, ( a) dosimetric parameters, ( b) target volume conformity and \ndose homogeneity\n \nFig. 4 Comparison of dose-volume histograms between manual plan and different LLM plans (dashed line)\n \nPage 10 of 13\nWei et al. Radiation Oncology           (2025) 20:77 \nDiscussion\nThis study delved into the feasibility of leveraging large \nlanguage models for optimizing radiotherapy treatment \nplans. The findings revealed that Gemini-1.5-flash strug -\ngled to produce clinically acceptable plans due to halluci -\nnation effects, while both Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 \nsuccessfully generated such plans. Concerning OARs \ndose sparing, neither the Qwen-2.5-max nor Llama-3.2 \nplans exhibited statistically significant discrepancies from \nmanual plans. Across the test set, the average D50 values \nfor the small intestine and rectum in the Qwen-2.5-max \nand Llama-3.2 plans were marginally lower than those in \nmanual plans. However, for the bladder’s D50 and spinal \ncord’s D0.1 cc, manual plans slightly outperformed LLM \nplans, with the bladder D50 averaging 0.5–0.6 Gy lower \nand the spinal cord D0.1 cc 0.5–0.8 Gy lower. Studies by \nOkonogi [ 44] and Jadon [ 45] suggest that a 0.5 Gy dose \nvariation may not lead to distinct clinical outcomes for \nthe small intestine, rectum, and bladder. Moreover, a \nspinal cord D0.1  cc of 20  Gy typically does not induce \nsignificant spinal cord injury [ 46]. Thus, the differences \nin OARs dose sparing between LLM plans and manual \nplans are not substantial.\nIn this study, we compared the dose differences \nobserved in our research with findings from previous \nstudies. Kang et al. reported no significant differences \nbetween KBP and manual plans in terms of PTV D2%, \nD98%, and conformity index, though a significant reduc -\ntion in the homogeneity index was observed in KBP \nplans. Regarding OAR dose sparing, KBP reduced doses \nfor most OARs, except for the small intestine and the \nleft femoral head [ 47]. Similarly, Swamidas et al. found \nthat KBP achieved comparable target coverage to man -\nual plans while significantly reducing doses to the spinal \ncord and femoral heads [ 48]. Compared to these KBP-\nbased methods, the LLM-based method in our study \ndemonstrated advantages in CI and HI. Regarding OAR \ndose sparing, the LLM plans resulted in lower doses to \nthe small intestine and rectum than the manual plans. \nThese findings highlight the potential of LLMs in auto -\nmatic treatment planning. In future research, we plan \nto explore a variety of other treatment planning meth -\nods, including knowledge-based planning (KBP), and \ncompare the dose differences among plans generated by \ndifferent approaches. This will provide a more compre -\nhensive evaluation of the performance of the LLM-based \nmethod and its potential applications in clinical practice.\nThe initial plan objectives were established by senior \nmedical physicists based on their clinical expertise in this \nstudy. The application of these uniform initial objectives \nenhanced plan optimization efficiency, yielding accept -\nable results in under 20 iterations across the test set, even \nin cases with inguinal targets, in which the initial dose \ngoal might be too strict for femoral heads. Specifically, \nthe initial dose objective for the mean dose to the femo -\nral heads was set at 2000 cGy. For typical cervical cancer \nplans, this dose objective is relatively close to the dose \nultimately achieved. During the optimization process, \nonly a few adjustments were typically required to bring \nthe constraint target value into the ideal range. How -\never, for patients with inguinal targets, the mean dose \nto the femoral heads may reach 2300 to 2400 cGy. Con -\nsequently, in the initial iterations, the constraint target \nvalue was relatively high, often exceeding 1.00E-1. While \nsuch a large deviation from the ideal range is uncommon \nin other typical plans, the LLM in this study effectively \novercame this challenge by making substantial initial \nadjustments, followed by gradual reductions in adjust -\nment amplitude. This approach allowed the femoral head \nconstraint target value to reach the ideal range after only \na few iterations.\nFor all patients in the test set, Llama-3.2 required \nfewer than 11 iterations, and Qwen-2.5-max fewer than \n18 iterations, demonstrating the method’s adaptability \nfor various PTV and OARs locations. Unlike existing AI \nmethods employing dose prediction and reinforcement \nlearning, this approach utilizes fixed initial objectives \nTable 5 Comparison of dosimetric parameters between plans by Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2\nStructures Metrics Qwen-2.5-max Llama-3.2 Mean relative difference p-value\nPTV Dmax 38.33 ± 0.42 38.37 ± 0.28 0.10% 0.489\nD98 35.51 ± 0.05 35.50 ± 0.05 -0.02% 0.303\nBladder D50 30.87 ± 2.15 30.91 ± 2.47 -0.10% 0.277\nSmall Intestine D50 14.25 ± 3.34 14.26 ± 3.55 0.32% 0.762\nRectum D50 34.12 ± 2.59 34.22 ± 2.45 0.06% 0.720\nBone marrow D90 12.03 ± 1.93 12.23 ± 1.71 2.16% 0.095\nSpinal cord D0.1 cc 20.38 ± 2.44 20.72 ± 1.73 2.09% 0.208\nFemoral head left D5 27.20 ± 2.37 27.22 ± 2.03 0.25% 0.847\nFemoral head right D5 26.66 ± 2.05 26.89 ± 2.13 0.87% 0.167\nCI 0.929 ± 0.007 0.928 ± 0.007 -0.15% 0.083\nHI 0.058 ± 0.006 0.059 ± 0.005 3.79% 0.136\nMU 812.65 ± 66.27 803.95 ± 63.21 -1.04% 0.048\nPage 11 of 13\nWei et al.

The models \nautonomously adapt the adjustment amplitude of dose \ngoals based on feedback, ensuring convergence towards \nthe ideal constraint target value. In this study, since the \ninitial objectives for most OARs were not strictly lim -\nited, after the first few iterations, the constraint target \nvalue of some OARs was usually too small or even zero. \nIn this scenario, LLM adjusted the dose goal by a large \namplitude (for example, 100  cGy). When the constraint \ntarget value was gradually approaching its ideal range, \nLLM detected this trend without human intervention \nand actively reduced the adjustment amplitude of the \ndose objective (such as 50 cGy and 20 cGy) until the con -\nstraint target value reached the ideal range. In the follow-\ning research, we aim to explore the potential for further \nrefinement by allowing the LLM to independently assess \nthe potential for optimization based on dose distribution \nand other relevant information, rather than relying solely \non empirical rules. This approach will enable the LLM \nto make autonomous decisions regarding dose objective \nadjustments, potentially leading to improved solutions.\nNotably, Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 outperformed \nGemini-1.5-flash in this study, as they effectively inter -\npreted input data and generated reasonable outputs. \nConversely, Gemini-1.5-flash exhibited hallucinations, \nignored provided iteration results, and occasionally mis -\njudged adjustment directions, leading to subpar perfor -\nmance. The occurrence of hallucinations in LLMs, as \nnoted by Lee et al., may result from excessive repetitive \ninformation biasing the model’s knowledge memory \n[49]. In our study, standardized input specifications and \nprompts might contribute to hallucination issues. Beyond \nthat, the hallucination of LLM may also be caused by fac -\ntors such as model structure, model size, and decoding \nalgorithm [50, 51].\nThe relatively large model sizes of Qwen-2.5-max and \nLlama-3.2 pose challenges for integration and deploy -\nment within clinical TPS. Future research should explore \nemploying smaller LLM models for iterative radiother -\napy treatment plan optimization. Additionally, investi -\ngating more effective prompts, incorporating Retrieval \nAugmented Generation (RAG) technology [ 52–54], or \nexperimenting with Controlled Text Generation (CTG) \nmethods [ 55, 56] could also be explored to enhance the \nreliability of utilizing smaller LLMs to adjust plan optimi-\nzation parameters.\nIn subsequent studies, we will try to leverage LLMs to \noptimize radiotherapy plans for diverse tumor sites and \nintegrate LLMs with TPS to expand their applicability in \nradiotherapy plan optimization, ultimately enhancing the \nautomation of radiotherapy treatment planning.\nConclusion\nThis study delved into the feasibility of employing large \nlanguage models for automated radiotherapy treatment \nplanning, utilizing various LLMs. Comparative analy -\nsis between LLM-generated plans and manual plans \nrevealed that Qwen-2.5-max and Llama-3.2 effectively \ncrafted clinically acceptable cervical cancer plans based \non provided prompts. Notably, the LLM-based method \nexhibited a lower time cost for plan generation compared \nto the manual method. Regarding dosimetric parameters, \nno significant disparities were observed in PTV dose \nand OARs dose sparing between LLM plans and manual \nplans. LLM plans showcased superior target volume con -\nformity relative to manual plans. In essence, this study \noffers initial validation for leveraging LLMs in automat -\ning treatment planning for cervical cancer. By supplant -\ning manual planning, the LLM-based approach has the \npotential to alleviate physicists’ workload and stream -\nline their processes, thereby augmenting overall clinical \nefficiency.\nAbbreviations\nLLM  Large Language Models\nOAR  Organ-at-risk\nVMAT  Volumetric modulated arc therapy\nMU  Monitor unit\nCI  Conformity index\nHI  Homogeneity index\nPTV  Planning target volume\nARIR  Automated rule implementation and reasoning\nKBP  Knowledge-based planning\nMCO  Multi-criteria optimization\nTPS  Treatment planning system\nDVH  Dose-volume histogram\nAI  Artificial intelligence\nMLC  Multi-leaf collimator\nIMRT  Intensity modulated radiotherapy\nESAPI  Eclipse scripting API\nFMO  Fluence Map Optimization\nD5  Dose covering 5% of the volume\nD50  Dose covering 50% of the volume\nD90  Dose covering 90% of the volume\nD98  Dose covering 98% of the volume\nD0.1cc  Dose covering 0.1 cc of the volume\nRAG  Retrieval Augmented Generation\nCTG  Controlled Text Generation\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at  h t t p  s : /  / d o i  . o  r \ng /  1 0 .  1 1 8 6  / s  1 3 0 1 4 - 0 2 5 - 0 2 6 6 0 - 5.\nSupplementary Material 1\nAuthor contributions\nPaper idea: Shuoyang Wei, Ankang Hu, Bo Yang.
