    "abstract": "Analyzing the concentration of low molecular acids dissolved in oil is vital in the oil-paper insulation aging diagnostic procedure of power transformers. The existing methods cannot distinguish between different acid types and their strengths. In this study, an improved solution Raman detection platform is fabricated. The direct measurement of dissolved acetic acid, a kind of low molecular acids, is observed in transformer oil without extraction. The Raman shift line of oil-dissolved acetic acid at 891 cm−1 corresponding to H–C–H symmetrical swing and O–H swing modes is taken as its characteristic value. Taking Raman shift line of pure oil at 932 cm−1 as an internal standard, a linear regression curve for quantitative analysis is obtained with a slope of 0.19. The best platform parameter of accumulation number is 300, which is determined by Allan deviation analysis. The current concentration detection limit and accuracy for oil-dissolved acetic acid are obtained at about 0.68 mg/mL and 91.66%, separately. The results show that Raman spectroscopy could be a useful alternative method for evaluation insulation aging state of an operating power transformer in the future.",
