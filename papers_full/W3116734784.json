INTRODUCTION\nThe large power transformer is one of the very important \ncomponents in a complex electrical power system, for which \nvarious types of the protection system and the monitoring \nscheme have been developed over the years. A power \ntransformer is a most expensive electrical power device and its \noperation dire ctly affects the performance of the other \nequipment connected to it [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to use \nan efficient protection scheme and the monitoring system to \nensure its physical integrity, as well as a long time for the \noperating life. The protect ion system for the power \ntransformers is a critical phenomenon. Traditionally, a \nmethods for the power transformer protection that uses its \nterminal behavior based on a differential protection is \nconsidered to be the very widely used technique for the \nperforming of protection functions [1]. The protection method \nfor the power transformer should avoid and block the \ndifferential relay tripping phenomenon during magnetizing \ninrush and should rapidly operate its tripping during internal \nfaults. \nA scheme of differential protection can be used to protect the \nprimary and secondary windings of the three -phase power \ntransformer against faults phenomena. This method is basically \nbased on the difference between the error and other operating \nconditions [1]. As an essential result if choose a proper scheme \nof identification which can discriminate and distinguishes the \nmagnetizing inrush and internal fault current while a new \npower transformer is being installed by electrical power \ncompanies. The fundamenta l principle of operating the \ndifferential protection for power transformer is based on \ncomparison of the primary and secondary winding of the \ncurrents transformer. If any unbalance encountered in between \nprimary and secondary currents, the relay will actuate and inter \ntrip both the circuit breaker on side of primary and secondary \nthat installed and become an integral part of the power \ntransformer [1]. \nProtection system using the protection relay is a set of \nequipment in a particular circuit that functions as a response to \na faults that occur in the electrical power system [2]. Protection \nrelay system automatically as a driver for circuit breaker (CBs) \noperation, needs to adjust the protection relay [3]. The opening \noperation of the CBs for isolation or relea se of parts of the \nsystem is interrupted, so as not to impact other parts of the \nelectrical power system without interruption, very closely \nrelated to the performance of the CBs [2, 4]. Schematic \ndiagram of a simple circuit of a protection system with \ninstalling the protection relay is shown in Figure 1. \nThe principle of differential relay operation is based on (i) \ncomparison of current vectors between  I1 and I2 or between i1 \nand i2, (ii) the CT1 and CT2 must be ratios such that the value \nof i1= i2, and (iii) the connection of the polarity of CT1 and CT2 \nmust be correct.

Schematic diagram of differential relay placement \n \nBased on Figure 2, the calculation of the current detected \nby the differential relay per phase and the restraining currents \n[5-7], as discussed in Eqns. (1) and (2). \n \n𝒊𝒅 = |𝒊𝟏 − 𝒊𝟐| = 0 (1) \n \n𝒊𝒓 =\n|𝒊𝟏| + |𝒊𝟐|\n𝟐  (2) \n \nThe values of id, i1, i2, and ir are the form of vector quantities. \nBased on Eq. (1), differential relay is not activated, if the fault \nthat occur on outside the protection zone of power transformer \n[8]. Related to currents detected by differential relays [9, 10] \nto changes in the protection of transformer power, such as the \nconversion in Eq. (3). \n \n𝒊𝒅 = |𝒊𝟏 + 𝒊𝟐| (3) \n \nwhere, id≠0. \nBased on Eq. (3), the differential relay operates, if there is a \nfault in the protection zone of the power transformer. The \nfaults in the protection zone of the power transformer result in \nthe appearance of characteristic differences between  CT1 and \nCT2, furthermore these differences result in the onset of \ncurrent imbalances. \nUtilization of protection relay for anticipation of different \nconditions based on electric current has been implemented in \nelectric power systems since the late 19 -th century [8] and is \none of the first protection systems ever used [11]. Detection of \ndifferent conditions is done by comparing the current flowing \nin and out of the protected object [5, 6, 12, 13], in this case is \nthe power transformer. Faults in power transformers are \ndivided into two types, namely external and internal faults \n[14]. Faults ori ginating from external, including overvoltage, \noverfluxing, lessfrequency, and short circuit fault outside of \nthe transformer [15, 16]. Internal faults on power transformers \nare events with probabilities ranging from 70 -80% [15, 16] \nwhich are distinguished  by two types of faults, namely (a) \ninitial disruption (incipient faults) and (b) short circuit \ninterruptions occur in transformers [14, 17, 18]. Initial \ndisruptions include i) the existence of an arc, ii) the presence \nof a disturbance in the cooling syste m, and/or iii) there is a \ncirculating current in the transformers that are operated in \nparallel. The three faults included in the initial disturbance are \nthe cause of the existence of local heating, but do not affect the \noverall transformer temperature [ 19]. These faults cannot be \ndetected from the transformer winding connection, because \nthe value and balance of current and voltage that occur are not \nmuch different from the condition when the power transformer \nis operated under normal conditions [16]. \nThe o bjectives for measurement of differential relay \nperformance are carried out through (a) simulation of loading \nphenomenon on the power transformer, (b) simulation of fault \nphenomenon on outside the protection zone, and (c) simulation \nof fault phenomenon on inside the protection zone of power \ntransformer. The fault condition is chosen as three-phase short \ncircuit fault phenomena and given an input voltage value of \n380 volts (phase to phase ), so that the primary current value \nentering the transformer is obtained. The power transformer is \nused as an object with selected capacity is amounting to 60 \nMVA and an impedance value of 12.34% or 0.1234 per unit \n(p.u.) that copied from the nameplate. \n \n \n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n \nThe relay differential used for the protection system is a unit \ntype with a specific equipment zone. Only in the case of a fault \ninternal to the protection zone will the difference between the \ninput and output currents be high. However, the differential \ncurrents can sometimes be significant even though wit hout \ninternal faults [9]. This is due to certain characteristics of \ncurrent transformers with different saturation levels or \nnonlinearities for measuring the input and output currents. The \npower transformer is protected with the exception of inrush \ncurrent and over current excitation and most of the other \nproblems, can be solved by using percent differential relay that \nadded to the normal differential relay with two restraining \ncoils fed by the zone-through currents [9].  \nInstallation of the percent differe ntial relay is carried out \nwith (i) proper choice of the resulting percent differential \ncharacteristic and (ii) proper connection of the current \ntransformers on both side of the power transformer. The \ndifferential protective relays with percentage restrain t have \nbeen in service for many years [9, 20]. Currents of an operating \nand a restraining were compared by the differential elements \n[9]. Differential relays in a good perform for external faults, as long as \nthe CTs is reproducing the primary current correctly. When one of \nthe CTs on saturate condition or if both of CTs saturate with \ndifferent levels, then the false operating current appears in the \ndifferential relay, so could cause relay on mal-operation [9]. \nThe types of faults that occur based on the pro tection zone, \nnamely the faults for outside and inside of the protection zone \n[8]. Schematic diagram of the existence of faults on inside the \nprotection zone against the power transformers is shown in \nFigure 3. \n444\n \nCT1 CT2I1 I2\ni1 i2\nPower Transformer\nl\no\na\nd\ns\nid\ns\no\nu\nr\nc\ne\nprotection area\nCircuit \nBreakers \n(CBs)\nDifferential \nRelay (DR)\nCT= Current Transformer\ni1 i1\ni2\ni2\nid = i1 – i2\nCircuit \nBreakers \n(CBs)\nfault\n \n \nFigure 3.

Schematic diagram of the existence of faults on \noutside the protection zone against the power transformer \n \nDifferential relays are selective relays, so that if a fault occur \non the protected object inside its protection zone, the relay \noperates, whereas if a fault occur outside the protection zone \nfor protected object, the relay does not operate [8]. With regard \nto the selective nature, the differential relay is the main \nprotection that does not need to be coordinated with the other \ntypes of relays. The response shown by the differential relay is \nvery fast and no time delay is needed [ 13]. The relationship \nbetween input and output currents in the current transformer [8, \n13] is shown in Figure 5. \nBased on Figure 5 is shown, that the things that influence the \nexistence of 𝑖𝑢𝑏, namely (i) the characteristics of the magnetic \ncurvature of CT1 and CT2, especially in large short -circuit \ncurrents and the secondary currents are no longer linear to the \nprimary current due to CTs saturation; (ii) the CT1 and CT2 load; \nand (iii) the presence of dc components at short circuit times. \nThe dc component accelerates CT saturation. The existence of \nthe iub is then a percentage differential relay, which is a relay \nwith operating characteristics following the likelihood of iub [8, \n13]. Based on these characteristics, if there is an external \n(“through fault”) with a large current and an iub, the relay does \nnot operate [7, 21]. Thus, the spill current must be greater than \na definite percentage of the “through fault” current for relay to \noperate. Hence, the name percentage differential relay [5]. \nOperating characteristics of percentage differential relay [5] \nare shown in Figure 6. \n \nCT1\nCT2ideal\ni1,i2\nI1,I2\ni1\ni2\niub = i1-i2\n \n \nFigure 5. The relationship between input and output currents \nin the current transformer \n \n \n \nFigure 6. Operating characteristics of percentage differential \nrelay \n \nBased on Figure 6 can be explained, that the curve \nrelationship between “through fault” and the stability ratio of \nthe percentage differential relay is substantially better than the \nsimple differ ential relay [5]. The minimum pick -up (g) is \nintended to anticipate a number of circumstances, namely (i) \ncurrent imbalances, (ii) imbalances between Auxiliary CTs \nused, (iii) magnetization currents, and (iv) changes in power \ntransformer ratios due to oper ation of the on load tap changer \n[22]. \nThe slope of the relay is usually expressed as a percentage, \nthus a slope of 0.25 is expressed as 25% slope. The percentage \ndifferential relay does not have a fixed pick -up value. The \nrelay automatically adapts its pick -up value to the “through \nfault” current. As the “through fault” current goes on \nincreasing, it is in effect asking the relay to take it easy, by \nintroducing a restraining torque proportional to the circulating \ncurrent. The restraining winding is also known as the biasing \nwinding, because bias the relay towards restraint. The slope of \nthe characteristic is also known as percentage bias. The \ncharacteristic of the percentage differential relay \nsuperimposed on the “through fault” characteristic, and the \ninternal fault characteristic are shown in Figure 6 [5].  \nThe slope of the internal fault characteristic can be found \nbased on consider an internal fault in the case of a single-end-\n445\n \nfed system. Since CT2 will not contribute any current, i.e. 𝐼2 = \n0, the spill current (𝐼1 − 𝐼2) will be equal to 𝐼1. The circulating \ncurrent wihich is ( 𝐼1 − 𝐼2)/2 will be equal to 𝐼1 2⁄ . Thus, the \nfollowing currents will exist during an internal fault, i.e. spill \ncurrent equal to 𝐼1 and circulating current equal to 𝐼1 2⁄ . Thus, \nduring internal faults the spill current will be two times the \ncirculating current, giving a slope of 2, which is expressed as \n200%. The minimum internal fault current below which the \nscheme will no t respond is seen to be If, min. int.  Thus, the \nstability ratio is If, max. ext.  divided by If, min. int.  The percentage \ndifferential relay can be made more ummune to mal-operation \non “through fault” by increasing the slope of the characteristic \n[5]. \nSchematic diagram of the completeness structure of the oil \nimmersed transformer, as shown in Figure 7. \n \n \nSource: Engineering360 (power by IEEE GlobalSpec.): \nhttps://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/120090/11000kV-Wires-vs-11000kV-to-\n220V-Transformer \n \nFigure 7. Schematic diagram of the completeness structure \nof the oil immersed transformer \n \nBased on Figure 7 can be explained, that the capacity factor \nor power transformer rating is not the only determinant in the \nchoice of protection equipment. Faults in the power \ntransformer and transformer vector groups, are also the \ndetermining factors in the choice of protection equipment. \nThe existence of power transformers in each substation \nplays a very important role, so it is said to be the heart of the \nlink between the transmission line and the distribution network \n[3]. Guided by the IEC 60076 -1 standard it is said, that the \npower transformer is a static electrical device with two or more \nturns with the process of electromagnetic induction, changing \nthe voltage and alternating current system into a voltage and \ncurrent system with other values which are usually of different \nvalues and at the same frequency value for the purpose of \ntransmitting electric power [11, 23]. Power transformers have \nbeen grouped into three market segments based on power size \nranges [24], namely (i) small power transformers (500 to 7,500 \nkVA), (ii) medium power transformers (7,500 kVA to 100 \nMVA), and (iii) large power transformers (greater than 100 \nMVA). \n \n \n3.

The values of current based on the results of \nmeasurement by providing a simulation in the form of the \nloading phenomenon on the power transformer \n \nSide of 150 kV \nCurrent before Aux.CT Tap-A Current after Aux.CT Tap-A \n𝐼𝑅 = 165.2 mA 𝐼𝑅 = 195.6 mA \n𝐼𝑆 = 165.2 mA 𝐼𝑆 = 199.2 mA \n𝐼𝑇 = 199 mA 𝐼𝑇 = 188.2 mA \nSide of 20 kV \nCurrent before Aux.CT Tap-B Current after Aux.CT Tap-B \n𝐼𝑅 = 198 mA 𝐼𝑅 = 198.2 mA \n𝐼𝑆 = 190.4 mA 𝐼𝑆 = 202 mA \n𝐼𝑇 = 193.3 mA 𝐼𝑇 = 191.7 mA \nInrush current to differential relay: \nPhase-R= 2.6 mA; Phase-S = 2.8 mA; Phase-T= 3.5 mA. \nSetting current: 3.5 + (30% ∙ 3.5) = 4.45 mA \n \nBased on Table 1 is shown, that the values of current based \non the results of measurement is under the owner authority.  \nThe setting current for the differential relay is based on the \nlargest measurement value of each current per measured phase, \nso that the setting current (𝐼𝑠𝑒𝑡.) is obtained of 3.5 + (30% ∙ 3.5) \n= 4.45 mA. When the loading phenomenon of the current \nentering the differential relay is mutually reduced, because the \ndirection of the current vector produced in the simulation is \nopposite. The value of the setting current does not affect the \noperation of the differential relay, because the value of the \ncurrent entering the differential relay is no more than the \nsetting current of 130% of the largest measured current in each \nphase. \n \n4.2 Fault phenomenon on outside the protection zone \n \nThe measurement of differential relay performance by \ngranting fault phenomenon on outside the protection zone, is \nthe measurement of performance by simulating no fault occur \nwithin the differential relay. Th e results of current \nmeasurement before Aux.CT, is the current generated from the \nratio of CT1 and CT2. The current produced by CT needs to be \nbalanced, so Aux.CT is needed. Based on Aux.CT, the value \nof the current entering the differential relay becomes balanced. \nThe values of current based on the results of measurement by \nproviding a simulation in the form of the fault phenomenon on \noutside the protection zone is shown in Table 2. \nBased on Table 2 is shown, that the current value of the \nmeasurement results is under the authority. The measurement \nresults are different from the results of calculations, because \nthe measuring instruments used with certain sensitivity, \nresulting in different values. The provision of disturbance \nconditions outside the protected area results in the value of the \ncurrent entering the relay being mutually reduced, because the \ndirection of the current vector produced in this simulation is \nopposite, so the resulting reduction is zero. The reality of the \nresults from measurements in the field is not equal to zero, so \nthere is a tolerance value of the measuring instrument. There \nis a percentage error in the measurement results ranging from \n2.782324% to 3.618421%. \n \nTable 2. The values of current based on the results of \nmeasurement by providing a simulation in the form of the \nfault phenomenon on outside the protection zone \n \nSide of 150 kV \nCurrent before Aux.CT Tap-A Current after Aux.CT Tap-A \n𝐼𝑅 = 53.4 mA 𝐼𝑅 = 64.8 mA \n𝐼𝑆 = 52.5 mA 𝐼𝑆 = 61.1 mA \n𝐼𝑇 =56.6 mA 𝐼𝑇 = 60.8 mA \nSide of 20 kV \nCurrent before Aux.CT Tap-B Current after Aux.CT Tap-B \n𝐼𝑅 = 59.3 mA 𝐼𝑅 = 62.9 mA \n𝐼𝑆 = 56.7 mA 𝐼𝑆 = 62.8 mA \n𝐼𝑇 = 59.3 mA 𝐼𝑇 = 63.0 mA \nUsed Eq.

(6), namely: \na) The output current from 𝐶𝑇1  before entering Aux.CT \nTap-A on the 150 kV side is \n4\n𝛼 =\n300\n5 , then 𝛼 =\n4∙5\n300 = 0.066, in \norder to obtain a current value of 66 mA; \nb) The output current from 𝐶𝑇1 after exiting Aux.CT Tap-A \non the 150 kV side is  \n66\n𝛼 =\n43\n29, in the presence of the Aux.CT \nTap-A output in the form of a delta relationship, then \nmultiplied by √3, so that a current value of around 𝛼 =\n66∙29\n43 ∙\n√3 = 77.09 mA is obtained; \nc) The output current from 𝐶𝑇2  before entering Aux.CT \nTap-B on the 20 kV side is \n30\n𝛼 =\n2,000\n5 , then 𝛼 =\n30∙5\n2,000 = 0.075, \nin order to obtain a current value of = 75 mA; and \nd) The output current from 𝐶𝑇2 after exiting Aux.CT Tap-B \non the 20 kV side is \n75\n𝛼 =\n43\n25, in the presence of the Aux.CT \nTap-B output in the form of a delta relationship, it is multiplied \nby √3, so that a current rating of 𝛼 =\n75∙25\n43 ∙ √3= 75.52 mA is \nobtained. \nThe values of current based on the results of calculation by \nproviding a simulation in the form of the fault phenomenon on \noutside the protection zone is shown in Table 3. \nBased on Table 3 is shown, the inrush current to the \ndifferential relay calculation results in the provision of fault \nconditions outside the protected area is calculated by Eq. (1), \nobtained |77.09 − 75.52| = 1.57 mA. \n448\n \nResults of the measurements of current that inrush to the \ndifferential relay when providing fault phenomenon on outside \nof the protection zone is should be zero, but the measurement \nresults are obtained (i) 1.9 mA at phase-R, there is a difference \nin the measurement resu lts of 3.020668%; (ii) 1.7 mA at \nphase-S, there is a difference in the measurement results of \n2.782324%; and (iii) 2.2 mA at phase -T, there is a difference \nin the measurement results of 3.618421%. Results of the \ncalculation of current inrush to the differential relay should be \nzero, but the calculation results are obtained of each phase are \n1.57 mA, so that each phase there is a difference of 2.078919%. \n \nTable 3.

The currents generated from 𝐶𝑇1 and 𝐶𝑇2 need to be \nbalanced, so Aux.CT Tap -A and Aux.CT Tap -B are needed. \nBased on Aux.CT Tap-A and Aux.CT Tap-B, the value of the \ncurrent entering the differential relay becomes balanced. The \nvalues of current based on the results of measurement by \nproviding a simulation in the form of the fault phenomenon on \ninside the protection zone is shown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4. The values of current based on the results of \nmeasurement by providing a simulation in the form of the \nfault phenomenon on inside the protection zone \n \nSide of 150 kV \nCurrent before Aux.CT Tap-A Current after Aux.CT Tap-A \n𝐼𝑅 = 53.4 mA 𝐼𝑅 = 64.8 mA \n𝐼𝑆 = 52.5 mA 𝐼𝑆 = 61.1 mA \n𝐼𝑇 = 56.6 mA 𝐼𝑇 = 60.8 mA \nSide of 20 kV \nCurrent before Aux.CT Tap-B Current after Aux.CT Tap-B \n𝐼𝑅 = 59.3 mA 𝐼𝑅 = 62.9 mA \n𝐼𝑆 = 56.7 mA 𝐼𝑆 = 62.8 mA \n𝐼𝑇 = 59.3 mA 𝐼𝑇 = 63.0 mA \nUsed Eq. (3), inrush current to differential relay: \nPhase-R= |64.8 + 62.9| = 127.7 mA; Phase -S = |61.1 + 62.8| = \n123.9 mA; Phase-T= |60.8 + 63.0| = 123.8 mA. \nPercentage error: 2,078919% \n \nBased on Table 4 is shown, that the current value of the \nmeasurement results is under the authority. The measurement \nresults are different from the results of calculations, because \nthe measuring instruments used with certain sensitivity, \nresulting in different values. Giving the fault condition inside \nthe protection zone, the resulting value of the current entering \nthe relay is a sum, because the direction of the current vector \nproduced in this simulation is unidirectional, so the sum of \ninrush current obta ined is not equal to zero. That impacts on \ndifferential relays that can operate. \nThe calculation process is explained in the following \ndescription by using Eqns. (6) and (7). Sequence of calculation \nphases as in the simulation of giving the fault condition  for \noutside the protected zone of power transformer, so the results \nof the calculation are as shown in Table 2. Based on Table 3, \ninrush current to differential relay is calculated by Eq. (3), \nobtained at |77.09 +  75.52| = 152.61 mA. \nResults of the measurem ents of current that inrush to the \ndifferential relay when providing fault phenomenon on inside \nthe protected zone is the sum of inrush current not equal to \nzero and obtained are 127.7 mA at phase -R, 123.9 mA at \nphase-S, 123.8 mA at phase -T, while the resu lts of the \ncalculation of the inrush current to the differential relay of \neach phase of 152.61 mA. The value should not be equal to \nzero, so it is according to the condition, that the differential \nrelay operates because the value of the inrush current to t he \ndifferential relay is not equal to zero and is greater than the \nsetting current value. \n \n \n5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION \n \nBased on the results and discussions, conclusions can be \ndrawn according to the research objectives. In the loading \nphenomenon of the current entering the differential relay is \nmutually reduced, because the direction of the current vector \nproduced in the simulation is opposite. The value of the setting \ncurrent does not affect the operation of the differential relay, \nbecause the value of the current entering the differential relay \nis no more than the setting current of 130% of the largest \nmeasured current in each phase. \nWhen providing fault phenomenon on outside of the \nprotection zone is should be zero, but the measurement results \nare obtained (i) 1.9 mA at phase-R, there is a difference in the \nmeasurement results of 3.020668%; (ii) 1.7 mA at phase -S, \nthere is a difference in the measurement results of 2.782324%; \nand (iii) 2.2 mA at phase -T, there is a difference in the \nmeasurement results of 3.618421%. Results of the calculation \nof current inrush to the differential relay should be zero, but \nthe calculation results are obtained of each phase are 1.57 mA, \nso that each phase there is a difference of 2.078919%. \nWhen providing fault phenomenon on inside the protected \nzone is the sum of inrush current not equal to zero and obtained \nare 127.7 mA at phase -R, 123.9 mA at phase -S, 123.8 mA at \nphase-T, while the results of the calculation of the inrush \ncurrent to the differential rel ay of each phase of 152.61 mA. \nThe value should not be equal to zero, so it is according to the \ncondition, that the differential relay operates because the value \nof the inrush current to the differential relay is not equal to zero \nand is greater than the setting current value. \nTo complete the conclusion, recommendations for future \nwork which related to the measurement of differential relay \nperformance in power transformers can be added. This \nresearch methods can be implemented for various capacity \nvalues, v oltage systems, and the impedance values of the \npower transformer. \n  \n449\n \nREFERENCES  \n \n[1] Kainth, H.S., Sharma, G.
