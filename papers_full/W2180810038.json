Enterprise architecture advocates for model-based decision-\nmaking on enterprise-wide information system issues. In order to provide\ndecision-making support, enterprise architecture models should not only\nbe descriptive but also enable analysis. This paper presents a software\ntool, currently under development, for the evaluation of enterprise ar-\nchitecture models. In particular, the paper focuses on how to encode\nscientiﬁc theories so that they can be used for model-based analysis and\nreasoning under uncertainty. The tool architecture is described, and a\ncase study shows how the tool supports the process of enterprise archi-\ntecture analysis.\nKeywords: Enterprise Architecture, Probabilistic relational Models,\nSoftware tool, Security Analysis.\n1 Introduction\nOver the last two decades, enterprise architecture has grown into an established\napproach for holistic management of information systems in organizations [1,2].\nA number of enterprise architecture initiatives have been proposed, such as The\nOpen Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) [3], the Zachman Framework\n[4], and military architectural frameworks such as DoDAF [5] and NAF [6].\nThe core concept of the enterprise architecture approach is the employment of\nmodels, in terms of diagrammatic descriptions of information systems and their\nenvironment. Diagrammatic descriptions of IT systems and their environment\nare heavily used. However, enterprise a rchitecture models are not limited to\ndescriptive use only, but can also be employed to predict the behavior and eﬀects\nof decisions. Rather than modifying enterprise information systems using trial\nand error, models allow predictions about the behavior of future architectures.\nOne prominent challenge to rational decision making is uncertainty. Therefore,\na good enterprise architecture model sh ould be able to capt ure uncertainties\nabout assessment theory, system conﬁguration or data quality, thus providing\nbetter decision support and risk management.\nP. Soﬀer and E. Proper (Eds.): CAiSE Forum 2010, LNBIP 72, pp. 108–121, 2010.\nc⃝ Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010\nA Tool for Enterprise Architecture Analysis 109\nWhat constitutes a “good” enterprise architecture model is dependent on its\npurpose, i.e. the type of analysis it is intended to support [7]. For instance\nin the case of analyzing cyber security, t he property of whether it is possible\nto reconﬁgure a ﬁrewall is of i nterest. This property however, is irrelevant for\na number of other analyses, such as performance evaluation or data quality\nanalysis.\nSeveral enterprise architecture software tools are available on the market,\nincluding Metis [8], System Architect [9] and Aris [10]. These tools generally\nfocus on the modeling of an architecture whereas the analysis functionality is\ngenerally limited to performing an inventory or to sum costs over the modeled\narchitecture. None of the mentioned tools has signiﬁcant capabilities for system\nquality analysis based on an elaborated theory. Furthermore, these tools do not\nsupport the consideration of uncertainty as described above.\nIn this paper an enterprise architecture software tool is presented. This tool\ndoes not only provide functionality to model enterprise architectures, but also\nsupports the analysis of them. In order to support enterprise architecture analysis\nas it has been outlined in [7] the tool consists of two main components. In the\nﬁrst component the theory relevant to analyze a certain system quality, such as\ndata quality or modiﬁability, is modeled. One can consider this as the deﬁnition\nof a language tailored to describe a certainaspect, e.g. cyber security. The second\ncomponent supports the application of thetheory to evaluate a speciﬁc enterprise\narchitecture. This is done by modeling the “as-is” or “to-be” architecture of the\nenterprise. Based on the created models it is possible to determine how the\narchitecture fulﬁlls the requirements as they have been deﬁned in the theory. The\ntwo-component architecture encourages the reuse of the developed theory as it is\npossible to use the same language to describe several architecture instances. The\npresented tool makes use of the Probabilistic Relation Models (PRM) formalism\nas it has been presented in [11] and can thereby manage the uncertainty aspects\ndiscussed above.\n2 Enterprise Architecture Analysis\nEnterprise architecture models serve se veral purposes. Kurpjuweit and Win-\nter [12] identify three distinct modeling purposes with regard to information\nsystems, viz. (i) documentation and communication, (ii) analysis and explana-\ntion and (iii) design. The present article focuses on the analysis and explanation\n(which is not to denigrate the usefulness of the others). The reason is that analy-\nsis and explanation are closely related to the notion of propergoals for enterprise\narchitecture eﬀorts. For example, a business goal of decreasing downtime costs\nimmediately leads to an analysis interest in availability. This, in turn, deﬁnes\nthe modeling needs, e.g. the need to collect data on mean times to failure and\nrepair. In this sense, analysis is at the core of making rational decisions about\ninformation systems [7] [13]. An analysis -centric process of enterprise architec-\nture is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the ﬁrst step, assessment scoping, the problem is\ndescribed in terms of one or a set of potential future scenarios of the enterprise\n110 M.

The process of enterprise architecture an alysis with three main activities: (i)\nsetting the goal, (ii) collecting evidence and (iii) performing the analysis\nand in terms of the assessment criteria with its theory (the PRM in the ﬁgure)\nto be used for scenario evaluation. In thesecond step, the scenarios are detailed\nby a process of evidence collection, resulting in a model (instantiated PRM, in\nthe ﬁgure) for each scenario. In the ﬁnal step, analysis, quantitative values of\nthe models’ quality attributes are calculated and the results are then visualized\nin the form of e.g. enterprise architecture diagrams.\nMore concretely, assume that a decision maker in an electric utility is contem-\nplating changes related to the conﬁguration of a substation. The modiﬁcation of\na new access control policy would reduce the probability that someone installs\nmalware on a system and thereby reduce the risk that this type of unwanted\nsoftware is executed. The question for the decision maker is whether this change\nis feasible or not.\nAs mentioned in the ﬁrst stepassessment scoping the decision maker identiﬁes\nthe available decision alternatives, i.e. the enterprise information system scenar-\nios. In this step, the decision maker a lso needs to determine how the scenario\nshould be evaluated, i.e. the goal of the assessment. One such goal could be to\nassess the security [14] of an information system. Other goals could be to assess\nthe availability [15], interoperability [16] or data quality [17] [18] of the proposed\nto-be architecture. Often several quality attributes are desirable goals. In this\npaper, without loss of generality, we simplify the problem to the assessment of\nsecurity of an electric powerstation.\nInformation about the involved systems and their organizational context is\nrequired for a good understanding of their data quality. For instance, it is rea-\nsonable to believe that a ﬁrewall would increase the probability that the system\nis secure. The availability of the ﬁrewall is thus one factor that can aﬀect the\nsecurity and should therefore be reco rded in the scenario model. The decision\nmaker needs to understand what information to gather and also ensure that this\ninformation is indeed collected and modeled. Overall, the eﬀort aims to under-\nstand which attributes causally inﬂuence the selected goal, viz. data quality. It\nmight happen that the attributes identiﬁed do not directly inﬂuence the goal. If\nso, an iterative approach can be employed to identify further attributes causally\naﬀecting the attributes found in the previous iteration. This iterative process\nA Tool for Enterprise Architecture Analysis 111\nGoal\nAttributeAttribute AttributeAttribute\nGoal\nAttributeAttribute AttributeAttribute\nGoal\nAttributeAttribute AttributeAttribute AttributeAttribute\nGoal selection Goal decomposition \niteration\nGoal decomposition \nresult\nIndirectly \ncontrollable\nDirectly \ncontrollable\nFig. 2. Goal decomposition method, from [19]\ncontinues until all paths of attributes and causal relations between them, have\nbeen broken down into attributes that are directly controllable for the decision\nm a k e r[ 1 9 ]( c f .F i g .2 ) .\nIn the second step collecting evidence the scenarios need to be detailed with\nactual information to facilitate their analysis of them. Thus, once the appropriate\nattributes have been set, the corresponding data is collected throughout the\norganization. In particular, it should be noted here that the collected data will\nnot be perfect. Rather, it risks being incomplete and uncertain. The tool handles\nthis by allowing the user to enter the credibility of the evidence depending on\nhow large the deviations from the true value are judged to be.\nIn the third and ﬁnal step, performing the analysis, the decision alternatives\nare analyzed with respect to the goal set e.g. security. The mathematical for-\nmalism to be presented in section 2.1 plays a vital role in this analysis. Using\nconditional probabilities and Bayes’ rule, it is possible to infer the values of the\nvariables in the goal decomposition under d iﬀerent architecture scenarios [20].\nBy using the PRM formalism, the architecture analysis accounts for two kinds of\npotential uncertainties: that of the attribute values as well as that of the causal\nrelations as such. Using this analysis framework, the pros and cons of the scenar-\nios can be weighted against each other in order to determine which alternative\nought to be preferred.\n2.1 Probabilistic Relational Models\nA probabilistic relational model(PRM) [21] speciﬁes a template for a probability\ndistribution over an architecture model. The template describes the metamodel\nfor the architecture model, and the probabilistic dependencies between attributes\nof the architecture objects. A PRM, together with an instantiated architecture\nmodel of speciﬁc objects and relations, deﬁnes a probability distribution over\nthe attributes of the objects. The probability distribution can be used to infer\nthe values of unknown attributes, given evidence of the values of a set of known\nattributes. PRMs are related to Bayesian Networks. As it is succinctly put in\n[11], PRMs “are to Bayesian networks as relational logic is to propositional logic”.\nA PRM model may be instantiated as arelational skeleton, σ\nr , containing ob-\njects, object relationships, and attributes. Furthermore, aqualitative dependency\n112 M. Buschle et al.\nstructure S deﬁnes the details of the attribute relationships, i.e. the sets of prob-\nabilistic parents inﬂuencing each attribute. Finally, the PRM is completed by the\nset of parameters θ\nS specifying the full conditional probabilistic dependencies\nbetween attributes in the form of numbers in Conditional Probability Matrices\n(CPM). The following expression thus deﬁnes the conditional probability of an\ninstance I,g i v e nσ\nr , S,a n dθS:\nP (I|σr, S,θ S)=\n∏\nx∈σr\n∏\nA∈A(x) P(Ix.A|IPa(x.A))\n=\n∏\nXi\n∏\nA∈A(Xi)\n∏\nx∈σr(Xi) P(Ix.A|IPa(x.A) )\nCompared to the standard chain rule for Bayesian networks, this equation is\ndiﬀerent in three ways: (i) the random variables are the attributes of a set of\nobjects, (ii) the parents of a random variable depend on the model context of\nthe object, and (iii) the parameters are shared between the attributes of objects\nin the same class. In other words, the variables in the dependency structure are\nthe properties of the objects in the inst antiated information model, and their\ncausal relations are expressed by the CPM [11].\nA PRM thus constitutes a formal machinery for calculating the probabilities\nof various architecture instantiations. This allows us to infer the probability that\na certain attribute assumes aspeciﬁc value, given some (possibly incomplete) ev-\nidence of the rest of the architecture instantiation. In addition to expressing and\ninferring uncertainty about attribute values as speciﬁed above, PRMs also pro-\nvide support for specifying uncertainty about the structure of the instantiations.\nPRMs additionally allow specializing classes through inheritance relation-\nships. Classes can be related to eac h other using the subclass relation ≺,a n d\neach class X is associated with aﬁnite set of subclasses C[X]. So ifZ,Y ∈ C[X],\nboth Z and Y are subclasses of X.I f Z ≺ Y then Z is a subclass of Y ,a n dv i c e\nversa Y is a superclass of Z. A subclass Z always contains all dependencies and\nattributes of its superclassY . PRMs also allow the dependencies and conditional\nprobability distributions of inherited attributes to be specialized in subclasses.\n3 Architecture of the Tool\nThe presented tool is implemented in Java and is based on a Model-View-\nController architecture [22] [23]. Where the model represents the knowledge and\nconsidered data that in this case are PRM and instantiated PRM respectively.\nThe implementation contains a mapping of the PRM structure to JAVA-classes.\nThereby each part of a PRM (e.g. PRM-classes, their attributes, and their rela-\ntions) can be used and combined as regular JAVA-objects. The view is in charge\nof the visualization of the model for the tool user. It presents the considered data\nin an understandable way. The view is updated as soon as the model changes.\nFinally the controller links the user to the application making the program react\non the users input. Changes of the model are perforemd via the controller that\nacts as an interface in this case. Thereby a decoupling of data access, program\nlogic, data presentation, and user interaction can be ensured. This facilitates the\nA Tool for Enterprise Architecture Analysis 113\nCASTOR\nJava\nPRM\nJava\nCM\nGetter/Setter\nUn-/Marshall\nGetter/Setter\nUn-/Marshall\nVIEW\niPRMView\nPRMView\niPRMScene\nPRMScene\nSMILE\n Service 1\n1\n Service 2\n2\n Service 3\n Service n\nVia Widgets\nUsing\nJApplication\nFramework\nImplemented as Singleton\nFrom NetBeans\nVisual Library\niPRMScene\n…\nJava\nCM\nCASTOR\nGetter/Setter\nUn-/Marshall\nJava\niPRM\nModel Controller\nXSD\nPRM\nXSD\niPRM\nUser\n Interaction \nwith the tool\nFig. 3.

This is done through an application of the Castor\nlibrary [25]. As XML is a widespread format created models can be imported\ninto other applications and data does not need to be captured a second time.\nThe user interface is built upon the NetBeans Visual Library [26] with usage of\nthe JApplication framework. This library provides a set of reusable components,\ncalled widgets, and can be applied to create visualization. The widgets can be\naggregated and related to each other thereby reﬂecting the creation of models\nintuitively. These models are drawn o n a special canvas that in the NetBeans\nterminology is called scene. Besides the modeling capabilities the user interface\nprovides the one applying the tool with support functionalities such as ﬁltering,\ntagging, and exporting. These well-deﬁned tasks are performed by corresponding\ntailored services that are implemented following the singleton pattern to ensure\ndata consistency. The architecture described is depicted in Fig. 3, whereas how\nthe user interface (and thereby the acti ons performed by the user) is linked to\nthe architecture us show in Fig. 4.\nThe tool is separated into two units, one supporting the modeling of the PRM,\nthe other one makes the tool user able to instantiate and analyze this deﬁned\nstructure. These parts have to be used se quentially, reﬂecting the method that\nhas been described in section 2, starting with the modeling of classes and their\nattributes as well as the relationships and dependencies between them.

The second component of the Enterprise Architecture Analysis Tool (EAT)\nallows the instantiation of the PRM. Thereby one or several scenarios of interests\nare modeled according to constraints deﬁned in the dependency structure for the\nPRM. Afterwards the analysis is performed. Therefore the instantiated PRM is\ntranslated into a Bayesian network that is understandable by the Smile library\n[27]. This library performs the evaluation of the network. Finally the calculated\nvalues are written back to the instantiated PRM and visualized for the tool user.\nThe person applying the tool can then compare the modeled scenarios and\ntheir contained classes by considering the probabilities that attributes of the\nclasses are in a certain state; thereby theidentiﬁcation of the conﬁguration that\nqualiﬁes best is made possible.\n4 Example Tool Application\nThis section will illustrate how the tool can be applied in practice. The meta-\nmodel and instance model presented here are drawn from a case study performed\nat a Swedish power utility company in November 2009. In this case study the\ncyber security of an electric substation was the concern. The metamodel is thus\nintended to support cyber security analysis and the instance model represents\none of the utility’s substations. The qualitative structure of the metamodel (or\nPRM) was created based on a literature review; the quantitative part was in this\nA Tool for Enterprise Architecture Analysis 115\nUsed by\nRun\nBelong to\nInsecure\nzone Secure\nzoneClient\nServer\nFig. 5. The PRM for cyber security analysis showing classes and attributes relevant\nfor the analysis\ncase assessed (subjectively) by a security researcher. Interviews with a system\nadministrator and investigations of system documentation were used to create\nthe instance model.\n4.1 Probabilistic Relational Model over Security\nThe PRM used in this case study is depicted in Fig. 5. The PRM covers a\nnumber of concepts that are of relevanceto the cyber security computer networks\nincluding ﬁrewalls, data ﬂows, software services network zones and organizational\nfunctions. The qualitative structure of this PRM is described below together with\nsome examples of conditional probabilities deﬁned in the PRM.\nThe primary purpose of ﬁrewalls is to control access to network addresses.\nThey do so by blocking unwanted data ﬂows from adjacent zones, and by allowing\nthose that are wanted. With a protection scheme following the principle ‘deny\nby default’, a Firewall will allow a number of DataFlows to pass into the secure\nZone from other Zones. In this ConcretePRM a Firewall holds the reference\nslots Allow with range DataFlow which point to data ﬂows that are allowed. A\nFirewall also has the reference slots SecureZone and InsecureZone with range\nZone which refers to the zones that are directly separated by the ﬁrewall.\nThe Firewall has the attributePossibleToReconﬁgurewhich indicates if it pos-\nsible for a threat agent to reconﬁgure the ﬁrewall or not. This attribute inﬂuences\nthe attributeFirewall.Functioning which indicates whether the ﬁrewall functions\n116 M. Buschle et al.\nas it should. If the ﬁrewall is working it will prevent unauthorized connections\nfrom insecure zones to secure zones. The attribute Service.PossibleToConnect\nstates whether the threat agent can connect to a Service. The threat agent can\nalso connect to the service if it has access to the service’s zone or if data ﬂows are\nallowed from a zone where the threat agent have access. If the threat agent has\naccess or not is expressed through the attribute Zone.PossibleToAccess which\nhas a diﬀerent value in the subclasses PublicNetwork, CorportateNetwork and\nProcessNetwork.\nIf it is possible to connect to the service(i.e. Service.PossibleToConnect=True)\nit might be possible to exploit a vulnerability in the service. The attribute Ser-\nvice.PossibleToExploitVulnerabilityexpresses whether this is possible or not. The\nreference slot Service.Host points to theHost that executes the service. The pos-\nsibility to exploit vulnerabilities in the service inﬂuences if it possible to execute\nmalware on the service’s host. The possibility to execute malware on the host is\nalso inﬂuenced by the existence of a functioning malware scanner in the host. The\nattribute Host.FunctioningMalwareScanner indicates whether this is the case or\nnot. Another way to inﬂuence the possibility to execute malware is through users\nin the Organizational Function that use the host and that install executables,\ni.e. the attribute OrganizationalFunction.MakeUserInstallExecutable.\n4.2 Instance Model\nThe classes and reference slots in the PRM were used to model one of the utility’s\nsubstations (cf. Fig. 6 for a screenshot of the tool). Four network zones where\nfound in this study.\nThe OﬃceNetwork is the insecure side of the CorporateFirewall.T h e Cor-\nporateFirewall allows two data ﬂows: RemoteDesktop to pass through from the\nOﬃceNetwork to the service TerminalServices and the data ﬂow Substation-\nCommunication from the zone ControlCenterNetwork to ControlSystemServer.\nThe GatewayFirewall is connected to the Internet and allows data to pass from\nboth the OﬃceNetwork and the SuppliersLAN.\nWithin the substation there are two instances of the ProcessNetwork.T h e\nSubstationLAN is where the servicesControlSystemServer and TerminalServices\nbelong; the service VNCInterface belongs to the ModemLAN.T h eControlSys-\ntemServer is within the hostStationController.T h eControlSystemServer is also\nthe server side of the data ﬂow SubstationCommunication.\nThe service\nTerminalServices is associated with the hostServiceGateway and\nacts as the server side of the data ﬂow RemoteDesktop.T h eServiceGateway is\nknown to have a malware scanner that is functioning and evidence to support\nthis fact is stored within the model.

This modiﬁcation would ensure that SubstationEngineers do not\nuse the EmbeddedController. A change like this would remove the dependency\nrelationship between SubstationEngineers.MakeUserInstallExecutable and Em-\nbeddedController.PossibleToExecuteMalware. For all cases other than Substatio-\nnEngineers.MakeUserInstallExecutable=False this would reduce the probabil-\nity of EmbeddedController.PossibleToExecuteMalware being true.M a k i n gt h e\nchange in the tool with the present PRM changes P(EmbeddedController. Pos-\nsibleToExecuteMalware) from 50 % to 37 %.\n5 Discussion and Future Works\nThis paper presents a tool which supports enterprise architecture analysis with\nthe use of the PRM formalism. While providing a powerful mechanism for the\nuse of discrete variables in an analysis, the PRM formalism in its initial form\nhas a few weaknesses that deserve furthe r studies. Several system qualities are\ntypically analyzed through the usage of continuous variables e.g. in [28] con-\ntinuous variables are used for performance analysis. In order to perform those\nevaluations with support of the presented tool it is necessary to discretize all\ncontinuous variables. At the moment we are investigating how the PRM formal-\nism can be extended so that it can be used with combinations of continuous and\ndiscrete variables, so called hybrid networks [29], as well as a corresponding tool\nimplementation.\nAnother weakness of the PRM formalism is that it does not provide any\nmeans to query the models for structural information such as “given an informa-\ntion system, how many elements does the set of related data objects contain?”\nThe Object Constraint Language (OCL) [30] is a formal language developed to\ndescribe constraints on UML models. OCL provides a means to specify such\nconstraints and perform queries on the models in a formal language. OCL in its\noriginal form is side eﬀect free, but currently an imperative version of OCL is\nbeing added to the tool. Thereby the analysis functionality can be extended to\nconsider the structure of the PRM instantiation more comprehensively.\nBesides the two mentioned shortcomings of the formalism used there are some\nimprovements with respect to usability. Regarding the user interface of the tool,\nwe are planning to make the models more intuitive and the information provided\neasier to understand. Enterprise architecture models are more understandable if\nthey only depict the interesting parts of the model (in a goal-sense). Therefore,\nthe tool should be extended to support views and viewpoints, e.g. as presented in\n[28]. Additionally we plan the support of iconic visualization of typical enterprise\narchitecture elements, such as applications or data objects, to present the models\nin an easily understandable way. Finally we are planning to integrate the support\nof predeﬁned model components. As mod els based on the same metamodel are\nlikely to have common parts, the mode ling process can be sped up if common\nbuilding blocks are oﬀered by the metam odel provider and used by the person\nthat creates a certain model.\n120 M. Buschle et al.\n6C o n c l u s i o n\nIn this paper a tool and method for analysis of enterprise architecture scenarios\nwas presented. To fulﬁll this purpose the tool consists of two separate parts, one\nfor deﬁning analysis theory and another for enterprise architecture modeling, and\nmakes use of the PRM formalism for specifying theory. Applying this formalism\nallows for the consideration of uncerta inty, an aspect that so far is uncommon\nin the ﬁeld of enterprise architecture analysis. The paper describes the PRM\nformalism as well as the underlying architecture of the tool brieﬂy.\nIn the paper an example of security assessment was outlined, but the tool sup-\nports the analysis of various quality attributes such as maintainability, data qual-\nity, and interoperability. The tool supports information system decision making\nas it allows the comparison of several scenarios with regard to a system quality.\nThereby the “as-is” as well as several “t o-be” architecture of an enterprise can\nbe compared quantitatively in order to ﬁnd the one that best satisﬁes decision\nmaker requirements.\nReferences\n1.
