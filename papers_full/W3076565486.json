This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agree-\nment No 797451. Preprint under Green Open Access policy \nheating and cooling, raises multiple technical concerns  [1]. All \nactions to handle these concerns, both preventive and correc-\ntive, are either limiting the deployment of more DER or curtail-\ning the energy that these may exchange with the grid [2]. Online \nmonitoring of system behavior with high DER penetrations can \ntackle efficiently most of the known technical concerns and oth-\ners, not yet foreseen. Indicatively, system situational awareness \n(congestion, voltage stability, etc.) [3], use of innovative system \nstability controls [4] as also traditional ones [5], assessment of \nquality of supply, awareness of availability and timely activa-\ntion of flexibility services  [6], and efficient fault identification \nand localization are few of the contributions of real-time system \nmonitoring in this cont ext [7]. Secondly, online measurements \nof systems hosting DER and extracting metrics of average load-\ning of the equipment will contribute positively in assessing in-\nvestment deference in grid infrastructure [8]. Thus, all available \ngrid hosting capacity can be made of use and avoid the tradi-\ntional oversizing design of power systems. In a similar sense, \nsituations that affect equipment undesirably (e.g. inverse flows \non relays) may be captured and handled accordingly. Thirdly, \nsystem operators seek to improve power quality and better serve \nelectric equipment according to performance standards [9]. \nA.  Distribution System and Transformer Monitoring Review \nThe above points have led to extensive research and innova-\ntive applications regarding monitoring medium  (MV) & low \nvoltage (LV) DSs either at the extent of whole feeders or as \nsmall as specific components in them. The methods and tech-\nnologies typically employed at transmission infrastructure are \nshowing the way; transmission lines and substations are moni-\ntored either with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition \n(SCADA) systems [10] or, more recently, Phasor Measurement \nUnits (PMU), and operators monitor the grid at sub-second time \nscale [11]. At DSs, much research has focused on methods of \nstate estimation  [12, 13] , PMU for this level specifically \n(uPMU) [14], microgrid design and control and energy man-\nagement systems of various purposes and capacities [15]. In ac-\ntual practice, there are different levels of deployments of data \nacquisition and ma nagements systems at the distribution level \nof grids around the world. SCADA, distribution management \nsystems and Advanced Metering Infrastructure  [16] – most re-\ncently with smart meters – have been those which have been \nadopted more widely, while installations and use of uPMU have  \nPanayiotis Moutis, Senior Member, IEEE, Omid Alizadeh-Mousavi \nDigital Twin of Distribution Power Transformer \nfor Real-Time Monitoring of Medium V oltage \nfrom Low V oltage Measurements \nM \n \n \nFig. 1.  Circuit models of a power T/F at various levels of detail. \nbeen at earlier stages. Most of these works focus at the MV level \nof DSs, which raises a concern of much practical interest – the \nuse of voltage transformers for measurements  [17]. Given the \nextent of DS feeders, the costs , risks and network disruptions  \n(e.g. replacement of cable headend)  to deploy measurement \nT/F, can gravely affect the goals for monitoring DS. \nFrom the aspect of monitoring the operation and health of \nspecific system components, power transformers (T/F) are at \nthe center of attention of many studies. In [18], measurements \nfrom both sides of the T/F help determine copper and iron losses \nunder harmonics -heavy conditions. In -rush and fault currents \nare identified with wavelet methods in [19]. Harmonics analysis \nis used in [20] to capture geomagnetic disturbance on T/F. Mon-\nitoring the higher -voltage side o f the T/F in [21] assists in as-\nsessing the insulation performance under lightning impulses, \nwhile frequency response analysis [22] can be an alternative to \nlocate faults in the equipment. Maintenance and ageing con-\ncerns are also addressed more recently with greater attention  \n[23, 24]. The value of measuring T/F performance, especially \nfor power quality matters, reflects also in the focus on instru-\nment T/Fs accuracy [25]. As for using uPMUs to monitor T/F, \ntheir high costs and data requirements are prohibiting factors. \nB.  Innovation of the Power Transformer Digital Twin \nThe following proposal is put forward in this paper. The MV \nside of a distribution T/F may be monitored via its digital twin, \ninstead of directly measuring its voltage and current waveforms \nat its terminals. The digital twin  [26] of the MV side will be \ninformed by current and voltage wavef orm measurements of \nthe LV side of the distribution T/F. A digital twin is a digital \nreplica of an actual entity, expected to behave and perform same \nto the actual entity. Hence, a digital twin offers insight to events \nthat might occur to the actual entity or serve as the online model \nof it. The latter case is the one that this proposal is based on.  \nThe potential of digital twins in the power systems sector has \nonly been recently acknowledged and explored [27]. \nTo the authors’ knowledge there has been no effort like the \none presented in this manuscript. A digital twin of a power T/F \nhas been proposed only as a means to assess its health status \n[28], but not to monitor voltage, current and power in real time.  \nTo monitor a DS  MV-LV power T/F , voltage and current \nwaveforms of the LV side are measured to calculate the \nrespective waveforms of the MV side. Hence, the proposed \nwork develops the digital twin of the MV side of the power T/F, \nbased on monitoring of its LV side. Th e scope of this work \nspans DS monitoring in real time (for diagnosing faults and \npower quality issues ) as also for long -term operating and \nplanning assessments (feeder loading, hosting capacity, etc).  \nThe work contributes in the scoped field as follows: \n- Monitoring DSs at high time granularity , as anticipated by \n[12-16], is made possible, \n- The waveform monitoring allows to determine power qual-\nity in real time [9], as it captures all harmonics content, \n- MV DS behavior under  faults [7] can be captured  fully to \nalert the system operator and logged for further analysis, \n- The MV-side waveforms outputted by the digital twin of the \nT/F are as accurate as the measurements of an instrument \nT/F [17] on the MV side of the actual T/F, \n- Technical personnel and system operator can assess imme-\ndiately any remedial actions to system events [6], \n- The cost of measurement instrumentation at the LV side of \na power T/F is considerably lower than that of the MV side \nor of monitoring both sides, thus , making the method less \ncostly for system operators with multiple feeders to cover, \n- Installation of LV side measurement devices requires the \nMV network to be interrupted under fewer circumstances, \nthus, enabling a comparably seamless deployment, \n- Works on uPMU and DS state estimation at the MV and the \nhere proposed method may complement each other. \nAll the aforementioned points describe the digital twin as a \nmethod for monitoring the MV -side of a distribution T/F with \nlimited cost, no disruption to the DS f or deployment, high ac-\ncuracy, and enabling fault diagnosis (previously unprecedented \nfrom monitoring the LV-side of feeders). \nThe innovation of this work is the real -time monitoring of \nthe MV side of a distribution T/F without directly measuring \nthe MV side, but by rather measuring the LV-side of said T/F. \nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section \nII describes the methodology employed and the basic assump-\ntions both for single and three phase T/F. Section III describes \nthe testing set-up, the phenomena that are assessed and the met-\nrics used. Section IV gathers all tests conducted and a discus-\nsion ensues. Section V uses actual LV and MV measurements \nfrom a DS T/F in Switzerland, to show that the digital twin \nmethod performs effectively and according to the statistical \ntesting results of Section IV.  Section V I concludes this work \nand proposes future considerations. \nII.  METHODOLOGY AND REQUIRED ASSUMPTIONS \nA.  Digital Twin of a Single-Phase Power Transformer \nThe idea of the proposed methodology  is based on taking \nmeasurements of voltage and current on the low-voltage side of \nthe T/F and, by using the mathematical description of a typical \nmodel of single-phase T/F, calculate (as an estimate/projection) \nwhat are the values of the voltage and curre nt on the MV side \nof the T/F. In this sense, the MV side of the T/F is emulated in \nsilico; its digital twin is implemented. As well documented, T/F \ncan be modeled as 2-port systems; either a pi- or a t-equivalent \ncircuit with the resistances, reactances lu mped or split, accord-\ning to the degree of detail sought for ( see Fig. 1 ) [29]. Circuit \nmodel (a) is the full T/F model, circuit model (b) assumes that  \n\n \n \nFig. 2.  Overall topology of the digital twin method for the calculation of the \nMV side waveforms of a DS T/F based on LV waveform measurements. \nall series resistance and reactance is lumped on one side of the \nT/F as Rs=R1+R2 and Ls=L1+L2, while circuit model (c) simpli-\nfies (b) by assuming infinite impedance from Lm and Rm. Due to \nits simplicity, circuit model ( b) is the preferred digital twin of \nthe MV side of the single -phase T/F for the proposed method-\nology. Additional detail will only improve the results that fol-\nlow. As of circuit ( b) and assuming that the T/F is sized and \noperated according to standard [30] (i.e. T/F core saturation is \navoided, otherwise a piece-wise formulation [31] may comple-\nment the following set-up), the MV calculations are as: \n𝑢2(𝑡)=𝑢′\n1(𝑡)+𝑅𝑆𝑖′1(𝑡)+𝐿𝑆\n𝑑𝑖′1(𝑡)\n𝑑𝑡\n𝑖2(𝑡)=𝑢2(𝑡)\n𝑅𝑀\n+ 1\n𝐿𝑀\n∫𝑢2(𝑡) 𝑑𝑡+𝑖′1(𝑡)}\n \n \n (1) \nWhere u, i, R and L are voltage, current, resistance and induct-\nance, respectively. Resistances RS and RM may also be ex-\npressed as functions of temperature or of T/F loading (i.e. infer-\nring temperature), to allude to the effect of temperature on re-\nsistances at different loads. Voltage and current are given as \ntime variables, since waveforms are measured. Subscripts 1, 2, \nS and M denote the LV and MV sides, series and shunt (leakage \nand magnetizing impedances) parts of the single-phase T/F, re-\nspectively. Volt age and current measurements of the LV side \nare referenced to the MV side (i.e. multiplied by the T/F ratio). \nAny tap-changing action in the T/F is considered an input to the \ndigital twin model. Alternatively, tap -changing can be moni-\ntored electrically by the digital twin and, thus, adjust values in \n(1). Let it be stressed that (1) may also calculate any harmonics \ncontent either in the voltage or the current of the MV-side of the \nT/F, provided it is present in the LV -side measurements. The \nonly concern with  regards to this calculation stems from any \nfiltering effects probably caused by the T/F impedance. These \nconcerns will be thoroughly assessed in Section IV. \nFrom (1) monitoring of the voltage and current waveforms \nof the LV side can yield voltage and current waveforms of the \nMV side of the T/F. In detail, an AC voltage and current \nmeasurement device is connected to the LV side of the single-\nphase T/F and measures the respective values. The voltage and \ncurrent sensors provide  the measurements in analog form and \nthe measurement device converts the analog signals to digital at  \n \nFig. 3.  Block diagram of simulation testing topology as set up in MATLAB. \na sampling rate of fs (sampling interval 1/fs s). With the use of \nthe last two measurement samples, i.e. n and n-1, of voltage and \ncurrent at every sampling interval n, and via formulation (1) the \nvoltage and current of the MV side are retrieved. Measurements \nn and n-1 are required at every interval n, because of the effect \nof the derivative and the integral in (1). The discretized \nformulation of (1) is given, as the formal definition of the digital \ntwin of the MV side of the T/F as by LV side measurements: \n𝑢2[𝑛]=𝑢′\n1[𝑛]+𝑅𝑆𝑖′\n1[𝑛]+𝐿𝑆(𝑖′\n1[𝑛]−𝑖′\n1[𝑛−1])𝑓𝑠\n𝑖2[𝑛]=𝑢2[𝑛]\n𝑅𝑀\n+𝑢2[𝑛]−𝑢2[𝑛−1]\n𝐿𝑀 ∙𝑓𝑠\n+𝑖′\n1[𝑛] } (2) \nWith regards to harmonics content, formula set (2) is different \nto the continuous set of (1), as the LV-side measurements must \nbe properly sampled at high rates, so that no harmonic content \nis missed. T his will be explored with assessment of multiple \nsampling rates in Section IV and consequent analysis. \nB.  Digital Twin of a Three-Phase Power Transformer \nFor the digital twin of a three-phase T/F, the approach builds \non that of the single-phase as follows: the digital twins of three \nsingle-phase T/F, each taking separate single-phase voltage and \ncurrent measurements from the LV side of a three -phase T/F, \nare appropriately integrated to emulate the three -phase voltage \nand current of the MV side of the T/F. Practically, voltage and \ncurrent measurements of each phase on the LV side are used to \ncalculate the corresponding values of one of the phases on the \nMV side through (2). The overall digital twin topology is shown \nin Fig. 2.  Following, the calculated values are elaborated ac-\ncording to the vector group of the T/F; i.e. the connection of the \nthree phase windings. For the most comm only T/F vector \ngroups in DSs, the phase voltages and the line currents of the \nMV side for one of the phases are as follows: \nYy0: 𝑢𝐴 =𝑢2𝐴 and 𝑖𝐴 =𝑖2𝐴  (3) \nDy1:  𝑢𝐴𝐵 ∙√3=𝑢2𝐴 −𝑢2C and 𝑖𝐴 =𝑖2𝐴 −𝑖2C (4) \nDy11:  𝑢𝐴𝐵 ∙√3=𝑢2𝐴 −𝑢2𝐵 and 𝑖𝐴 =𝑖2A −𝑖2B (5) \nWhere subscripts A, B, C  denote the three phases of the MV \nside of the digital twin of the three-phase T/F, and subscript 2X \n(where X = A, B, C) denotes the calculated values of the single \nphase MV side digital twin  from LV measurements via (2). \nGrounding either T/F side does not alter formulations (3-5). The \ndigital twin of a T/F connected as Dy will not be able to calcu-\nlate MV-side current harmonics of orders multiples of the third, \nsince such T/F topologies eliminate said harmonics [32].  \n\n \nIII.  TESTING FRAMEWORK AND ASSESSMENT METRICS \nRetrieving the MV side waveforms from monitoring the \nones of the LV side of a triphase T/F has to be tested for various \nlevels of loads connected to the T/F, changing load (increas-\ning/decreasing), presence of harmonics in the system, non -bal-\nanced three-phase loads, non-balanced voltage supply and sys-\ntem faults. All these situations will affect the LV side wave-\nforms differently and, by that, the performance of the method-\nology, too. A last parameter that needs to be considered is that \nof the parameters of the measurement device used for the appli-\ncation (i.e. sampling rate fs). As from the above, sets of testing \nscenarios are defined in Subsection A. \nAll simulation tests are conducted in MATLAB. For most of \nthe tests, a three-phase T/F is tested, while a single-phase T/F is \nused for the study of some specific concerns. The test topology \n(see Fig. 3) comprises a voltage source, feeding a load imped-\nance via a MV-LV T/F – all components are modeled precisely \nwith ratings given in the Appendix . The described topology is \nnot unique and represents, practically, any typical DS T/F con-\nnection. This means that any of the typical IEEE or other test \nsystems could be implemented around the described test topol-\nogy of the DS T/F and the digital twin. The inclusion of any \nDER in the test topology would also not affect the set-up, as the \ndirection of flow of currents does not affect the digital twin cal-\nculations.  This T/F will be monitored through the proposed \nmethodology. This T/F is the full model as found in MATLAB \nlibraries and has not been simplified, i.e. it represents the actual \nT/F of the simulation tests with synthetic data.  The methodol-\nogy, as described in Section II, will sample the waveforms of \nvoltage and current on the LV side of the T/F. A GridEye meas-\nurement device (class-A power quality monitoring certified)  is \nassumed to sample the waveforms [33]. GridEye is assumed to \nhave a random error in the interval of its accuracy (see Appen-\ndix).  It will then  calculate the respective voltage and current \nwaveforms and active and reactive power values of the MV side \n– i.e. its digital twin behavior. The digital twin behavior will be \ncompared for accuracy to the respective waveforms of the MV \nside of the actual T/F model (oscilloscope assumed connected). \nThe metrics of accuracy used are defined in Subsection D. \nA.  Statistical Testing of Digital Twin Methodology \nThe first set of tests is that of normal operation varied ac-\ncording to the following conditions: \ni. Constant load, increasing load and decreasing load; the load \nincrease/decrease (step change) will occur at the 0.02s mark \nof a 0.04s simulation interval. \nii. Presence or absence of harmonics in the system at the max-\nimum allowed level described by standards [34]. \niii. Sampling rates  of the measurement device at fs = [5kHz, \n10kHz, 30kHz, 52kHz]. \nFor every option in (i-iii), a different scenario is described, thus, \na total of 24 scenarios is tested. The above described conditions \nand the values assessed are non-linear. Hence, statistical analy-\nsis will be employed  [35]. This means that multiple similar \ntests/simulations will be conducted for every scenario . From \nthese tests, averages, minima and maxima of the differences be-\ntween actual and calculated waveforms will be calculated. For \nevery scenario about 17000 simulations with random initial and \nfinal conditions are conducted, to ensure statistical validity of \nthe assessment metrics (see Subsection III.D) in the 99% confi-\ndence interval at ±1% e rror. The statistical analysis, according \nto [35] ensures confidence in the performance metrics collected. \nB.  Testing of Digital Twin Methodology under System Faults, \nUnbalanced Loading and Tap-Changing Operations \nThese tests will show if the accuracy of the digital twin  is \naffected by system faults, asymmetrical behavior either at the \nMV or LV side of the T/F, and tap-changing action of the T/F. \nThe variations that need to be assessed are as follows: \niv. All types of system faults (i.e. line-to-ground (LG), LL and \nLLG – occurring at 0.2s of 0.4s simulation ), asymmetrical \nvoltage magnitudes fed to the T/F, asymmetrical load con-\nnected to the LV side of the T/F and tap-changing action.  \nv. Presence/absence of a Peterson coil at the nearest substation \n(electrically); the said coil is commonly used to reduce \nground fault currents and sustain three-phase LV operation. \nvi. Grounding or not of the Y connected side of the T/F (Dy1 \nor Dy11 vector groups might be a ssessed interchangeably, \ngrounding of both sides of Yy needs to be considered). \nvii. Location of the fault at the MV or LV side of the T/F. \nThis set includes 72 scenarios. For each scenario a case of load \nabout equal to the rated of the T/F is assumed to be ser ved at \nthe time. The waveforms of the digital twin and of the actual \nMV side of the T/F will be compared on similarity of behavior \nwithout the use of metrics. The reason for not using statistical \nmetrics and as it will be noted in Section IV, is because the dig-\nital twin of the MV side is either correctly calculating the actual \nwaveforms of the T/F or completely miscalculates one or two \nphases by magnitude or phase shifting. In this sense, the statis-\ntical metrics as extracted from scenarios ( i-iii) will either be \nvalid for a correct calculation by the method in scenarios ( iv-\nvii) or the method fails substantially. All testing for the second \nset will be conducted at the presence of harmonics (see details \nin (ii) above) as this represents the worst -case scenario for the \nmonitoring methodology here proposed. \nC.  Filtering Effect of the Digital Twin on Harmonics \nThe last set of tests aims to assess the effect of the T/F model \nused (see (1) ,(2) and Fig. 1 ) to extract the digital twin of the \nMV side of the T/F, with regards to whether it captures all volt-\nage and current components. The tests will be conducted on \nMATLAB, but for a single -phase T/F, due to simplicity. Both \nthe actual T/F and its models, as ci rcuits, are, essentially, low -\npass filters, which damp the magnitude of higher-order harmon-\nics. That been said, the model of the T/F used for the digital \ntwin of its MV side might be filtering higher harmonics differ-\nently than the actual T/F, hence overestimating or underestimat-\ning the harmonic distortion at the MV level of the grid. To ad-\ndress this concern, firstly, the Fourier transformation of voltage \nand current waveforms of the digital twin and the actual MV \nside of the T/F will be compared for simulat ions of changing \nload at the presence of harmonics (see details in (b) above). Sec-\nondly, the Bode diagram of the model used for the digital twin \nand that of the circuit of the actual T/F will be compared for \nhigh and low loading of the T/F. \n \nTABLE I \nSTATISTICS OF ΔX𝑡̃ FOR NORMAL OPERATION WITHOUT HARMONICS, GIVEN \nIN % OF RMS VALUE OF CORRESPONDING VARIABLE, FOR  \nCONSTANT (0), INCREASING (+) AND DECREASING (-) LOAD IMPEDANCE \nΔL \nfs \n(kHz) \n0 + - \nAvg \nMax \nMin \nAvg \nMax \nMin \nAvg \nMax \nMin \n5 \nV 3.7 7.4 3.4 3.8 5.4 3.5 3.8 5.4 3.5 \nI 2.7 5.6 1.8 2.6 4.4 2.0 2.6 4.4 2.0 \nP 4.9 36.4 0.01 2.4 7.6 0.1 2.4 8.5 0.1 \nQ 8.6 >100 1.5 3.1 29.2 1.5 3.1 60.7 1.6 \nfV 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.004 0.05 0.0 0.004 0.05 0.0 \nfI 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.02 0.08 0.0 0.02 0.08 0.0 \n10 \nV 1.9 4.7 1.6 2.1 3.8 1.7 2.1 3.5 1.7 \nI 2.5 4.9 0.9 1.6 3.3 0.9 1.6 3.4 0.9 \nP 4.8 38.7 0.01 2.4 7.6 0.1 2.3 9.8 0.1 \nQ 7.0 >100 1.5 3.0 29.2 1.5 3.5 50.4 1.5 \nfV 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.002 0.03 0.0 0.002 0.03 0.0 \nfI 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.02 0.06 0.0 0.02 0.2 0.0 \n30 \nV 0.9 4.9 0.6 1.1 2.7 0.8 1.1 2.7 0.8 \nI 2.9 5.5 0.3 1.7 3.0 0.4 1.7 3.2 0.5 \nP 4.9 36.4 0.01 2.4 8.5 0.1 2.3 7.6 0.1 \nQ 8.5 >100 1.5 3.0 60.3 1.5 3.5 57.2 1.6 \nfV 0.003 0.005 0.0 0.003 0.02 0.0 0.003 0.02 0.0 \nfI 0.002 0.005 0.0 0.01 0.04 0.0 0.01 0.1 0.0 \n52 \nV 0.7 3.5 0.4 0.9 2.6 0.6 0.9 2.4 0.6 \nI 3.1 5.6 0.3 1.8 3.4 0.4 1.9 3.2 0.5 \nP 4.8 38.7 0.01 2.4 7.6 0.1 2.3 9.7 0.1 \nQ 7.0 >100 1.5 3.0 29.2 1.5 3.5 50.3 1.6 \nfV 0.003 0.008 0.0 0.003 0.02 0.0 0.004 0.02 0.0 \nfI 0.002 0.008 0.0 0.01 0.04 0.0 0.01 0.2 0.0 \nD.  Assessment Metrics \nFor the first set of scenarios, regarding all options in ( i-iii), \nthe waveforms of voltage and current, values of active and re-\nactive powers, and frequency of the digital twin of the MV side \nof the T/F (as calculated by the proposed methodology) will be \ncompared to those of the actual T/F. Specifically for frequency, \nthe zero crossing of ten consecutive periods of waveforms of \ncurrent and voltag e (compared separately) will be averaged \nover the time between the first and last crossing and the respec-\ntive frequency will be calculated and compared via a similar \nelaboration of the actual waveform of voltage or current of the \nMV side. For the said comp arisons, metrics of average and \npoint errors between the actual waveforms and that of the digi-\ntal twin will be used, and are defined as follows. \nFor one of the simulations in scenario k, assuming that xd,k is \nthe waveform (voltage or current) of the digital twin of the MV \nside of the T/F and xr,k the respective waveform of the actual \nT/F on its MV side, the two will be compared point-to-point for \nevery time sample interval n.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThe Section is organized in two subsections, the first one \nsummarizing the results per sets of scenarios with common \ncharacteristics and the second one discussing the findings in \nlight of the efficacy of the proposed methodology. \nA.  Results \n    1)  Statistical Testing under Normal Operation: In Tables I-\nII the statistics of metrics 𝛥𝑥𝑡̃ and 𝛥𝑥𝑡,𝑀 for voltage, current, \nactive and reactive power, and system frequency  are presented \nfor the case that no harmonics are present in the grid, while Ta-\nbles III-IV the same metrics at the presence of all harmonics \nwithin the limits of [34]. The statistics given are average (Avg), \nmaximum (max) and minimum (min) for metrics 𝛥𝑥𝑡̃ and \n𝛥𝑥𝑡,𝑀, accordingly. “0” denotes a scenario of constant load, “+” \nof increasing, and “-” of decreasing. V, I, P, Q, fV and fI are volt-\nage, current, active an d reactive power, and frequency calcu-\nlated by the voltage and current waveforms, respectively.

The reason is that frequency is averaged over multiple \nelectric cycles (See Section III.B), hence there is no point error \n(and for that matter maximum point error). \nIndicatively, some statistics are here read for the ease of the \nreader. From Table I, for the scenario of incr easing load at \nfs=10kHz of the methodology with no harmonics in the system, \nthe maximum of the average errors Δx𝑡̃ of the active power of \nthe digital twin over all simulations for this scenario is 7.6% \nwith regards to the RMS of the actual active power of the T/F. \nFrom Table IV, for the scenario of constant load at fs=30kHz of \nthe method with harmonics in the system, the average of the \nmaximum errors Δx𝑡,𝑀 of the current of the digital twin over all \nsimulations for this scenario is 6.2% with regards to th e RMS \nof the actual active power of the T/F.  For a load increase, the \nMV side waveforms of the digital twin at fs=52kHz and the ac-\ntual T/F are given in Fig. 4, to depict the performance of the \nmethod. \n    2)  System Faults, Unbalanced Loading and Tap-Changing \nOperations: The scenarios of system faults are presented first. \nIn Fig. 5 the phase voltages and line currents, at the occurrence \nof a LG fault on the MV side of a Dy11 T/F grounded on its LV \nside and a coil grounding the neutral of the voltag e source are \npresented. The sampling rate of the digital twin methodology is \nat fs=30kHz. The coil emulates the Peterson coil connected to \nthe substation upstream from distribution T/F. The digital twin \nmethodology fails to calculate only phase voltages of  the MV \nside of the T/F by phase and magnitude. The method fails also  \nonly for phase voltages (but for different magnitudes and phase  \nTABLE IV \nSTATISTICS OF ΔX𝑡,𝑀 FOR NORMAL OPERATION WITH HARMONICS, GIVEN IN \n% OF RMS VALUE OF CORRESPONDING VARIABLE, FOR  \nCONSTANT (0), INCREASING (+) AND DECREASING (-) LOAD IMPEDANCE \nΔL \nfs \n(kHz) \n0 + - \nAvg \nMax \nMin \nAvg \nMax \nMin \nAvg \nMax \nMin \n5 \nV 37.5 43.2 37.0 37.9 40.2 37.2 9.0 11.3 8.3 \nI 8.7 26.0 5.4 15.3 50.0 8.4 44.5 >100 8.0 \nP 5.0 36.7 0.1 2.6 8.9 0.2 5.1 6.2 4.8 \nQ 8.7 >100 1.5 4.2 78.5 1.9 2.8 4.8 1.2 \n10 \nV 18.2 22.3 17.7 18.8 22.2 18.0 18.8 21.5 17.0 \nI 6.5 18.0 2.4 6.0 26.2 3.1 4.9 12.2 2.4 \nP 4.8 39.0 0.1 2.5 7.9 0.1 2.7 10.6 0.2 \nQ 7.1 >100 1.5 4.0 40.8 1.9 4.0 57.6 1.8 \n30 \nV 7.3 13.3 6.8 7.7 10.2 6.8 7.6 10.7 5.8 \nI 6.2 11.2 1.0 3.9 6.4 1.1 3.9 6.6 1.0 \nP 5.0 36.7 0.1 2.6 8.9 0.1 2.6 8.3 0.1 \nQ 8.6 >100 1.5 3.9 77.5 1.8 3.9 70.9 1.8 \n52 \nV 4.4 8.7 3.9 4.9 8.8 3.8 4.7 7.6 3.0 \nI 6.3 11.0 0.8 3.0 6.8 1.0 4.0 6.5 0.9 \nP 4.8 39.0 0.1 2.5 7.9 0.1 2.6 10.4 0.2 \nQ 7.0 >100 1.5 3.9 40.6 1.8 3.9 57.6 1.8 \nshifts) if: \n- the fault is LLG or LG and  \n- the T/F is connected as Dy (regardless of grounding) or Yy \nwith only one or neither of the two sides grounded and \n- the substation is grounded at its MV side.  \nPhase voltages of the MV side of the T/F are also the only ones \nmiscalculated at the occurrence of  any type of fault on the LV \nside of the T/F. For the ease of the reader the rest of these plots \nare omitted.  \nThe phase voltages and line currents, at the occurrence of a \nLG fault on the MV side of a Dy11 T/F grounded on its LV side \nand without grounding of the neutral of the voltage source are \npresented in Fig. 6. The sampling rate of the digital twin method \nis at fs=30kHz. The absence of grounding of the voltage source \nis equivalent to the substation upstream of the distribution T/F  \n \nFig. 4.

In this case, the digital twin \nphase voltages of the MV side of the T/F and the actual ones \ncompare successfully. The methodology succeeds similarly, if: \n- the fault is LL and regardless of any topology specifics for \neither the T/F or the substation or  \n- the fault is either LG or LLG, the substation is not grounded \non its LV side and regardless of the topology specifics for \nthe distribution T/F or \n- the fault is LG or LLG and the T/F is of the Yy  topology \ngrounded on both its sides and regardless of the topology \nspecifics of the substation. \nFor the ease of the reader the rest of these plots are omitted.  \nIt is stressed again that the digital twin method calculates \ncorrectly all line-to-line voltages, line currents, active and reac-\ntive powers of the MV side of the T/F  under any type of fault, \nregardless of T/F and DS grounding topologies. \nFollowing, various cases of asymmetrical voltage magnitude \nof the source and asymmetrical load impedances were tested. In \nall cases, the digital twin methodology calculated correctly all \nvoltage and current waveforms of the T/F MV side. As for tap-\nchanging actions, the accuracy of the digital twin remains unaf-\nfected. This was expected as any tap -changing action only  af-\nfects the parameters of the digital twin model, but not its math-\nematical behavior, and, thus, its accuracy.  For the ease of the \nreader all plots of these tests are omitted.  \n    3)  Filtering Effect of T/F and Digital Twin on Harmonics: \nThe Bode diagrams of the circuits representing the digital twin \nand the actual T/F are first plotted. The respective transfer func-\ntions of circuit (b) (digital twin) and circuit (a) (actual T/F) in \nFig. 1 are, first, calculated. Load equal to 10% and 100% of the \nrated apparent power of the T/F at 0.8 lag power factor has been \ntested, to assess how the T/F circuit models (acting as filters) \nsuppress harmonic components (even beyond those mentioned \nin the standard [34]). Both loading tests had similar results and \nthe case of 100% loading is shown in Fig. 7.  \n \n \nFig. 6. MV side current and phase voltage waveforms of the digital twin (sub-\nscript e, fs=30kHz) and of the actual T/F (subscript r) at a LG fault with a non-\ngrounded voltage source supply. \nIn Fig. 8 the Fourier transform of voltage and current wave-\nforms of the MV side of the digital twin ( fs= 30kHz) and the \nactual T/F are given. A load increase from  10% to 100% load-\ning has been tested. Given how the suppression of the higher \nharmonics between the actual and the digital twin of the MV \nsides of the T/F is substantially different beyond the 20 th har-\nmonic (see Fig. 7), the detail in the Fourier transform of voltage \nis focused on the interval of 20th-25th harmonics. \n \n \nFig. 7.

Fourier transform of voltage and current waveforms of MV side for ac-\ntual and digital twin (fs=30kHz) of a T/F under a load increase. \nB.  Discussion \n    1)  Statistical Testing under Normal Operation : To assess \nthe performance of the methodology under normal operation \n(Tables I-IV) both at the presence and absence of harmonics, \nFig. 9 is here presented. The figure shows the envelope of max-\nimum and minimum of the average error metric 𝛥𝑥𝑡̃ around the \naverage of the said metric of the voltage waveform of the digital \ntwin from that of the actual T/F MV sides  for decreasing load \n(as taken from Table I) . It is clear that the average is consider-\nably closer to its minimum value than its maximum. This can \nbe noticed for all values, for both metrics ( 𝛥𝑥𝑡̃ and 𝛥𝑥𝑡,𝑀) in \nTables I-IV. This observation translates as that the average be-\nhavior of the here proposed digital twin methodology is more \nlikely to be represented by its best performance rather than cal-\nculate waveforms that deviate considerably from the ones of the \nactual T/F. This observation  is even more substantial for the \nstatistics of the maximum error metric in 𝛥𝑥𝑡,𝑀. The averages \nof metric 𝛥𝑥𝑡,𝑀 can be used to define an interval around the \naverages of error metric 𝛥𝑥𝑡̃ instead of the standard deviation \nof the latter, representing, thus, a more realistic error interval \nfor the waveform calculations of the digital twin methodology. \nFig. 10 shows exactly that, as the expected error interval for all \nwaveforms of the digital twin of the MV side of the T/F for the \ncase of constant load. For either increasing or decreasing load \nthe respective graphs are similar (see Tables I-IV for the statis-\ntics) and have been omitted. \n In terms of absolute values, let it be first reminded that in-\nstrument voltage transformers are classified according to their \naccuracy errors which span the interval 0.1-3% over the voltage \nRMS value [17]. It may be seen that at the absence of harmonics \nand for fs ≥ 30kHz even the average maximum errors fall in this \ninterval for the proposed digital twin methodology. At the pres-\nence of harmonics , the digital twin methodology can have ac-\ncuracy performance comparable to that of the voltage T/F only  \n \nFig. 9. Statistics of average error metric as of Δx𝑡̃ for voltage of the MV digital \ntwin of the T/F at the absence of harmonics. \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFig. 10. Expected error interval of waveform calculations by the digital twin of \nthe MV side of T/F compared to the actual ones at the absence (a) and presence \n(b) of harmonics and with constant load connected to the T/F. \nby the average metric at fs ≥ 10kHz. Fig. 10 confirms this ob-\nservation as error tends to decrease as fs increases. With limited \ncalculation errors of all MV waveforms as fs increases, the com-\nplexity introduced by expressing T/F resistances as functions of \ntemperature (see Section II.A) can be avoided. \nSome particularly high maximum errors for both metrics for \nthe active and reactive power s may be noted in Tables I -IV. \nThose errors are noted to occur only at loading of the T/F less \nthan 5% of its nominal, thus, are not of concerning nature. Also, \nit is reminded that Δx𝑡̃ and Δx𝑡,𝑀 are normalized over the RMS \nof the respective waveform. Hence, if the normalization of Δx𝑡̃ \nand Δx𝑡,𝑀 was over the nameplate power instead of the RMS of \nthe waveform, they would be negligibly small, i.e. less than 4%. \nAs for the frequency calculated by the digital twin, the aver-\nages of the average error metric Δx𝑡̃ is about the same regard-\nless on whether the frequency is calculated by the voltage or the \ncurrent waveform (Tables I and III), with a slight favorite of the \nvoltage. Nevertheless, from the maximum errors of the metric  \n\n \nTABLE V \nMETRICS OF  ΔX𝑡̃ AND ΔX𝑡,𝑀 BETWEEN THE DIGITAL TWIN (AT 13.2 KHZ \nSAMPLING RATE) AND THE ACTUAL WAVEFORMS OF THE MV-SIDE OF A \nDISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER IN SWITZERLAND, GIVEN IN % OF RMS VALUE \nOF CORRESPONDING VARIABLE \n Dataset 1 Dataset 2 Dataset 3 Dataset 4 \nΔx𝑡̃ Δx𝑡,𝑀 Δx𝑡̃ Δx𝑡,𝑀 Δx𝑡̃ Δx𝑡,𝑀 Δx𝑡̃ Δx𝑡,𝑀 \nVR 3.8 7.1 2.9 5.4 2.9 5.0 2.9 6.1 \nVS 4.7 8.7 3.6 7.0 3.7 6.1 3.9 8.2 \nVT 3.9 7.3 2.9 5.5 3.0 5.5 3.1 6.4 \nIR 12.7 38.5 14.6 27.9 12.5 25.4 15.7 55.4 \nIS 15.8 38.0 16.3 29.8 13.7 26.2 18.9 51.7 \nIT 19.7 61.6 19.2 34.7 16.8 32.2 26.6 80.8 \nP 20.2 24.6 20.3 21.9 18.2 19.9 24.7 28.0 \nQ 5.8 21.3 6.6 13.3 4.3 11.4 5.5 12.3 \nit is made clear that the voltage waveform should be preferred \nto estimate system frequency with better accuracy. \nHarmonics affect the accuracy of the voltage waveform out-\nputted by the digital twin much more than any other value (cur-\nrent, powers, frequency). Comparing Tables I and III, for the \nsame type of load change and fs, one can notice that statistics \nfor all values but for voltage are similar. Especially for voltage, \nthe metrics of the average errors are greater in Table III that \ntested for voltage supply with harmonics. This remark can be \nexplained by the analysis of transfer function responses with the \nBode diagrams in Fig. 7, as also the circuit itself. The shunt el-\nements of the T/F pose practically infinite impedance to the cur-\nrents through it. Hence, the voltage drops caused by the series \nelements (impedances with S, 1, 2 subscripts in Fig. 1) are those \nthat affect the accuracy of the methodology , while there is no \ncurrent divider to affect the accuracy from the perspective of \ncurrents. In Fig. 7 it may be noted that higher frequency com-\nponents of voltage are damped more substantially by the digital \ntwin model  compared to the actual of the T/F. This, in turn, \nmeans that the digital twin methodology model will amplify any \nmeasurement errors (due to sampling in the context of this \nstudy) more than what would happen if the actual T/F model \nwas used as the digital twin. However, as from the Fourier \ntransform analysis in Fig. 8, it is clear that the energy contents \nof voltage of the actual and digital twin models of the MV side \nof the T/F for the frequencies that are most affected (as shown \nby the Bode diagrams in Fig. 7) are almost identical for a fs of \n30kHz. This also confirms findings noted in the previous para-\ngraph. In other words, preferring the actual T/F model  (circuit \n(a) in Fig. 1) instead of the one used (circuit (b) in Fig. 1) will \nnot improve substantially the accuracy of the digital twin, if the \nfs is adequately high. To conclude these observations, the accu-\nracy of the digital twin output is unaffected by the presence of \nharmonics (i.e. calculates MV waveforms properly), provided \nthat the sampling rate of the input waveforms is high enough. \n    2)  System Faults, Unbalanced Loading and Tap -Changing \nOperations: With regards to the performance of the digital twin \nmethod for the case of system faults, the following are noted. \nThe method relies on measurem ents of the LV side of the T/F, \nhence, unless the LV side is implicated in a phenomenon, the \nmethod will fail to calculate phase voltages. In this sense, it is \nhere reminded that no currents flow or voltages are induced to \nthe  LV  side  of  the  zero  sequence  circuit component  of  Dy  \n \nFig. 11. Topology of the collection of field data from the actual T/F in Switzer-\nland to assess the validity of the digital twin methodology. \n(regardless of grounding), YGy and Yyg  T/F at the occurrence \nof faults on the MV side of such T/F [29]. Hence, if LG or LLG \nfaults occur and the MV side of the DS is grounded (with \nPeterson coil or other), the zero sequence circuit at the MV side \nof the said T/F is subject to voltage and current that are not \npropagated to the LV side, hence the method cannot calculate \nphase voltages correctly. \nThe digital twin performs similarly for faults on the LV side \nof the T/F , too, because the voltage measurements of the \nmethod taken on the LV side of the T/F see towards the fault. \nI.e. due to the, typically, much smaller fault impedance, those \nmeasurements see close to zero voltage on the affected phases, \nhence, via (2) fail on MV side calculations. Nevertheless, this \nconcern is not critical, since the priority of system operators in \nsuch occasions would be the LV fault (captured by the method). \nV.  FIELD TEST VALIDATION OF DIGITAL TWIN OF \nDISTRIBUTION POWER TRANSFORMER METHODOLOGY \nTo assess the validity of the proposed method, current and \nvoltage waveform measurements from an actual DS MV -LV \nT/F in Switzerland, are used (for T/F characteristics, see Ap-\npendix). The  waveform measurements  were logged with  \nGridEye devices [33] on both its LV and MV sides in sync (see \nFig. 11). GridEye, although not designed to operate as a PMU, \nit largely abides by the measurement requirements (see Appen-\ndix) of the respective standard [36]. \nLV waveform measurements of the actual T/F are inputted \nto the digital twin method, and the output of calculated MV \nwaveforms of the digital twin is compared to the respective MV \nwaveform measurements of the said T/F. Four sets of waveform \ndata, of about 10 minutes each, sampled at 13.2kHz are used. \nTo assess the performance of the method Table V  presents the \nmetrics defined by Δx𝑡̃ and Δx𝑡,𝑀as the average and maximum \nerrors of the waveform outputted by the digital twin method \nnormalized over the RMS of the actual waveform of the T/F. \nAs the sampling rate of the input LV waveforms is 13.2kHz \nand there is ample harmonic content  as the data sets show (see \nFig. 12), the results in Table V will be compared to those of \nTables III and IV for sampling rates of 10kHz and 30kHz.  \n\n \n \n \n \nFig. 12. MV side current and phase voltage waveforms, and active and reactive \npower of the digital twin (subscript e, fs=13.2 kHz) and of the MV measurement \ndata of the actual T/F in Switzerland (subscript r). \nAs it may be noted all voltage, active and rea ctive power met-\nrics are within the intervals  of the statistical testing with the \nsynthetic/simulation data. The only exception is  with the met-\nrics of the currents, which are greater than the maxima of both \nΔx𝑡̃ and Δx𝑡,𝑀. Since the metrics of voltages an d powers are \nwithin the intervals of the statistical results collected from the \nsimulations with synthetic data and the current is a function of \nthem, the noted error metrics of current are a result of how these \nmetrics are normalized over the RMS of the respective wave-\nform. In fact, the T/F loading across all four datasets was par-\nticularly low (less than 5% of the namepla te 630kVA); i.e. if \nthe normalization of the error metrics was over the nominal cur-\nrent instead the RMS of the waveform, the errors would be neg-\nligibly small, i.e. no more than 4% . Similar observations were \nmade for the high error metrics of the active and reactive power \nof the digital twin for the statistical testing with synthetic data \n(see Section IV.B). \nThe generally positive behavior of the digital twin method , \nas shown by the above error metrics analysis, is corroborated \nby the comparison of the waveforms of the MV-side of the T/F \nbetween the output of the digital twin and the datasets  of the \nactual T/F in Fig. 12. The field data clearly shows that the dig-\nital twin methodology can accurately calculate the MV-side be-\nhavior of a T/F based on LV-side waveform input. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nThis work proposes a method to monitor the MV-side wave-\nforms of DS T/F, to enhance the visibility of operators into DS. \nThe method is the  digital twin of the MV side of a DS T/F . It \nhas high calculation accuracy and captures most  system faults \nand harmonics content. The accuracy of the digital twin  in-\ncreases as the sampling rate of the input LV waveforms in-\ncreases, and is comparable to that of an instrument T/F. \nNext step in the assessment of the proposed technique is to \ndeploy the method on a DS monitoring device [33] to a MV-LV \nT/F and assess its field performance. Thus, the technique will \nalso be realistically assessed in terms of installation costs and \ndisruption. Practically, the digital twin method is expected to \noffer much visibility of the MV DS to DS operators. Moreover, \nthe health of the T/F can be monitored through its performance.  \nA first research extension  that can be explored on the T/F \ndigital twin method, is its improvement in cases of compensated \nMV DS ground faults, if not both the T/F primary and second-\nary windings are ground ed. The proposed digital twin T/F set-\nup can calculate accurately MV current flows and line -to-line \nvoltages under all MV system fault conditions , but fails to cal-\nculate the phase voltages (indicator of nature of fault) in the \naforementioned specific cases. Another extension can be the ap-\nplication of the method to  MV to high voltage  T/F to monitor \nthe transmission system with reduce costs and grid disruptions. \nVII.  APPENDIX \nA.
