Genetic linkage maps based on recombination rates between physical\nmarkers have been used in biology for over 100 years and a linkage map, when\npaired with a de novo sequencing project, can resolve mis-assemblies and anchor\nchromosome-scale sequences. Here, I summarize the methodology behind integrating\nde novo assemblies and genetic linkage maps, outline the current challenges, review the\navailable software tools, and discuss new mapping technologies.\nKeywords: next-generation sequencing, draft genome, scaffolds, physical mapping, optical mapping\nIntroduction\nDe novogenome sequences are fueling a scientiﬁc revolution. Biologists are in a position to answer\nquestions that were unimaginable 30 years ago, and new technologies and resources are generating\nnew questions. However, many of these draft genomes contain thousands of individual sequences\nwith no information on how these pieces are assembled into chromosomes. This is problematic\nboth for molecular and developmental studies as individual genes may end up fractured and\nincorrectly annotated ( Baker, 2012; Denton et al., 2014) and for evolutionary studies as fragmented\ns\nequences lack the genomic context that is necessary to analyze comparative patterns. For example,\nthe analysis of 12 genomes from closely related Drosophila species found increased codon bias and\nrates of adaptive substitution in genes residing on the X chromosome (Drosophila 1 2 Genomes\nConsortium, 2007). Relying solely on DNA sequencing means there is no way to ident ify mistakes\nin the assembled genome sequence and without a high-quality way to evaluate, correct and anchor\nnext-generation assemblies, they are of limited use.\nDe novo sequencing projects can be successfully paired with a linkage map to address these\nshortcomings ( Semagn et al., 2006; Lewin et al., 2009). Millions of genetic markers can be readily\npr\noduced with high-throughput sequencing (Baird et al., 2008; Elshire et al., 2011; Heﬀelﬁnger\ne\nt al., 2014), although these large-scale datasets present signiﬁcant st atistical and computational\nchallenges. Genetic linkage maps have been used to reﬁne de novoassemblies in organisms ranging\nfrom the commercial potato (Xu et al., 2011) to the collared ﬂycatcher bird (Kawakami et al., 2014).\nT\nhere are currently few resources on integrating de novoassemblies with linkage maps, particularly\nfor researchers without extensive statistical or computational backgrounds. This article is meant to\nbe a primer for a wide range of biologists interested in using these methods. Below, I outline the\nscientiﬁc problems involved in generating de novoassemblies and linkage maps, explain how the\nFierst Pairing linkage maps with assemblies\ntwo can be integrated, summarize existing computational too ls,\nand describe new technologies for generating physical maps.\nNext Generation Genome Assembly\nDe novo genome assembly works by extracting and sequencing\nsmall segments of DNA molecules, and piecing these segments\nback together into contigs, contiguous sequences in which\nevery nucleotide is known (i.e., A, C, G, or T), and scaﬀolds ,\nsequences that contain regions with unknown nucleotides (i .e.,\nN). Next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis has shrunk t he\nprice of a million bases of sequenced DNA from $2400 (with\nSanger chain-termination sequencing;\nSanger and Coulson, 1975;\nSanger et al., 1977 ) to <$0 .25 ( Liu et al., 2012 ). The reduced\ncost makes it feasible for individual investigators to unde rtake\ngenome sequencing projects, but it carries decreases in read\nlength and accuracy. Sanger sequencing produces 400–900 bp\nsequencing reads with a per-base accuracy of 99.9% compared\nto 50–300 bp sequencing-by-synthesis reads (although long reads\nare possible) (\nPetterson et al., 2009; Quail et al., 2012 ). Next-\ngeneration sequencing has an average per-base accuracy of 99 %\nbut this decreases systematically with high and low GC bias\n(\nDohm et al., 2008 ) and results in reduced sequencing of these\nregions (Kozarewa et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013 ).\nInserting 30–350 kbp lengths of DNA into plasmids to create\nbacterial artiﬁcial chromosomes (BACs) ( O’Connor et al., 1989;\nShizuy et al., 1992 ), cosmids ( Collins and Hohn, 1978 ), and\nfosmids ( Kim et al., 1992 ) reduces the complexity of whole-\ngenome assembly by eﬀectively breaking the problem down\ninto smaller segments. These genome segments are sequenced\nand assembled individually but the process is time-consumin g\nand expensive. Sanger sequencing of plasmid clones at 10 ×\ndepth (where each nucleotide is sequenced, on average, 10\ntimes) can adequately represent the 3 Gb, >50% repetitive\nhuman genome (\nGreen, 1997; Weber and Myers, 1997 ). With\nfewer reads and longer lengths overlap/layout/consensus (O LC)\nassembly, in which all sequencing reads are compared pair-\nwise and assembled based on overlap, is feasible (\nMyers et al.,\n2000; Batzoglou et al., 2002 ). Short read lengths require >100 ×\ndepth and assembling these large, complex datasets requires\nsophisticated algorithms like de Bruijn graphs (\nPevzner et al.,\n2001), in which sequencing reads are broken down into short\nsegments of length k and these k-mers connected in large graphs\n(Pevzner et al., 2001; Zerbino and Birney, 2010 ).\nEven with sophisticated assembly algorithms, short\nsequencing reads alone can not generate the information\nthat is needed to discriminate genomic repeats and duplicatio ns\n(\nPop and Salzberg, 2008; Alkan et al., 2011 ) or ancestral\npolyploidy ( The International Wheat Genome Sequencing\nConsortium, 2014; Chapman et al., 2015 ). Many current genome\nsequencing projects rely on mate-pair libraries for long-ran ge\nsampling throughout the genome (for a review of sequencing\nstrategies, see\nEkblom and Wolf, 2014 ). These specialized\nlibraries select 1–15 kb segments of DNA for circular ligati on and\nextract the ligated ends for traditional short-read sequen cing.\nAssembly algorithms build contiguous sequences from short\nsequencing reads and use the long-range information provide d\nby mate-pairs to construct large scaﬀolds (\nGnerre et al., 2011 ).\nThe resulting sequences have high per-base accuracy in gene- rich\nregions of the genome but do not approximate ﬁnished genome\nsequences (\nAlkan et al., 2011 ).\nWhole genome shotgun (WGS) assemblies have always\nsuﬀered from the same limitations, and short read lengths hav e\nampliﬁed these problems ( Earl et al., 2011; Bradnam et al., 2013 ;\nFigure 1A). First, WGS assemblies are inherently fragmented.\nEukaryotic genomes contain, at a minimum, millions of\nnucleotides and “long” contiguous sequences do not approach\nchromosome-scale. Next-generation assemblies contain ma ny\nsmall fragments (on the order of 1000’s of nucleotides), and\nthese provide little genetic information. Second, repeat ele ments\nare diﬃcult to assemble and can result in mis-joins. Third,\ndiploid individuals, even after extensive inbreeding, will of ten\nhave residual heterozygosity (\nPrice et al., 2012 ). These sequences\nassemble poorly and sometimes occur as duplicated fragments in\nthe assembled sequence. The program REAPR (\nHunt et al., 2013 )\nevaluates assembly quality by re-aligning the DNA sequences to\nthe assembled genome but beyond this assessing quality must\nbe done through contig/scaﬀold length statistics and heurist ics\ncombining protein-coding gene annotations with comparative\nexpectations from related species with high-quality assembl ed\nsequences (\nEkblom and Wolf, 2014 ). Without a secondary source\nof information, there is no rigorous way to identify errors.\nLonger sequencing reads can build larger contiguous\nsequences and facilitate higher quality de novo assemblies\n(Alkan et al., 2011 ) but each of the new platforms has critical\nshortcomings. Illumina TruSeq synthetic long reads range u p\nto 18,500 bp ( McCoy et al., 2014 ) but rely on parallel library\npreparation coupled with traditional short read sequencing\nand bias against assembly of repeats and duplications (\nKoren\nand Phillippy, 2015 ). The Oxford Nanopore MinION passes a\nsingle strand of DNA through a protein nanopore ( Schneider\nand Dekker, 2012 ) and produces reads >20,000 bp but the\nper-base accuracy is just 70–80% ( Quick et al., 2014 ). Paciﬁc\nBiosciences single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing ( Eid\net al., 2008 ) produces reads with a median length of 3122 bp\nbut the per-base accuracy is 87% ( Koren et al., 2013 ). Paciﬁc\nBiosciences long reads can reduce assembly fragmentation w hen\npaired with short DNA sequencing reads and this strategy was\nused to assemble a 128 contig genome sequence for Drosophila\nmelanogaster (\nLandolin et al., 2014 ). Coupling long-read\nsequencing with short-read sequencing and assembly will\nrequire the development of sophisticated error-correction a nd\nassembly algorithms (\nKoren and Phillippy, 2015 ).\nMoving beyond fragmented genome assemblies requires\na linkage map ( Lewin et al., 2009; Mascher and Stein, 2014 ).\nA high-density linkage map can anchor de novo sequences\nand orient and order small fragments into chromosome-\nscale sequences ( Figure 1B). Inconsistency between markers\nin the map and markers in the assembled sequences can\nindicate incorrectly assembled sequences and residual\nheterozygosity. These can then be resolved to produce a\nhigh-quality reference draft genome. For example, the Potato\nGenome Sequencing Consortium assembled a 727 Mb genome\nsequence through deep short-read sequencing on Sanger,\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 220\nFierst Pairing linkage maps with assemblies\nFIGURE 1 | (A)In whole genome assembly errors result from residual alleles\nwhich appear as discrete sequences in the reference, and mis -joins. Small\nfragments have no genomic context and contribute little inf ormation. (B)\nUsing a genetic linkage map to anchor a de novo assembly resolves error in\nthe reference sequence by giving small sequences genomic co ntext,\nresolving allelism, and identifying mis-joins. Chromosom e-scale assemblies\ncan be constructed by ordering and orienting sequences with the linkage\nmap. (C) A genetic linkage map can be estimated from a parental cross\nresulting in an F2, F3, or Backcross (here, BC1) population. Estimating a\ngenetic linkage map requires (D) genotyping individuals at discrete markers\n(here, six markers across eight individuals with missing da ta); and (E)\ngrouping markers into linkage groups; and ordering and spac ing markers\nwithin linkage groups. Estimating order and spacing is difﬁc ult due to missing\ndata and little recombination between adjacent markers.\nIllumina, and Roche 454 platforms ( Xu et al., 2011 ). This deep\nsequencing resulted in an assembled sequence 90% of the\nestimated genome size and spread across 443 superscaﬀolds, an\nimpressive but complex and fragmented assembly. Constructio n\nof a genetic linkage map yielded 12 linkage groups and\n86% of the assembled genome was anchored to these 12\nchromosomes.\nGenetic Linkage Maps\nThe basic mathematical problem of genetic mapping is: given\na set of associations between markers, what is the most\nlikely physical arrangement of these markers on chromosomes ?\nIn the early days of mapping these were visible markers\nlike eye color in Drosophila (\nSturtevant, 1913a,b ), at the\nend of the 20th century these became DNA markers like\nRestriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs) (\nLander\nand Botstein, 1989 ), and more recently these have become Single\nNucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers generated through\nhigh-throughput DNA sequencing (for example,\nBaird et al.,\n2008; Elshire et al., 2011; Heﬀelﬁnger et al., 2014 ). Constructing\na linkage map proceeds in two steps. First, a mapping population\nmust be established to generate recombination and genetic\ndiﬀerences between related individuals ( Figure 1C). Second,\nmap estimation proceeds by genotyping individuals at diﬀerent\nmarkers ( Figure 1D), grouping markers into linkage groups\n(putative chromosomes), ordering the markers within a group in\nlinear sequence, and spacing the markers according to estima ted\ndistances along the chromosome ( Figure 1E). Missing data and\nincorrect marker typing have a large eﬀect on map estimation\nand infrequent recombination between adjacent markers mak es\nit diﬃcult to order and space markers. These limitations mean\nthat linkage maps are accurate at a large scale but lack ﬁne-sc ale\nresolution.\nCurrent Challenges in Using Linkage Maps\nwith De NovoAssemblies\nEstablishing a Mapping Population\nIncreasing the number of recombination events increases th e\nresolution of the genetic map. This can be achieved by genotypi ng\na very large mapping population but this may be diﬃcult or\nprohibitively expensive for many organisms. For example,\nvan\nOers et al. (2014) constructed a genetic map for the great tit\nParus major by SNP genotyping over 2000 individuals created\nfrom an F_2 cross. For organisms like maize that can be easily\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 220\nFierst Pairing linkage maps with assemblies\nbred Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) can be established from\nparental crosses and used for genetic mapping (\nBurr et al.,\n1988; Burr and Burr, 1991 ). However, the necessary time and\ninvestment can be prohibitive for long-lived organisms or th ose\nthat are diﬃcult to breed or grow in the lab. Genetic linkage\nmaps may be estimated from F1 populations (for example,\nEucalyptus grandis\nBartholome et al., 2015 ) but this requires\ndiﬀerent algorithms and is not supported by all map estimation\nsoftware.\nNext-generation Sequencing Markers\nThe methodology for estimating linkage maps was originally\ndeveloped for small-scale data, on the order of hundreds of\nmarkers, instead of the millions of genetic markers that are\nreadily produced with high-throughput sequencing (\nCheema and\nDicks, 2009 ). The number of possible diﬀerent orders of genetic\nmarkers scales exponentially with the number of markers, and is a\nmajor limiting factor in constructing a linkage map. For exam ple,\n5 genetic markers in the same linkage group can be ordered in 6 0\ndiﬀerent ways ( 1\n2 m !, where m is the number of markers) while 10\ngenetic markers can be ordered in 1.8 million diﬀerent ways. T he\nnecessary marker density depends on assembly contiguity, an d\nfragmented genome sequences require dense maps for anchorin g\nand orientation. Grouping, ordering and spacing dense marker\nsets is a central computational challenge and eﬃcient algori thms\nare still under development (\nWu et al., 2008; Strnadova et al.,\n2014).\nIncorrect genotypes and missing data can have a large eﬀect\non genetic map estimation, and these problems are magniﬁed\nby noisy high-throughput SNP genetic markers. Two or more\nSNPs may be artiﬁcially collapsed to a single marker because\nof sequence similarity in repeats, low-complexity regions, a nd\nparalogous genes. Biased sequencing errors may cause one loc us\nto be split into two and uneven sequencing coverage may\nresult from GC bias in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\nsequencing. Sequencing coverage can be uneven across both\ngenomic regions and alleles at one locus due to local GC conte nt.\nThis can result in diﬀerent data missing from each individual\nand a negative relationship between sample sizes for markers and\nindividuals.\nNo Existing Software Tools to Automate the\nProcess\nMap-assembly integration can proceed in two diﬀerent ways.\nFor sequence-based mapping genetic markers are aligned to\nthe draft assembly and these markers are used to construct a\nmap, while for array-based mapping the map is constructed\nﬁrst and genetic markers aligned second. For both procedures\nmultiply-mapped markers and loci must be excluded from\nthe ﬁnal map. However, there is no software to perform\neither of these processes and it requires custom scripting. Mis -\nassembled scaﬀolds can be identiﬁed through marker segregat ion\npatterns, but in practice identifying and correcting these er rors\nmust be done manually. For a typical de novo assembly\ncontaining thousands of scaﬀolds and thousands of genetic\nmarkers, this quickly becomes time-consuming and subject t o\nerror.\nTools for Estimating Genetic Linkage Maps\nIn Table 1 I summarize software packages for estimating genetic\nlinkage maps that have been used to generate a published map\nand updated since 2008. Currently there is no single software\npackage that integrates completely with de novo assembly, and\neﬃcient methods and algorithms are spread across diﬀerent\npackages. My goal is to describe the beneﬁts and limitations of\neach package so biologists can choose which to implement in\ntheir own work. For a review of older software, see\nCheema and\nDicks (2009).\nThere are several diﬀerent algorithms for estimating geneti c\nmaps (for detailed descriptions of mapping algorithms and\nperformance comparisons see\nMollinari et al., 2009; Wu et al.,\n2011) but these can be generally divided into those that couple\niterative marker ordering with probability-based sampling a nd\nthose that implement graph-based algorithms based on the\ntraveling salesman problem (TSP) (\nWu et al., 2008 ). Under the\nlatter diﬀerent loci are nodes in a graph and the TSP attempts\nto connect loci by visiting each node once and only once. The\nnodes are connected by edges, and the shortest path through th e\ngraph is the minimum spanning tree (MST) which approximates\nthe linkage structure underlying the loci. Graph-based algo rithms\nare capable of ordering >10,000 loci (\nWu et al., 2008; Rastas et al.,\n2013). In comparison, marker ordering and sampling algorithms\nare typically capable of ordering <3000 markers ( Margarido et al.,\n2007; Wu et al., 2008; Cheema and Dicks, 2009; van Ooijen,\n2011\n).\nDeveloping Integrated Approaches\nIndependent genome assembly and map construction can\nbe prohibitively expensive or fail to provide a high-quality\nassembled sequence for organisms with large, complex, repeat -\nheavy, polyploid or highly heterozygous genomes. Three\npublished methods (\nMascher et al., 2013; Hahn et al., 2014; Nossa\net al., 2014 ) integrate whole genome sequencing with linkage\nmap construction in genome assembly, variant calling, map\nestimation, and map-assisted assembly to produce assembled\ngenome sequences. PopSeq (\nMascher et al., 2013 ) was used to\norder 927 Mb of the complex, 5.1 Gb barley genome sequence\nwhich is composed of >80% repeats. Recombinant Population\nGenome Construction (RPGC) was used in a simulated\nassembly of the 100 Mb genome of the self-fertile hermaphrodit e\nCaenorhabditis elegans and produced an assembled genome\nspread across just 88 scaﬀolds (\nHahn et al., 2014 ). For a\nreview of these methods, see Mascher and Stein (2014) .\nNossa et al. (2014) combined de novo assembly with linkage\nmapping to study the organization of the 2.7 Gb genome of\nthe Atlantic horseshoe crab and uncover an ancestral genome\nduplication.\nGenetic linkage maps and de novo assemblies have two,\ncomplementary scales. Linkage maps are accurate at a large,\nchromosomal scale, but ﬁne scale marker ordering and spacing\nare inexact due to infrequent recombination between adjace nt\nmarkers. In contrast, de novo assemblies are accurate at a\nﬁne scale (100–1000’s of nucleotides) but can not be used\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 220\nFierst Pairing linkage maps with assemblies\nTABLE 1 | Software packages for estimating genetic linkage maps.\nPackage name Strengths Limitations\nR/qtl\n(\nBroman et al., 2003 )\nWritten in R (user-friendly); High functionality; Integrat ed graphics;\nTransparent, open-source implementation; Supported and u nder\ncurrent development\nDifﬁculty handling >1000 markers; No methods to address\nbias in high-throughput DNA sequence markers\nJoinMap\n(\nStam, 1993; Jansen et al.,\n2001; van Ooijen, 2011 )\nUser-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI); Efﬁcient algor ithms for\ngrouping and ordering <3000 markers\nOnly available commercially; Not open-source; Difﬁculty\nhandling >3000 markers; No methods to address bias in\nhigh-throughput DNA sequence markers\nOneMap\n(\nMargarido et al., 2007 )\nF1 crosses; Written in R; Integrates with R/qtl’s functionali ty and\ngraphics; Transparent, open-source implementation; Robu st to\ngenotyping errors and missing data\nDifﬁculty handling >1000 markers; No methods to address\nbias in high-throughput DNA sequence markers\nMSTMap\n(\nWu et al., 2008 )\nEfﬁcient algorithms for linkage grouping and marker orderin g; Can\nhandle >10,000 markers\nCan not handle F1 crosses; Little documentation; Currently\nunsupported and may not be under further development;\nNo methods to address bias in high-throughput DNA\nsequence markers\nLep-MAP\n(\nRastas et al., 2013 )\nF1 crosses; Can handle >10,000 markers; Specialized module utilizes\nscaffold location of genetic markers in assigning linkage g roups\nAssumes no recombination in one parent (specialized\nLepidopteran mating system;\nSuomalainen et al., 1973 )\nHighMap\n(\nLiu et al., 2014 )\nCan handle >1000 markers; Utilizes high-throughput sequen cing errors\nin correcting genotyping errors and imputing missing data; Graphics\nand evaluation functions\nRecently published and has not been widely tested\nto accurately reconstruct chromosome-scale relationships . An\nintegrated approach to de novo genome assembly and genetic\nlinkage mapping could utilize the information in each to build\na high-quality reference sequence. These methods are just n ow\nbeginning to appear in computational tools (\nLiu et al., 2014 ). For\nexample, LepMap ( Rastas et al., 2013 ) reduces the complexity of\nlinkage group formation with a specialized module that utiliz es\nthe scaﬀold location of genetic markers.\nPhysical Genome Maps\nThere are several molecular techniques that can generate phy sical\ngenome maps. Until recently these were prohibitively expensive\nor diﬃcult to implement but breakthroughs in technology are\nlowering prices and putting physical maps within reach.\nOptical mapping generates ordered, high-resolution maps\nof restriction sites across single DNA molecules (\nSchwartz\net al., 1993 ) and can produce high-quality, chromosome-scale\nphysical maps. Optical mapping works by immobilizing single\nmolecules of DNA on a slide, digesting the molecules with\nrestriction enzymes, visualizing the fragments with ﬂuore scence\nmicroscopy, and sizing the fragments. The fragments are then\npieced together to produce a physical map of the genome\nwith restriction site markers. Optical mapping technology was\ndeveloped over 20 years ago but its high cost has been prohibiti ve\nfor most genome projects. Currently, optical maps must still\nbe paired with a high-quality de novo assembly but developing\nnanotechnologies and single molecule sequencing are pushin g\noptical maps to the forefront of genome technology (\nLevy-Sakin\nand Ebenstein, 2013 ). For example, BioNano Genomics Irys\nSystem has reduced the price of optical mapping by an order\nof magnitude and is a feasible platform for studying structur al\nvariation in a human genome (\nCao et al., 2014 ).\nHi-C is a molecular technique that cross-links chromatin\nsegments in close physical proximity and quantiﬁes these\ninteractions with high-throughput sequencing (\nLieberman-\nAiden et al., 2009 ). The frequencies with which two regions\nof chromatin interact generates a distribution indicative o f the\ngenomic distance between the loci and suﬃcient for ordering and\norienting an assembled genome sequence ( Kaplan and Dekker,\n2013). The program LACHESIS ( Burton et al., 2013 ) both\nconstructs the frequency-based physical map and aligns scaﬀol ds\nto the map. Hi-C requires a diﬃcult molecular protocol ( de Wit\nand de Laat, 2012 ) and has not been widely adopted for genome\nassembly although it is currently under commercial developm ent\nand was used to construct genome sequences for a human and the\nAmerican alligator (\nPutnam et al., 2015 ) and Arabidopsis thaliana\n(Xie et al., 2015 ).\nContiguity preserving transposase sequencing (CPT-seq)\n(Adey et al., 2014 ) capitalizes on the unique properties of\ntagmentation, a recently developed method for both fragmenti ng\nDNA and appending sequencing adaptors ( Adey et al., 2010 ).\nTagmentation fragments DNA with a Tn5 transposase that binds\ntightly to target DNA. High molecular weight segments of DNA\nare extracted and the resulting segments, analogous to a pool\nof fosmid clones, are sequenced to obtain a phased haplotype\n(\nAmini et al., 2014 ). Combining these phased haplotype segments\nwith an initial genome assembly facilitates the constructio n of\nlarge scaﬀolds ( Adey et al., 2014 ).\nConclusions\nCoupling de novoassembly with linkage mapping is a powerful\nway to produce a high-quality reference genome. Map estimati on\nwas originally developed as a genetic tool over 100 years ago\n(\nSturtevant, 1913a,b ) while assembly-speciﬁc algorithms and\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 220\nFierst Pairing linkage maps with assemblies\ntools are still developing. Linkage maps have proven useful in\nmany diﬀerent genome assembly projects, and over the next\nfew years assembly-speciﬁc algorithms and tools will continu e to\nappear. Physical maps generated with emerging technologies ar e\nnow becoming feasible for genome sequencing projects.\nDense linkage maps can both orient and order assembled\nsequences and identify the genetic basis of phenotypic traits .\nLinkage maps are therefore one of the most important tools\nwe have in genetics. Establishing a mapping population takes\ntime, and undertaking a mapping project is a signiﬁcant\ninvestment of resources. However, linkage maps provide high-\nquality sequences that can not result from de novoassembly alone\nand every genome project that can reasonably be coupled with a\nlinkage map, should be coupled with a linkage map.\nAcknowledgments\nFinancial support provided by a grant from the National\nInstitutes of Health (GM096008).
