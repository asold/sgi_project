    "abstract": "The subject matter of this study was the problem of the ECT (electrostatic charging tendency) of mineral insulation oils during their flow. The electrostatic charges generated may lead to partial discharges, and as a consequence, to the breakdown of a power transformer insulation system. In this study, the results of the ECT of mineral oils used in transformers were compared. The method of streaming electrification of insulation liquids using a flow-through system was used. The influence of flow speed, temperature, and the pipe material on the values of the electrification current and volume charge density qw were analyzed. The results obtained in this study should be taken into account regarding the operation of power transformers.",
