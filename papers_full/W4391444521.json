  "abstract": "Protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as potent tools for predicting and designing protein structure and function, and the degree to which these models fundamentally understand the inherent biophysics of protein structure stands as an open question. Motivated by a discovery that pLM-based structure predictors erroneously predict nonphysical structures for protein isoforms, we investigated the nature of sequence context needed for contact predictions in the pLM ESM-2. We demonstrate by use of a “categorical Jacobian” calculation that ESM-2 stores statistics of coevolving residues, analogously to simpler modelling approaches like Markov Random Fields and Multivariate Gaussian models. We further investigated how ESM-2 “stores” information needed to predict contacts by comparing sequence masking strategies, and found that providing local windows of sequence information allowed ESM-2 to best recover predicted contacts. This suggests that pLMs predict contacts by storing motifs of pairwise contacts. Our investigation highlights the limitations of current pLMs and underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of these models. Significance Statement Protein language models (pLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in protein structure prediction and design. However, the extent to which they comprehend the intrinsic biophysics of protein structures remains uncertain. We present a suite of analyses that dissect how the flagship pLM ESM-2 predicts structure. Motivated by a consistent error of protein isoforms predicted as structured fragments, we developed a completely unsupervised method to uniformly evaluate any protein language model that allows for us to compare coevolutionary statistics to older linear models. We further identified t hat E SM-2 a ppears to have a precise context size that is needed to predict inter-residue contacts. Our study highlights the current limitations of pLMs and contributes to a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable protein structure predictions.",
