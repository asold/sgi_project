Many various designs of fault \ncurrent limiters (FCL) were proposed, among them the devices based on the properties of the \nsuperconducting-normal state transition (S-N transition). Inductive, resistive and various “hybrid” \ndesigns of superconducting FCLs were considered in different modifications, based on different \nsuperconducting materials and well described in numerous reviews and reported at international \nconferences [1-5]. Several high power prototypes of superconducting FCLs have been built and \nsuccessfully tested showing feasibility of various proposed concepts for application in power electric \nsystems [6-11]. Besides FCLs, a fault current limiting transformer [12] and a transformer operating as \na circuit-breaker under a fault [13] were proposed. However, all these devices do not prevent breaks in \npower supply of consumers during faults.  A power interruption even during very short faults (0.1-0.2 \ns) is inadmissible for many long-term technological processes.  \nOne conventional method for protection against unexpected breaks in power supplying is using two or \nmore power lines leading from different substations and connected to a load through controlled AC-\nDC or AC-AC converters. During a fault in one line, this line is disconnected by the converter \nelectronics and further power service is realized through undamaged lines. An alternative to building \nof additional power lines is the application of energy storage systems using analogous converters for \ncoupling to a power network [14, 15].  \nAnother approach to the problem of faults and consumption breaks is the development of multi-\nfunctional fast operating systems combining current-limitation and energy distribution functions, \nproviding a fast switching of power flow to a standby line during faults.  \nThis paper is aimed to present the results of the study of the operation of a novel device combining the \nfunctions of a conventional transformer with the functions of fast power redistribution and fault \nprotection. \n  \n2. Design and operation principle \nWe studied the operation of a device shown schematically in Fig. 1, which constitutes a transformer \ncontaining additional coils, one of them is a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coil short-\n 3\ncircuited by a switching HTS element. The operation of the device is based on a fast S-N transition in \nthe switching element.  \nThe transformer consists of a primary coil W 1 , a two-sectional secondary coil with sections W 2 and \nW2’ , a standby secondary coil W 3  and a superconducting coil W 4 placed on the magnetic leg with \ncoils W 2’  and W 3. The sections W 2 and W 2’ are located on different magnetic legs and counter-\nconnected in series so that the voltages induced in the coils are of opposite signs. The superconducting \ncoil is short-circuited by an HTS switching element. \nUnder normal operating conditions, the switching element is in the superconducting state and the coil \nW4 compensates the magnetic flux in the magnetic branch with the coils W2’ and W3 . As a result of it, \nany electromotive forces is not induced in the coils W 2’ and W 3 . The device operates as a usual \ntransformer with the primary coil W 1 and the secondary coil W 2 supplying a consumer. When an \nexcess current caused by an overload or a fault appears in line 1, the current in the section W 2’ \nincreases resulting in the current increase in the coil W 4 and in the switching element. This initiates the \ntransition of the switching element to the normal state. Electromotive forces appear in the coils W 2’ \nand W3 . The numbers of turns in the coils W 2 and W2’ are chosen so that their induced electromotive \nforces are compensated. The voltage of the secondary coil W 2-W2’ decreases drastically and the fault \ncurrent in line 1 is limited. At the same time, standby line 2 is switched on. Thus, the device performs \nsimultaneously two functions: limitation of the current in the line where the fault occurs, and energy \nredistribution providing the uninterrupted energy supply to a consumer. \nThe considered design differs from a transformer-circuit-breaker proposed by Y. Bashkirov  et al. [13] \nby introducing an additional secondary coil. It allows one to expand the functions of the device: along \nwith the fault current limitation, the device provides the continuity of power service due to \nredistribution of power flow to a standby line.  \n  \n3. Experimental model \nThe experimental model of the device was built with the following parameters: the turn numbers of in \nthe coils: W\n1 - 100, W 2 – 50, W2’ - 88, W3 - 100. The HTS coil W4 had 8 turns and was short-circuited \n 4\nby a HTS switching element. The coils were placed on an E-type core with dimensions 150x165x30 \nmm3. \nA Bi-2223/Ag multifilamentary tape used for manufacturing of the HTS coil was fabricated by the \noxide powder-in-tube method [16]. The tape was wound on a cylindrical former with the external \ndiameter of 52 mm and the height of 38 mm. The measurements by the 4-point probe method gave the \ncritical current of 18 A determined with 1 µV/cm criterion. Under AC conditions, the active \ncomponent of the voltage drop across the coil was equal to 20 µV/cm at the current amplitude of 22 A \nand at the temperature of 77 K. \nThe switching element was fabricated on the base of HTS YBCO epitaxial thin film of 300 nm in \nthickness (protected by a gold layer, 100 nm in thickness) deposited by thermal reactive co-\nevaporation on a sapphire substrate of 0.5 mm in thickness [11]. The switch was fabricated in the form \nof a strip with two broad current terminals, active length of 18 mm and width of 2.5 mm. The critical \ntemperature of the film was about 87 K, the critical current of the switch - 10 A at 77 K. \nThe thin film switch and the HTS coil were connected using silver contacts. Resistance of the contacts \nwas less than 0.006 Ω .  The operation of the HTS coil with the thin film switching element was \npreviously investigated in a model of an inductive FCL [17]. \n \n4. Experimental results \nThe testing of the experimental model was carried out in two stages. The secondary coils were \nconnected to different resistors which simulated loads in the main and standby lines. In the first stage, \nthe waves of voltages and currents were recorded in two operating steady-state modes: under normal \nconditions (Fig. 2) and a fault in line 1 (Fig. 3). Under normal conditions, the switching element was in \nthe superconducting state (at a current below the critical value). The voltage induced in the coil W\n3 is \nlow and appears only due to imperfect compensation of the magnetic flux by the superconducting coil.  \nA fault in line 1 was modeled by short-circuiting of the load in the line. As a result of it, the current in \nthe section W2’ increased, the switch was transferred into the normal state and the voltage across the \nsecondary coil W 2-W2’ was decreased and determined by the impedance of the short-circuited line \n 5\n(Fig. 3a). The limited fault current was about twice the nominal current (Fig. 3c). The fault current in \nline 1 without limitation would be about 20 times more than the nominal current. As one can see from \nthe comparison of Figs. 2a and 3a, the voltage supplying standby line 2 during a fault achieved almost \nthe nominal value that was under normal conditions in line 1. \nNote that in Fig. 2 the voltages across the primary and secondary coils are about in opposite phases \nwhile the currents have a shift. It is explained by a relatively low magnetizing reactance in our \nexperimental model and relatively high load resistance and leakage reactance. In full-scale devices, the \nmagnetizing reactance is very high, and the currents must be also in opposite phases. \nThe second stage of the testing was related to investigation of the dynamic characteristics of the \ndevice. A short-circuit regime in line 1 was performed by an electronic switch connected in parallel to \nthe load. A variable resistor was inserted in the circuit in series with the switch. Changing the \nresistance, different cases of remoteness of a fault point from the transformer were modeled. \nFig. 4 presents typical scope traces of transients in the case of remote fault (the fault current was the \nleast). Fault current limitation as well as the appearance of the voltage across the coil W 3 supplying \nstandby line 2 occurred without any delay (Fig. 4c). The recovery of the normal operation of the \ntransformer after a fault clearing was observed in less than a half-period.  \nNote that, during a fault, the device effectively protects the supplying line connected to the primary \ncoil: the voltage and current in the primary coil remain practically the same (Fig. 4a). \n \n5. Mathematical model of the device \nThe mathematical model of the transformer device as a power system element is based on the \nequations of magnetic coupled circuits:  \n 6\n()\n() ()\n() ()\n()\n() sudt\ndiLdt\ndiLdt\ndiLLdt\ndiL\ndt\ndiLdt\ndiLiRdt\ndiLiRdt\ndiLLdt\ndiL\ndt\ndiLLdt\ndiLL\ndt\ndiLiRdt\ndiLLLiRdt\ndiLL\ndt\ndiLdt\ndiLdt\ndiLLdt\ndiLiRu\n+++−+=\n+++++−+=\n−+−+\n+++−++−=\n++−++=\n′\n′\n′′\n′′′′\n′\n4\n44\n3\n34\n2\n4224\n1\n14\n443\n3\n333\n3\n3333323223113\n4\n2442\n3\n2332\n2\n222\n2\n222222222\n1\n2112\n4\n41\n3\n31\n2\n1221\n1\n111111\n0\n0\n(1)                                                                            \n20\n \nwhere u1 is the primary terminal voltage; ii , Rii and Lii are the current, resistance and inductance of the \ncoil Wi ( i = 1,  2,  2` , 3,  4) ; Ri an d Li is t he r esistance and inductance o f t he load co nnected t o t he \nsecondary coil Wi (i = 2, 3);  Lij is the mutual inductance of the coils Wi and Wj . Because the sections \nW2 and W2’  are electrically connected , we put i2 = i2’. The voltage drop us across the superconducting \nswitching element depends o n t he cur rent an d t emperature. A frequently used approximation for the \nvoltage-current characteristic of a superconductor [5, 18] is: \n()\n() ( )[] ()\n\n\n\n≥\n<>−\n<≤\n=\ncsn\nccscss\nccs\ns\nTTiR\nTTTiiTiiiR\nTTTii\nu  and  ifsign\n and  if0\nρ   (2) \nwhere Rρ i s t he r esistance o f t he s uperconductor i n the resistive state (so-called the flux flow \nresistance), Rn is the resistance of the superconductor in the normal state, is is the instantaneous value \nof the current in the superconductor, and ic is its critical current which depends on the temperature T, \nTc is the critical temperature of the superconductor.  \nThe t ransient process is described by t he simultaneous solution of Eqs. (1), (2) and the heat equation \nfor t he s uperconducting el ement. T he ch aracter o f t he t ransient pr ocess af ter is achieves t he cr itical \nvalue is determined by the relationship between the rate of heating of the superconducting element and \nthe rate of the transient current attenuation.  \nAt quick heating of the superconductor, the condition required for a full-scale device, processes of the \nfault and S-N transition can be considered as a s tepwise change of the load in the main line (R2 and L2 \ngo down to zero) and of the resistance of the switching element (from zero to Rn). A peculiarity of the \nconsidered device is that transient currents attenuate quickly due t o relatively large resistances Rn and \n 7\nR3 . This is well illustrated by our experiments with the device model: scope traces in Fig. 4 show that \nthe transient processes are very short and the device operation can be simulated as a jump from one \nsteady state to another. Based on this conclusion, two operating regimes were simulated: 1) normal \noperation when the switching element is in the superconducting state ( R44 ~ 0); 2) fault when R2 is low \nand the switching element is in the normal state with a high resistance.  The simulation results for the \nparameters of our experimental model and for the amplitude of the primary voltage U1 = 15V are \nshown in Figs. 2b and 3b for normal and fault conditions, respectively.  These results are in good \nagreement with the experimental data presented in Figs. 2a and 3a. \n \n6. Discussion  \nThe obtained experimental results have shown the feasibility of the proposed design: the limitation \neffect and power redistribution were achieved without any delay, in time less than ¼ of AC period. \nThe limitation was achieved without overvoltages in the circuit. The S-N transition occurred only in \nthe HTS switch while the secondary HTS coil remained in the superconducting state in all the regimes. \nNon-sinusoidal experimental traces of the voltage and current (Fig. 3) indicate that the resistance of the \nswitch was changed markedly during every AC period due to heat processes. The primary current I1 \ndid not practically change due to fault event while the secondary current I2 increased more than twice \nduring fault conditions (Fig. 4). Emphasize, that this increase is required for the successful operation of \nthe protecting automatics, which has to “see” a fault and to send the command to the circuit breaker to \nopen the circuit. Note also, that compensation of the electromotive forces induced in two sections W 2 \nand W2’ under fault conditions cannot be perfect, even if amplitudes of U2 and U 2\n’ are equal . This is \nexplained by asymmetry of the device resulting to the phase shift between the magnetic fluxes in the \ncentral and side legs of the magnetic core. Therefore  the electromotive forces induced in the sections \nW2 and W 2’ are also shifted. Figs. 4a and 4b demonstrate the recovery of the device to the initial \nconditions in 3-4 periods after a fault clearing. \nThe full-scale device should be built using multifilamentary HTS wires to decrease AC losses in the \nsuperconducting coil. The switching element can be fabricated as a set of HTS films connected in \n 8\nparallel and in s eries s imilarly t o s witching e lements o f F CLs [ 5, 8 , 1 7]. An important technological \nproblem is t o lower t he contact resistance between a HTS wire and films. There are t hree conditions \ndetermining the accessible value of this resistance. First, the contacts have not to be sources of normal \nzone nucleation.  Second, the total resistance of the contacts has to be much less than the impedance of \nthe secondary HT S co il. Third, t he r estriction o n t he r esistance value is dictated by the economically \nsound level of power losses under a normal regime of the protected circuit. \nIf the current in a line is higher t han double t he maximum of t he rated current in t he normal regime, \nthis regime is  c onsidered a s a  fa ult. T his c ondition d etermines t he r equired c ritical c urrent o f t he \nswitching element: when the instantaneous current in the circuit of the coils W2 and W2’ exceeds twice \nthe n ominal cur rent am plitude, t he cur rent i n t he s uperconducting s witch h as t o ach ieve t he cr itical \nvalue. \nThe cr itical cur rent can b e calculated us ing equat ions ( 1). Ho wever, with s atisfactory accur acy, it is \ndetermined by the ratio of the turn numbers in the coil W2’ and the superconducting coil. \nThe r esistance Rn o f t he s witching e lement in  t he limit ation r egime is  d etermined b y several \nconditions. T he f irst co ndition r equires t hat t he s uperconducting co il W 4 do es n ot i nfluence o n t he \nmagnetic flux distribution when the superconducting switch is in the normal state. It is achieved if: \ng = Rn/ X44 >> 1.     ( 3) \nThe estimations show that g = 5 is sufficient [5,17]. Under condition (3), the reduced resistance of the \nswitch in the normal state is much higher than all the load impedances. Therefore, almost whole of the \npower goes to the load through the standby line. \nThe s econd limiting c ondition fo r R n f ollows f rom t he r estrictions o n di ssipated energy to prevent \noverheating o f t he s witching element. The dissipated en ergy dur ing t he time of a fault, tk , is mainly \ndetermined by the turns ratio of the primary and superconducting coils: \nmax\nn\nk QR\nt\nW\nWU ≤\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2\n1\n41\n22\n ,    (4 ) \nwhere Qmax is the maximum admissible dissipated energy in the switching element.  \n 9\nDimensions of the switching element can be evaluated using the formula given in [5, 17] for fault \ncurrent limiters. It is expected that the parameters of superconducting elements will be close to the \nparameters of these elements for an inductive FCL of the same power. For example, the parameters of \n11kV/600A superconducting FCL were presented in [5, 17]. To calculate the parameters of the \nelectromagnetic system, the methods developed for conventional transformers can be apply [19, 20].  \nIt should be noted that, for our transformer device, there is no a short-circuit regime, such as for \nconventional transformers: the primary current and voltage do not practically change at the fault in the \nmain line (Fig. 4).  Thus, the device protects  the primary circuits of transformers against the current \nincrease and voltage reduction during faults: the property unavailable for other fault current limiters.  \nThe proposed transformer device can be used for uninterrupted supply of long-term technological \nprocesses. Economical gain from the device application should be determined from the comparison \nwith other solutions as building an additional substation or using of energy storage systems. The \nproposed device uses the same converters which are needed for conventional methods. The main and \nstandby lines are connected to the input terminal of a converter which disconnects the fault line. An \nadditional advantage of the proposed device, in the comparison with the conventional methods, is the \nlimitation of fault currents in both the primary circuit and the faulted line. \nThe results of our investigations have shown that the proposed device meets the basic requirements \nfollowing from the above considered application: quick (in less than ¼ of AC period) switching of the \npower between the main and standby lines and quick (a few periods) recovery to the initial conditions \nafter a fault clearing. The switching between different modes occurs without dangerous overvoltages. \n \n6. Conclusion \nThe performed investigations have confirmed the feasibility of the proposed design. The experiments \nhave shown that the system “superconducting coil – switch” can be used as a module for controlling \nthe magnetic flux distribution in transformer devices. It opens ways for developing designs realizing \nthe fault current limitation simultaneously with the redistribution of power flows to standby lines. This \nfeature provides uninterrupted supply of consumers even during a fault event.  \n 10\n \nAcknowledgements - This research was supported by the Ministry of Infrastructure of Israel through \nthe Grant “Development of Transformer Device with Superconducting Coil for Controlling Current \nand Energy Distribution in Electric Power Network”, 2001-2004.
