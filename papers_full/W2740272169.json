    "abstract": "This article presents an algorithm for modelling an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for power transformer paper conditions in order to estimate the transformer’s expected life. The dielectric characteristics, dissolved gasses, and furfural of 108 running transformers were collected, which were divided into 76 training datasets and another 32 testing datasets. The degree of polymerization (DP) of the transformer paper was predicted using the ANFIS model based on using the dielectric characteristics and dissolved gases as input. These inputs were analyzed, and the best combination was selected, whereas CO + CO2, acidity, interfacial tension, and color were correlated with the paper’s deterioration condition and were chosen as the input variables. The best combination of input variables and membership function was selected to build the optimal ANFIS model, which was then compared and evaluated. The proposed ANFIS model has 89.07% training accuracy and 85.75% testing accuracy and was applied to a transformer paper insulation assessment and an estimation of the expected life of four Indonesian transformers for which furfural data is unavailable. This proposed algorithm can be used as a furfural alternative for the general assessment of transformer paper conditions and the estimation of expected life and provides a helpful assistance for experts in transformer condition assessment.",
