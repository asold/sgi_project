  "abstract": "Several recent efforts have been devoted to enhancing pre-trained language\\nmodels (PLMs) by utilizing extra heterogeneous knowledge in knowledge graphs\\n(KGs) and achieved consistent improvements on various knowledge-driven NLP\\ntasks. However, most of these knowledge-enhanced PLMs embed static sub-graphs\\nof KGs (\"knowledge context\"), regardless of that the knowledge required by PLMs\\nmay change dynamically according to specific text (\"textual context\"). In this\\npaper, we propose a novel framework named Coke to dynamically select contextual\\nknowledge and embed knowledge context according to textual context for PLMs,\\nwhich can avoid the effect of redundant and ambiguous knowledge in KGs that\\ncannot match the input text. Our experimental results show that Coke\\noutperforms various baselines on typical knowledge-driven NLP tasks, indicating\\nthe effectiveness of utilizing dynamic knowledge context for language\\nunderstanding. Besides the performance improvements, the dynamically selected\\nknowledge in Coke can describe the semantics of text-related knowledge in a\\nmore interpretable form than the conventional PLMs. Our source code and\\ndatasets will be available to provide more details for Coke.\\n",
