    "abstract": "Access to high-quality dental healthcare remains a challenge in many countries due to limited resources, lack of trained professionals, and time-consuming report generation tasks. An intelligent clinical decision support system (ICDSS), which can make informed decisions based on past data, is an innovative solution to address these shortcomings while improving continuous patient support in dental healthcare. This study proposes a viable solution with the aid of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), focusing on their application for generating orthopantomography radiology reports and answering questions in the dental domain. This work also discusses efficient adaptation methods of LLMs for specific language and application domains. The proposed system primarily consists of a Blip-2-based caption generator tuned on DPT images followed by a Llama 3 8B based LLM for radiology report generation. The performance of the entire system is evaluated in two ways. The diagnostic performance of the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.3%, with specific detection rates of 87.9% for dental caries, 89.7% for impacted teeth, 88% for bone loss, and 81.8% for periapical lesions. Subjective evaluation of AI-generated radiology reports by certified dental professionals demonstrates an overall accuracy score of 7.5 out of 10. In addition, the proposed solution includes a question-answering platform in the native Sinhala language, alongside the English language, designed to function as a chatbot for dental-related queries. We hope that this platform will eventually bridge the gap between dental services and patients, created due to a lack of human resources. Overall, our proposed solution creates new opportunities for LLMs in healthcare by introducing a robust end-to-end system for the automated generation of dental radiology reports and enhancing patient interaction and awareness.",
