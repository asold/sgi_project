  "abstract": "Backgrounds: The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen a major shift in recent years due to the development of new Machine Learning (ML) models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and AI which are progressively becoming part our everyday lives. GPT has achieved previously unheard-of levels of accuracy in most computerized language processing tasks and their chat-based variations. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the problem-solving abilities of ChatGPT using two sets of verbal insight problems, with a known performance level established by a sample of human participants. Material and Methods: A total of 30 problems labelled as “practice problems” and “transfer problems”, as listed by Ansburg and Dominowski (2000), were administered to ChatGPT. The answers provided by ChatGPT received a score of &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; for each problem answered incorrectly and a score of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; for each correct response, as per the correct solution specified in Ansburg and Dominowski's (2000) study. The highest score that could be attributed to both the practice and transfer problems was 15 out of 15. In order to compare ChatGPT performance to the performance to that of human subjects, the solution rate for each problem (based on a sample of 20 subjects) was used, as indicated by Ansburg and Dominowski (2000). Results: The study highlighted that ChatGPT can be trained in out-of-the-box thinking and demonstrated potential in solving verbal insight problems. The global performance of ChatGPT equalled the most probable outcome for the human sample in both practice problems and transfer problems as well as upon their combination. Additionally, ChatGPT answer combinations were among the 5% of most probable outcomes for the human sample both when considering practice problems and pooled problem sets. These findings demonstrate that ChatGPT performance on both set of problems was in line with the mean rate of success of human subjects, indicating that it performed reasonably well. Conclusions: The use of transformer architecture and self-attention in ChatGPT may have helped to prioritize inputs while predicting, contributing to its potential in verbal insight problem-solving. ChatGPT has shown potential in solving insight problems, thus highlighting the importance of incorporating AI in psychological research. However, it is acknowledged that open challenges still exist. Indeed, further research is needed to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of AI in insight problem-solving.",
