  "abstract": "Leakage problems occur from time to time due to the large number of equipment and complex processes during oil and gas production and transportation. The traditional detection methods highly depend on manpower with large workload and are prone to missed and false alarms, which seriously affects the efficiency and safety of oil and gas production and transportation. With the continuous improvement of information technology and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the research on leakage detection technology based on AI methods has attracted more and more attention. This paper discusses the application scenarios of an AI agent based on the recently emerged large language model (LLM) technology in oil and gas production leakage detection: (1) Compared with the traditional leakage detection methods, this paper innovatively employs a combination of AI-based diagnostics and infrared temperature measurement technologies to develop a specialized small model for oil and gas leakage detection, which has been proven to significantly improve the accuracy of detecting industrial venting events in natural gas valve chambers; (2) By employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology, a knowledge vector library is constructed, utilizing a series of leakage-related documents, assisting the LLM to carry out knowledge questioning and inference. Compared with the traditional SimBERT, the accuracy can be improved by about 15% in the Q&amp;A search ability test. The correct rate is about 70% higher than the SimBERT in the Chinese complex reasoning quiz. Also, it can still remain stable under high load conditions, with the interruption rate of retrieval closing to zero. (3) By combining the specialized small model and the knowledge Q&amp;A tool, the natural gas valve chambers’ leakage detection AI agent based on the open-source LLM model was designed and developed, which preliminarily achieved the leakage detection based on the specialized small model, and the automatic processing of the retrieval reasoning process based on the knowledge Q&amp;A tool and the intelligent generation of corresponding leakage disposal scheme. The effectiveness of the method has been verified by actual project data. This article conducts preliminary explorations into the in-depth applications of AI agents based on LLMs in the oil and gas energy industry, demonstrating certain positive outcomes.",
