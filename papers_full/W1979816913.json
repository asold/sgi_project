The largest potential health benefits have\nbeen identified as being from increases in physical activity, with\nadditional benefits from reductions in air pollution but a potential\nincrease in road traffic injuries.\nThe Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project, (Visions 2030)\nconsidered alternative scenarios for the UK for the year 2030 in\nwhich walking and cycling play a central role in urban\ntransportation. In this study we quantified scenarios for urban\nareas (population greater than 10,000 [4]) in England and Wales\noutside London based on Visions 2030 [5] and modelled their\nimpact on population health and greenhouse gas emissions.\nLondon was excluded because travel patterns are different from\nother urban areas in the UK (higher public transport and lower\ncar use) and because London was covered in an earlier study [2].\nMethods\nKey assumptions used in this modelling study are shown in\nTable 1.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e51462\nHealth Impact Modelling tool\nThis study used an Integrated Transport and Health Impact\nModel (ITHIM) to model the changes to population exposures of\nphysical activity, air pollution and road traffic injury risk. ITHIM\nwas developed out of the work published in Woodcock et al 2009\n[2] and a similar model was used in Maizlish et al 2013 [6]. The\nspreadsheet is available from Dr James Woodcock on request.\nITHIM models physical activity exposures by comparing\ndistributions of weekly physical activity under different scenarios.\nA comparative risk assessment method is used to estimate how\nchanges in population physical activity and air pollution exposures\nresult in changes in health outcomes. Road traffic injuries are\nmodelled using a risk, distance and speed based model.\nDescription of the Visions and scenarios\nWe developed three quantified scenarios based on the ‘‘Visions\nof the Role of Walking and Cycling in 2030’’ research [5] (see also\nhttp://www.visions2030.org.uk/) and compared these against a\nbaseline scenario. For the baseline scenario data from a variety of\nsources, including the UK National Travel Survey, Transport\nStatistics for Great Britain, and Stats19, were used (see Table 2). In\nVision 0 (baseline) individuals’ mean walking time was 12.5 min-\nutes per day and individuals’ mean cycling time 0.9 minutes per\nday.\nThe three Visions each represent a different image of (or vision\nfor) the UK urban environment in 2030 with substantially higher\nlevels of walking and cycling than is currently the case. Figure 1\nshows visualisations corresponding to each of the Visions for an\nurban terrace street. Complete data for each Vision are shown in\nTable 3.\nIn the process of creating the Visions, which included an\nanimation of the city in each vision, modal shares were determined\nand a storyline created to describe the city and allow inference of\nchanges in travel behaviour. Compared with the current situation\n(Vision 0), in Vision 1 walking and cycling levels are higher (mean\nminutes per day walking 14.1 and cycling 6.4), assuming a strong\ntrend toward the level currently seen in Dutch cities, while car use\nis much lower, assuming a trend towards London levels. Socially\nand economically, Vision 1, is similar to the present day. Vision 2\nassumes a far greater emphasis upon social sustainability, with\nincreased egalitarianism, social inclusion and social justice. It\nincludes even higher levels of walking and cycling (mean minutes\nper day walking 16.8 and cycling 9.5) than Vision 1 and a very low\nshare for car travel (5%), while public transport takes a much\nlarger share of the demand for urban travel than is the case in\nVision 0 or 1. Vision 3 occurs in a society that has become very\nenergy conscious due to a widespread shortage of fuel, and in\nwhich travel is primarily on foot or by bicycle (mean minutes per\nday walking 21.6 and cycling 18.2).Compared with Vision 2, there\nis less use of public transport and increased use of small light\nelectric vehicles with speeds similar to bicycles.\nThe data for the various Visions were obtained or assumed as\nfollows. For Vision 0, actual data were obtained using the sources\nnamed above for the years 2002 to 2008. For Visions 1, data on\nwalking and cycling use (including distance and time travelled)\nfrom different European ‘best practice’ settings were used\nTable 1.Key assumptions in the health impact modelling.\nAssumption Sensitivity analyses\nN Non-linear relationship between physical activity and health outcomes N Alternative relationships tested\nN Population physical activity treated as age group and sex specific log normal\ndistributions with minimum threshold of 2.5 MET hours per week1\nN Tested by comparison with HEAT models based on mean time spent walking\nand mean time spent cycling\nN Road traffic injuries a non-linear product of distance travelled by each mode,\naverage motor traffic speed, and baseline injuries for each pairwise\ncombination of modes\nN Linear model tested; exclusion of speed model tested\nN Air pollution only modelled PM 2.5; assumed that reduction in emissions\nfrom road transport led to equal proportional reduction in primary PM\nconcentrations attributed to road transport\nN Assumed proportional reduction in national emissions from all sources led to\nproportional reduction in total concentrations (including primary and secondary\nsources)\nPM 2.5 = particulate matter,2.5 nanometres diameter.\n1Median non-travel physical activity was added to travel physical activity for breast cancer, colon cancer, dementia, and depression but not for ischemic heart disease,\ncerebrovascular disease, or diabetes because walking specific relative risks were used for these three disease groups.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051462.t001\nTable 2.Key data sources for baseline scenario.\nDataset Years Geographic coverage Used for Description of data\nUK National Travel Surveys 2002–2008 People living in English and Welsh\nurban areas outside London\nPerson based travel (time,\ndistance and speeds) Baseline\nratios of walking time and cycling\ntime to reference group\nSelf-reported weekly travel diary\nTransport Statistics Great\nBritain\n2002–2008 English and Welsh urban areas\nexcluding London\nVehicle travel distances Official statistics based on traffic\ncounts and modelled flows\nStats19 2002–2008 English and Welsh urban areas\nexcluding London\nSerious injuries and fatalities by\nvictim mode and striking vehicle\nPolice reported injuries and fatalities\nHealth Survey for England 2008 English and Welsh urban areas\nexcluding London\nNon-travel physical activity Self-reported physical activity\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051462.t002\nHealth Impacts of Active Travel in England & Wales\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e51462\n(Netherlands, London, Denmark) as reference to elicit the input\ninto the model. There are currently no cities with levels of walking\nand cycling as envisaged in Visions 2 and 3 and the input data for\nthe model were obtained through elicitation of expert opinion. In\nthis process, Visions 0 and 1 were used as a reference and\ncombined with the storylines of Visions 2 and 3 to estimate\nchanges in travel behaviour. An iterative set of discussions amongst\nthe research team resulted in input data to the model (e.g. travel\ndistance by mode) that is consistent with the Visions description\nand mode shares. A full description of the Visions can be found in\n[5].\nWith societal and economic changes, for example high fuel\nprices in Vision 3, substantial changes in modes shares and travel\nbehaviour are expected. For the purpose of modelling the health\neffects of the transport changes taking place within the Visions the\nconcern is with travel distances, travel times, travel speeds andwho\nis doing the travelling. These allow estimation of exposures of\nphysical activity, air pollution and road traffic danger. Societal\nchanges in Visions 2 and 3 might be expected to lead to substantial\nchanges in health exposures and outcomes beyond those directly\narising from changes in transport. Even without these changes\nhealth outcomes would be anticipated to change by 2030.\nHowever, for the purpose of modelling the health effects resulting\nfrom changes in the transport mode shares and assumed changes\nin travel behaviour, only the ‘transport’ effect was considered.\nIn the scenarios with increased use of typically slower transport\nmodes (primarily walking and to a lesser extent cycling) either\ntravel times have to increase or travel distances have to fall. We\nmodelled a small increase in mean travel times (e.g. from\n56 minutes to 61 minutes per day in Vision 3) and a larger fall\nin travel distances (e.g. 28 km per day to 17 km per day in Vision\n3), see Table 3.\nBased on the changes occurring in the Visions we also modelled\na reduction in freight (heavy goods vehicles and light goods\nvehicles) distance: a 13% reduction from baseline in Vision 1, 30%\nin Vision 2, and 39% in Vision 3. In the Visions policies to\nencourage active transport was assumed to result in the distance\nfreight vehicles travelled on minor roads falling more than the\ndistance on major roads or motorways. Some of the increase in\ncycling and use of alternative electric vehicles in Visions 2 and 3\nwould be for final stage freight deliveries [5]. This approach fits\nwith earlier proposals for measures to reduce urban mortality\namongst cyclists from heavy goods vehicles [7].\nA number of factors were assumed to lead to changes in speeds\nby mode. Reduced waiting times and better infrastructure were\nassumed to increase speeds for cyclists and pedestrians. Increased\nfitness was also assumed to increase walking speeds. For motor\nvehicles, traffic calming and speed controls on driver behaviour,\nwith automatic speed reduction, were assumed to result in slower\ntraffic speeds and greater conformity to speed limits. Direct effects\nof changes to congestion on speed were not modelled but might\nnot increase average speeds in a context of road space allocation to\npedestrians and cyclists, and other substantial changes to road\ndesign.\nPhysical activity\nA simplified schematic representation of the physical activity\nmodel is shown in Figure S1.\nFor each scenario we used ITHIM to convert mean whole\npopulation walking and cycling times to age group and sex specific\ndistributions of metabolic equivalent of task (MET) hours per week\n[8]. First, we calculated how walking and cycling times vary by age\ngroup and by sex by using ratios of walking time and cycling time\nto a reference age and sex group. For Vision 0, these ratios were\nFigure 1.

To estimate\nwalking and cycling times for people aged 70 to 79 years and 80\nyears and over we used ratios calculated from the London Travel\nDemand Survey 2005 to 2008 [10] and applied these to the\nNational Travel Survey age band of 70 years and over. For all\nother scenarios ratios were informed by those observed in the\nNetherlands Travel Survey 2005 [11]. The age and sex ratios are\nshown in Table 4.\nWe then combined walking and cycling time to give total active\ntravel time. As time spent walking and cycling is skewed to the\nright, we fitted log normal distributions for each demographic\ngroup. The standard deviation was specified to represent the\nweekly active travel distribution. The coefficient of variation for\neach distribution was assumed to fall as average time spent in\nactive travel increased.

It was assumed that\nthese activities would not change across the scenarios. For each\nquintile of walking and cycling activity in HSE within each\ndemographic group we estimated weekly MET values for activity\nfrom all the other domains (see Table S1). These quintile specific\nmedian MET values were added to the active travel quintile\nspecific median MET values to estimate total physical activity\nexposure.\nIn Vision 3, in which there is an uptake of small light electric\nvehicles (including electric bikes and mobility scooters), simplifying\nassumptions were made that these were not physically active\nmodes and that the risk of injury was the same as for pedal cycles.\nModelling health impacts. In the health impact model\nmedian MET hours per week of active travel or total physical\nactivity for each quintile of the MET hours distribution were used\nas the measures of physical activity exposure. Separate distribu-\ntions were used for each age and sex group. The change in\nexposure was the change in median MET hours for each quintile\nof the distribution comparing each Vision with baseline. How the\nage and sex specific disease burdens would change under each\nscenario was then modelled using a comparative risk assessment\napproach [13].\nThe impact of physical activity on different diseases was based\non the systematic overview in Woodcock et al 2009 [2], (Table 5).\nFor type II diabetes [14] and cardiovascular disease [15], relative\nrisks were taken from systematic reviews based on walking alone,\ntherefore, only active travel exposure was considered. For breast\ncancer [16], colon cancer [17], dementia [18], and depression [19]\nrelative risks were taken from systematic reviews and other studies\ncombining physical activity from multiple domains. It was\nassumed the same relative risks applied to premature deaths,\nyears of life lost, and years of healthy life lost due to disability.\nStudies suggest that the relationship between physical activity and\nhealth outcomes is strongly curvilinear, with the greatest benefit\nfrom moving from low to moderate levels of activity [20,21].\nHowever, the shape of the relationship for different diseases is\nuncertain. Given the evidence of a curvilinear relationship in\ngeneral but an absence of evidence on the shape of the relationship\nfor specific diseases it was assumed, in the main analysis, that\nchanges in disease risk were log linearly associated with a power\n0.5 transformation of the exposure.\nThe log normal distribution approach for modelling physical\nactivity assumes everyone undertakes some active travel. However,\nin the cohort studies used to estimate dose response relationships\nbetween physical activity and health outcomes people doing less\nthan a certain amount of physical activity would be classified as\ninactive. Therefore, a minimum threshold of 2.5 MET hours per\nweek was assumed for any benefit from physical activity (this is\nequivalent to an average daily total of fewer than 10 minutes per\nday of slow walking).\nFigure 2.

We\nused data that were not age weighted or discounted.\nSensitivity analysis. To investigate the sensitivity of the\nanalysis to changes in the parameters and model structure we ran\nmultiple sensitivity analyses.\nWe considered alternative dose response functions based on\nalternative transformations of the exposure (no transformation,\nlog, power 0.375, and power 0.25) and using values from a\nseparate meta-analysis of physical activity and ischemic heart\ndisease, which fitted cubic splines, (Table 5) [21].\nWe directly modelled the impact of changes to physical activity\nexposure on all-cause mortality rather than modelling disease\nspecific mortality. Exposure response functions for all-cause\nmortality taken from Woodcock 2010 [20] were used for total\nphysical activity and for walking alone, (Table 5).\nThe World Health Organization HEAT tools for walking and\ncycling model changes in premature deaths from changes to\nwalking and cycling, respectively [23] [24]. They use a log-linear\nmodel, i.e. the exposure variable is not transformed. Additionally,\nthe HEAT tools are only intended to be applied to populations\naged under 75 years for walking and under 65 years for cycling,\nwhereas the ITHIM tool models impacts from changes in physical\nactivity to all age groups over 30 years old. We ran multiple\ncomparisons with the HEAT tools and the values they provided.\nFirstly, using ITHIM, we applied the exposure response\nfunctions recommended for the WHO HEAT tools for cycling\n[23] and for walking [24] (Table 5). The relative risks were then\nseparately applied to the change in total active travel (i.e. walking\nand cycling combined). Next, we ran models with and without the\nage restrictions – that is, assuming no effect on those aged.74\nyears when using the relative risks for walking or.64 years when\nusing the relative risks for cycling. To facilitate comparability with\nthe main results from ITHIM we modelled the impact on both\npremature deaths and years of life lost, but not on years of healthy\nlife lost due to disability.\nSecondly, the HEAT tools for cycling and walking were directly\nused to estimate the percentage reductions in deaths due to\nchanges in cycling activity and walking activity, respectively. We\nreport both the results assuming an effect on the whole population\nas well as adjusted results. These adjusted results were estimated\nby calculating the proportion of all deaths in our study population\noccurring amongst people aged under 75 (for walking) and 65 (for\ncycling), and multiplying this proportion by the percentage\nchanges in total deaths. We combined the impact fractions from\nthe HEAT walking model and the HEAT cycling model assuming\na multiplicative rather than additive relationship to reduce the risk\nof double counting.\nThe ratio of time spent walking and cycling by different age\ngroups was assumed to differ between the Visions, becoming more\nin line with that of the Netherlands as cycling increases (Table 4).\nTo investigate the sensitivity of the model to these changes, we\nmodelled the impact of changes in total population activity levels\nassuming that age and gender ratios remained constant.\nInjury risk\nIn this study we used a risk, distance and speed based modelling\napproach. Changes in the distance travelled by motor vehicle\ntraffic and by pedestrians and cyclists in the transportation\nscenarios are likely to affect the number of road traffic injuries and\nwho is injured. We developed a model to generate absolute\nnumbers, rather than relative risks, of deaths and serious injuries\nfrom road traffic collisions. A simplified schematic of the road\ntraffic injury model is shown in Figure S2.\nWe treated all injuries as being either the result of a collision\nbetween a striking vehicle and a victim vehicle occupant (or\npedestrian) or being the result of a collision involving no other\nvehicle. For collisions involving multiple vehicles we categorised\nthe largest vehicle as the striking vehicle. The model is based on\nchanges to distance travelled by striking vehicle modes, changes to\ndistance travelled by victim mode and on changes to motor vehicle\nspeed. Changes to distance are applied to the numbers of injuries\nsuffered by users of a given mode involved in a collision with\nanother given mode. A related modelling approach was proposed\nby Bhalla et al [25] in which a two stage process was used to\ncalculate collisions and then injuries. The current study used a one\nstage approach to directly calculate injuries and fatalities. This\nmodel is closely related to that applied previously for California [6]\nand London [2] but different parameters were used in this current\nstudy.\nWe analysed routinely collected UK Police data from the\nStats19 database [26] from 2002–2008 to separately estimate the\nnumber of victims seriously injured and killed in collisions with\neach type of vehicle. It was assumed that injury risks would differ\non major and minor roads. Therefore, separate tables of injuries\nwere extracted from Stats19 for injuries on each of the road types;\nmotorway, A road, and minor road. Where collisions occurred at a\njunction between two road types, the higher road classification was\nused. Collisions were geocoded using ArcGis and we selected\ninjuries that occurred in urban areas in England and Wales outside\nLondon. The Stats19 classification of injuries (fatal, severe and\nminor) was used. A ‘fatal’ injury is defined as those cases in which\ndeath occurs in fewer than 30 days as a result of the collision.\n‘Serious’ injuries are following hospital admission an in-patient\neither immediately or later. Minor injuries were not considered\ndue to reporting inaccuracies [27]. To illustrate the structure of the\ndata, values for serious injuries on minor roads are shown in Table\nS2.\nWe modelled changes in the number of people injured in\ncollisions involving each combination of modes based on changes\nin person distance (for victims) and vehicle distance (for striking\nvehicles). Person distance and vehicle distance are related through\nmode specific occupancy rates. We took empirical estimates\nprovided by Elvik [28] that suggest increases in distance either by\nstriking vehicle or by victim mode lead to a less than proportional\nincrease in injuries. The formulae are presented below.\nX\nr\nX\ni\nX\nv\nX\ns\nCsv\nl2v\nl1v\n/C18/C19 avs /C3 l2s\nl1s\n/C18/C19 bsv\nIf s ~no other vehicle , l2v\nl1v\n/C18/C19 avs\n:1\nN r = road type (motorway, major, minor)\nN i = injury type (fatal, serious)\nN v = victim mode (pedestrian, cyclist, motorcyclist, car occu-\npant, LGV occupant, bus occupant, HGV occupant)\nN s = striking mode (bike, motorbike, car, LGV, bus, HGV, no\nother vehicle)\nN C = casualties for a given victim mode and striking vehicle at\nbaseline\nN l2 = distance by mode in scenario\nN l1 = distance by mode at baseline\nHealth Impacts of Active Travel in England & Wales\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e51462\nN If victim mode is cyclist or pedestrian then bsv = 0.7 &\navs = 0.5 (cyclist) or 0.4 (pedestrian)\nN If victim mode is one of (motorcyclist, car occupant, LGV\noccupant, bus occupant, HGV occupant) then bsv and\navs = 0.525\nN If striking vehicle is no other vehicle thenavs = 0.8\nThese values are such that for collisions involving a motor\nvehicle with a bike or pedestrian, a doubling of motor vehicle\ndistance leads to a 62% increase in injuries amongst cyclists and\npedestrians, while for victims a doubling of distance by cyclists\nleads to a 41% increase in cyclist injuries and a doubling of\ndistance by pedestrians leads to a 32% increase in pedestrians\ninjuries. For collisions solely involving motor vehicles, a doubling\nof distance by striking vehicle or victim vehicle would lead to a\n44% increase in injuries (2\n‘0.525). For the risk of collisions in\nwhich the striking vehicle and victim mode are the same then,\nautomatically, a doubling of distance by victim mode would imply\na doubling of distance victim by striking mode. In this case, a\ndoubling of distance would lead to an increase in the number of\ninjuries of 107% ((2\n‘0.525)‘2). For collisions involving only one\nvehicle, a doubling of distance would lead to a 74% increase in\ninjuries.\nVehicle speed is a strong risk factor for collisions and severity of\ninjury. Therefore, we adapted a simple version of the speed model\ndescribed by Cameron & Elvik [29] to model how changes to\nspeed would affect injuries. In this modelling method, the\nrelationship between speed and injury risk is strongly non-linear\nand is based on different power transformations for different road\ntypes. To represent changes to speeds on these roads it was\nassumed that for each Vision the specified change in average car\nspeed for shorter car trips equated to the change in average speed\non minor roads, and the change in average car speed for longer\ncar trips equated to the change in average speed on major roads\nand motorways. It was also assumed that the speed model could\nonly be robustly applied to collisions in which cars, light goods\nvehicles or motorbikes were the striking vehicle.\nspeed scenario\nspeed baseline\n/C18/C19 a\na = 3.5 for motorways and 2 for major and minor roads\nChanges in the demographic structure of travel by different\nmodes may affect the changes in disease burden as loss of life in an\nolder age group is calculated as fewer years of life lost than a death\nat a younger age. The simplifying assumption was made that the\ntotal numbers of injuries by mode were not affected by changes in\nwho was cycling or walking but that the modelled change in\ninjuries among cyclists and pedestrians was distributed across\ndemographic groups according to the change in time spent\nwalking and cycling in each demographic group. The change in\ndisease burden was measured as DALYs, years of life lost, and\nyears of healthy life lost to disability. To calculate this from\nchanges to numbers of serious injuries and fatalities, we assumed\nthe ratios of deaths to years of life lost due to deaths was a constant\nwithin each demographic group based on the data provided in the\nWHO disease burden data, and the ratio of years of life lost to\nyears of healthy life lost due to disability to injuries was a constant\nwithin each demographic group.\nSensitivity analysis. We undertook sensitivity analyses\nvarying the relationship between the changes in distance for each\nmode and changes in number of injuries. Firstly we assumed that\ninjuries changed with the square root of the ratio of distance in the\nscenario to distance at baseline for both victim mode and striking\nvehicle (as used in the California application of ITHIM [6]) and\nsecondly we assumed a simple linear relationship between injury\nand distance (as used in the modelling for London and Delhi [2]).\nWe also ran the model excluding the speed module.\nAir pollution\nA simple model was used to estimate the health impacts from\nchanges to air pollution. We used published data that provides\nconcentrations of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres\n(PM 2.5) and source apportionment (for primary PM) for each\n1 kilometre (km) square grid in the UK [30]. Combining this data\nwith data from the 2001 census we calculated population weighted\nPM 2.5 for urban areas in England and Wales outside London\n[31]. These data were weighted by age group specific population\ndata (age groups: 0 to 4, 30 to 59, and 60+). We then took data on\nexhaust pipe and tyre wear emissions per km for each vehicle type\nfor urban areas by road type for 2008 from the UK National Air\npollution Emissions Inventory; see Table S3 [32].\nThe distance travelled under each scenario for each vehicle type\nwas multiplied by the emission factors for that mode to produce\nestimates of the change in total transport emissions. The\nassumption was made that emission factors were constant across\nall the Visions. Finally we assumed that a change in urban\ntransport emissions translated into a proportional change in\nprimary PM 2.5 attributable to urban transport. The effect of\nchanges in traffic congestion on air pollution was not modelled. A\nsimplified schematic of the air pollution model is shown in Figure\nS3.\nTo calculate health impacts from changes to PM exposure we\nused the values recommended by the WHO [33], (Table 6).\nChanges to deaths and years of life lost were modelled across all\ncardio-respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and for acute respiratory\ninfections in children aged less than 5 years.\nBoth air pollution and physical activity affect the risk of\ncardiovascular diseases and so to reduce the risk of double\ncounting we assumed that percentage reductions in the disease\nburden were multiplicative rather than additive.\nSensitivity analysis. A second, simpler approach was used\nfor sensitivity analysis that aimed to capture in broad terms\nchanges in secondary PM. In this model, we took national values\nfor the proportion of PM 2.5 emissions, including from natural\nsources, due to road transport and assumed a proportional\nreduction in total concentrations (based on the weighted average\nfor the urban population of England and Wales) equivalent to the\npercentage reduction in emissions [34].\nCarbon dioxide\nFor carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, we used mode specific\nemission factors from the National Atmospheric Emissions\nTable 6.Air pollution health impact model.\nModel Coefficient\nCardio-respiratory (age.= 30) RR = exp(b( 61–62) b = 0.00893\nLung cancer (age.= 30) RR = exp(b( 61–62) b = 0.01267\nAcute respiratory infections (age,5) RR = exp(b( 61–62) b = 0.00332\n61 = exposure baseline.\n62 = exposure scenario.\nGBD cause groups.

The assumption made was that emission\nfactors were constant across all the scenarios (see Table S4). Based\non the changes in vehicle km by road type we modelled the change\nin CO\n2 emissions for vehicle distance by passenger transport, both\nprivate motor vehicles and buses.\nSoftware for data analyses\nData analyses were conducted in Stata 11 (STATA Corpora-\ntion) and ArcGIS (Esri).

In all scenarios, there\nwas a reduction in the disease burden with the largest contribution\ncoming from increases in physical activity, followed by fewer road\ntraffic injuries. The largest health gains were from changes in\nischemic heart disease, stroke, and dementia, followed by\nreductions in injuries (Visions 2 and 3) or diabetes (Vision 1);\nfull data are shown in Table 8. The percentage reduction in\ndifferent diseases affected by physical activity varied according to\n1) the strength of the relationship between physical activity and the\nhealth outcome, 2) the changes in exposure in different\ndemographic groups.\nFigure 3.

To put these figures\ninto the context of more general values, the WHO estimates that\nfor high income countries as a group lack of physical activity is\nresponsible for 7.7% of disease burden (using different relative\nrisks from those used in this study), with overweight and obesity an\nadditional 8.4% and tobacco 17.9% [35].\nRoad traffic injuries\nWe found a reduction in the disease burden from road traffic\ninjuries (DALYs) in all scenarios: 16% in Vision 1, 58% in Vision\n2, and 59% in Vision 3. The changes in fatalities and serious\ninjuries by mode are given in Tables 9 and 10 respectively.\nIn Vision 1 we found an increase in injuries amongst women\naged over 45 and in men aged over 60 (figures not shown).\nHowever, these increases were outweighed by the other health\ngains from increases in physical activity for both of these age\ngroups, suggesting a net benefit in all age groups.\nAir pollution\nParticulate matter from transport was reduced by approximate-\nly two thirds in Vision 3 and total exposure to particulate matter\nwas reduced by 0.1 mm in Vision 1, 0.4 mm in Vision 2, and\n0.5 mm in Vision 3.

Changes to the shape of the dose response\nrelationship had a large impact on the results. A log linear model\nwithout a transformation of the exposure found gains that were in\nsome cases more than double that of a power 0.5 relationship.\nSmaller effects were found (in order) from a log transformation of\nthe exposure, a power 0.375 transformation, and power 0.25\ntransformation (see Table 12).\nWhen relative risks were used for the effect of physical activity\ndirectly on all-cause mortality a larger impact was found on years\nof life lost than from combining changes from individual diseases,\nsee Table 13. The reduction in all-cause mortality were similar\nusing the relative risk for walking (applied to changes in active\ntravel) and the relative risk for total physical activity (applied to\nchanges in total activity).\nResults from the models using the HEAT tools’ relative risks\ngenerally produced larger health impacts than using ITHIM\nrelative risks. This was the case even when applying non-\ntransformed dose response curves in ITHIM, indicating that both\nthe relative risk point estimate and the shape of the exposure\nresponse curve within HEAT contribute to the larger result.\nUsing HEAT directly produced an even larger result in terms of\nproportion of deaths for given age groups than that from using the\nHEAT relative risks within ITHIM (see Table 13). However,\napplying the HEAT guidance by excluding the impact of physical\nactivity on mortality amongst older adults considerably reduced\nthe proportion of premature deaths averted in the whole\npopulation, because of the high number of deaths in older people.\nAt an older age a death contributes less to years of life lost so the\ndifference in years of life lost was smaller than the difference in\ndeaths. Because HEAT recommends a lower age threshold for\ncycling than for walking the difference in results are greater for\ncycling than for walking.\nTo summarise the comparison, if using both tools with the\nrecommended values (and combining results from changes to\ncycling and walking in HEAT) there were higher numbers of\npremature deaths averted with HEAT than with ITHIM if\nsumming individual diseases in ITHIM but typically a smaller\nnumber of deaths averted with HEAT than with ITHIM if directly\nmodelling all-cause mortality with ITHIM. However, due to the\nexclusion of impacts on older age groups with HEAT the\npremature deaths averted would be at an older average age in\nITHIM compared with HEAT, and hence would tend to\ncorrespond to fewer years of life lost.\nIf it was assumed that age and sex relative times spent walking\nand cycling remained unchanged at baseline levels in all scenarios\nthen the absolute health benefit was notably smaller for all the\nVisions (DALYs: Vision 1, 1.1% vs 1.8%; Vision 2, 2.2% vs 2.9%;\nVision 3, 3.3% vs 4.1%).\nInjury. The sensitivity analysis assuming a power 0.5 found\nsmaller benefits for Visions 1 and 2 but the injury disease burden\nstill fell under all scenarios (DALYs: Vision 1,213%; Vision 2,\n256%; Vision 3,259%). If a fully linear model was used then the\ninjury disease burden increased under all scenarios, with a large\nincrease in Vision 3 (DALYs: Vision 1, 22%; Vision 2, 4%; Vision\n3, 168%).\nWhen the effect of changes in speed was excluded from the\nmode, the injury burden still fell in all scenarios but by smaller\namounts (DALYs: Vision 1; 24%, Vision 2; 251%, Vision 3;\n245%).\nAir pollution. Using the proportion of total emissions PM 2.5\nattributable to road transport (20.7%) gave a considerably greater\nreduction in concentrations and in disease burden for all scenarios.\nAverage exposure was reduced by 0.4mm in Vision 1, 1.2mmi n\nVision 2, and 1.4 mm in Vision 3, with a reduction in disease\nburden (DALYs per million population) in Vision 1 of 148\nDALYs, Vision 2 of 429 DALYs, and Vision 3 of 520 DALYs.\nHowever, these reductions are still smaller than those from\nchanges in injury and much smaller than those from changes in\nphysical activity.\nCarbon dioxide.

Sensitivity analyses highlight\nthe importance of increasing walking and cycling amongst older\nage groups.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nThis study is the first study to model scenarios for England and\nWales outside of London. A previous health service economic\nmodelling study took results from London and extrapolated these\nto the rest of the England and Wales but did not model detailed\nnew scenarios for England and Wales [36]. There are a number of\nstrengths to the current study. It is based on the use of a health\nimpact modelling tool, combining transport analysis with health,\ninjury risk and pollution analyses. The study drew on large\ndatasets covering multiple years to provide information on travel\npatterns by age and gender and on non-travel physical activity. A\nfurther strength is the use of a more sophisticated physical activity\nand road traffic injury model than that used in earlier studies,\nincluding integration of the impacts of speed on road traffic\ninjuries. The multiple sensitivity analyses and comparisons with\nthe main other modelling tools, the HEAT tools, provide\ninformation on the extent to which different parameters and\nmodelling assumptions lead to different results.\nThe study also has a number of limitations. The use of a simple\nair pollution model only considering the effects of PM 2.5 and not\nincluding a dispersion model may mean the benefits from\nreductions in air pollution are underestimated [37]. Alternatively,\nthe results may be overestimated as we did not model potential\neffects of higher ventilation rates of pedestrians and cyclists\ncompared with motor vehicle occupants [38]. Another limitation is\ndue to the comparative risk assessment method used for physical\nactivity and air pollution. This method is only able to estimate\ncommitted gains between two static comparisons and cannot\nreliably estimate changes over time. The change in injuries over\ntime was also not modelled.\nThe household travel surveys and the Health Survey for\nEngland suffer from the limitations of self-reported data. In the\ntravel surveys shorter walking trips in particular may be\nunderreported. Reporting accuracy over the week is likely to fall\noff. Walking and cycling away from public roads is inadequately\ncaptured in the surveys. Stats19 is police reported data, although it\nis likely to be accurate for fatalities, it will miss some serious\ninjuries, and many minor injuries [27]. For this reason we did not\nmodel changes to minor injuries. Injuries not involving a motor\nvehicle are particularly likely to be underreported for cycling and\nfalls or other injuries sustained while walking, that do not result\nfrom an impact with a motor vehicle, are not recorded.\nWhen modelling physical activity and air pollution, no lagged\nimpact on older age groups was modelled; that is, a change in\nexposure amongst one age group was assumed to lead to changes\nin health outcomes for that age group alone. Support for most of\nthe impact from changing behaviour occurring in less than 10\nyears is provided by Byberg et al 2009 [39]. The physical activity\nmodel uses relative risks based on physical activity from multiple\ndomains for most diseases, but on walking alone for diabetes and\ncardiovascular disease. If non-transport physical activity is similar\nbetween the populations in which the walking studies were\nconducted and the population to which the modelling results are\napplied, then the use of walking specific relative risks would be\nappropriate. The similarity of the impact on all-cause mortality\nusing either the walking relative risks combined with active travel\nphysical activity alone or with the results using all activity relative\nrisks combined with total physical activity encourages confidence\nin the use of these estimates. Only some health impacts were\nincluded in the model. This study did not model an effect on\noverweight and obesity so the total benefits may be greater than\nwe currently identified. Other health pathways, such as noise\npollution were also not included.\nComparison against other studies and models\nEarlier studies for London [2], the Netherlands [40], Barcelona\n[41], New Zealand [42], Copenhagen [43]m and California [6]\nhave found increases in road traffic injuries with climate change\nmitigation active travel scenarios. It is therefore encouraging that\nwe found a reduction in road traffic injuries in a high income\ncountry. The finding of a reduction in injury risk may appear\ncounterintuitive. This finding is likely to be related to the following\nfactors:\n1) The inclusion of changes to travel by ‘striking vehicle’ in\naddition to the mode of the injured person combined with\nthe very large reductions in motor vehicle distance in Visions\n2 and 3.\n2) The inclusion of non-linearity of risk with distance factors.\n3) The reductions in total travel distances in the more active\nscenario.\n4) The inclusion of a speed model.\n5) The inclusion of changes to freight in the scenarios.\nThe main findings of reduction in disease burden for ischemic\nheart disease (10.8% Vision 2 and 15.6% Vision 3) were smaller\nthan under the main scenarios for London in previous work, which\nfound a 18% reduction using a model based on an untransformed\nphysical activity exposure with a threshold [2]. The average\namount of walking and cycling in the previous study’s scenarios\nTable 14.Megatonnes of CO2 from people living in urban areas by Vision1.\nVision 0 Vision 1 Vision 2 Vision 3\nPassenger cars, taxis, motorbikes & mopeds 57.6 39.6 5.6 4.4\nBuses 2.7 5.2 10.6 5.6\nTotal 60.3 44.7 16.2 10.1\n1. Additional reductions in emissions due to changes in freight were not modelled, nor were increases in emissions due to rail.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051462.t014\nHealth Impacts of Active Travel in England & Wales\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e51462\n(cycling 3.4 km, walking 1.6 km per person per day) were lower\nthan those in Vision 3 but higher than those in Vision 2 (see\nTable 3).\nThe HEAT tools are the most widely used model for estimating\nchanges in health outcomes following a change in walking and\ncycling. Some studies have used the HEAT tools directly [37,44],\nwhile other tools have taken various parameters from the HEAT\ntools and used them as part of other models [3,40,41]. It is also\nused as part of the UK Department for Transport WebTAG\nguidance [45]. The HEAT tool estimates social benefits by\napplying a monetised value of a statistical life to the number of\npremature deaths averted. These tools are simple to use and the\nmethods are transparent. The relative risks for these models and\nthe recommended shape of the dose response relationship\nproduced considerably larger results than those recommended\nwith ITHIM, although the overall impact was offset by the\nexclusion of effects on older age groups. In HEAT the relative risks\nfor cycling are taken from one study of cycling from Denmark\n[23]. Because of the small number of cohort studies investigating\nthe effect of cycling on mortality a meta-analysis of cycling studies\nwould not be satisfactory. However, it should be noted that while\none other study found a similar large result (albeit with wide\nconfidence intervals) [46] a third study showed no evidence of an\neffect [47]. Given the limitations of cycling specific evidence and\nwithout a strong rationale that cycling provides additional benefits\nbeyond those expected from its MET intensity it would seem\nreasonable to use a relative risk from other activities of similar\nintensity.\nIf the relationship between physical activity and health\noutcomes is strongly curvilinear, as suggested by reviews\n[20,21,48], then one would expect a smaller effect from a measure\nof any one type of activity alone, such as cycling, than from a\nmeasure of all activities combined. In this case, if a relative risk\nbased on multiple domains of physical activity is used, it is\nimportant to estimate the levels of non-cycling activity amongst the\npopulation. If a relative risk for walking or cycling specifically is\nused then it is not necessary to estimate other physical activity\ngiven the following two conditions: non-transport physical activity\nis similar at baseline in the target population to that of the\npopulations in the studies from which the relative risks were\nderived; and non-transport activity does not change with a change\nin active travel.\nThe evidence for walking is considerably greater than that for\ncycling. The HEAT tool bases its relative risk on a meta-analysis\nthat has not yet been fully published [49]. The results from those\nmeta-analyses for which more detail is available suggest a smaller\nresult [20,21]. Despite this it should be noted that systematic\nreviews identify considerable heterogeneity and the confidence\nintervals only represent some of the uncertainty [15,50,51]. It\nshould also be noted that most of the large studies of self-reported\nphysical activity and health outcomes only measured exposure at\none point in time and misclassification of exposure over time\nwould lead to underestimation of the results. This would suggest\nthat the relative risks used by ITHIM could be underestimates.\nIn our scenarios the exclusion of health benefits amongst older\npeople by HEAT leads to a very large reduction in the size of the\nexpected benefits. In some settings, achieving increases in cycling\namongst older people may not be seen as feasible in the short term\nand the exclusion may be appropriate. However, the evidence\nfrom the Netherlands indicates that cycling amongst older people\nis a realistic goal. Relative risks for older age groups may be\nexpected to differ from those for younger groups; however, the\nexisting evidence suggests a larger benefit from low amounts of\nactivity than is the case amongst younger people [20]. Explicit\nspecification of who is changing behaviour in health impact\nmodelling broken down by age offers advantages over more\naggregate modelling approaches where older age groups are\nexcluded.\nPolicy implications\nWalking and cycling can be important, everyday, modes of\ntransport if our cities are designed for them. Lower average travel\nspeeds, with a prioritisation of local accessibility over longer\ndistance mobility increase the attractiveness of walking and\ncycling. These changes would have positive implications for\ninjuries and emissions, with significant health benefits, principally\nfrom increased physical activity, that are currently not accounted\nfor when investments in transport (and in cities more generally) are\nevaluated.\nThis study is based on scenarios in which there is a step-change\nin active travel. In the Visions 2030 study Visions 2 and 3 are\nassumed to occur in the context of substantive social and economic\nchanges. The addition of health impact modelling results\ncontributes to the discussion on what is involved in pedestrian\nand cyclist friendly futures. This approach suggests an alternative\nway of thinking about policies, both foregrounding the kind of\nsocial and economic changes which could make stronger, more\neffective policies possible and considering how policies might\npromote resilience in the context of such changes (e.g. large\nreductions in energy availability). The medical and public health\ncommunities have a responsibility to highlight the importance of\nhealth when considering alternative futures and should influence\nplanners to move away from a car-dependent society.\nEncouragingly we found a reduction in injuries, although under\ncertain assumptions injuries increased and given the uncertainty\nabout the mechanisms explaining non-linearity of risk [52] it is\nimportant that policies focus on reducing risk whilst increasing\nwalking and cycling.\nSensitivity analysis highlights the importance of changes to who\nis walking and cycling. In the Netherlands, cycling is not only\nmuch more common than in England and Wales but it is relatively\nmuch more widespread at older ages. If cycling increased in\nEngland and Wales but did not become relatively more common\namongst older people then the analysis indicates that the\nanticipated health impact would be smaller.\nDecisions on investments in transport are often dominated by\ntravel time savings [53]. Travel time savings are mainly achieved\nby increasing the speed of motorised transport. There is a good\ncase for prioritising the health benefits from investments in\ntransport over travel time savings benefits. Although considerable\nuncertainty remains around quantification of these health benefits\nthey may still represent more tangible benefits than those from\ntime savings, which will usually be taken first as improved\naccessibility for those using cars and then over time become\nchanges in land use, with increased urban sprawl and the\nexpectation of and requirement for longer travel distances woven\ninto the urban fabric [53].\nCurrent appraisal methods would typically try to compare\nhealth impacts, CO\n2 emissions, and time savings within a common\nmonetised metric (e.g. [3]); however, it can be argued that such a\nmeasure does little to provide useful information for social decision\nmaking (e.g. [54]) Given the strong arguments that large emission\nreductions are necessary to reduce the risk of climate destabilisa-\ntion, it might be more appropriate to evaluate how effective\noptions are at achieving these reductions and the extent of any co-\nbenefits or harms, rather than monetising reductions in CO2\nemissions [55]. Beyond this, a case can be made for starting from\nnormative goals of what healthy and low carbon transport systems\nHealth Impacts of Active Travel in England & Wales\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 15 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e51462\nshould be like and then working backwards around the question of\nhow to get there.\nUnanswered questions and future research\nDifferent relative risk functions and modelling approaches\nproduce very different results. Summing results from individual\ndiseases produced considerably smaller results than those observed\nwhen directly estimating effects on all-cause mortality. Although\nphysical activity may affect diseases not included in the model this\nis unlikely to explain the size of the difference. Future modelling\nand empirical research should investigate these differences and\nattempt to reduce uncertainty in this area.\nThe extent to which increases in walking and cycling would\naffect weight gain and obesity is uncertain but such mechanisms\ncould represent an important health dimension that is not included\nin this model. Relatives risks were chosen, if possible, that adjusted\nfor obesity, and thus health gains from reductions in obesity could\nbe in addition to those reported in this paper.\nFuture modelling work should consider how we might achieve\nstep-changes in active travel. There is an argument for going\nbeyond focusing on marginal policy changes to investigation of the\npotential tipping points in transport systems that might lead to\nsubstantively different futures.\nConclusion\nMoving urban trips from car travel to walking and cycling can\nprovide substantive benefits to population health and reduce\ntransport related greenhouse gas emissions. The largest benefits\nare likely to be from changes to physical activity. The study\nsuggests that total injuries need not go up with increased walking\nand cycling as long as there are sufficient reductions in motor\nvehicle distance and lower motor vehicle speeds. Policies to\nachieve a step-change in active travel and reduce use of motor\nvehicles should be supported.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Schematic of physical activity model.
