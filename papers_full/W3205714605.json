  "abstract": "This article examines the types of faults observed in the windings of traction transformers used in the railway system and the factors that cause them. A visual inspection of traction transformers used in the railway system was conducted. The results of experimental testing of operating oils in traction transformers are presented. It was determined that the main cause of the observed faults in the traction transformers was the transformer oil.",
