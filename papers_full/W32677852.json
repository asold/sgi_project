    "abstract": "This study outlines crucial differences between long- and short-acting contraceptive users. Further family planning policy efforts taking into account regional, religious and other personal and socio-economic factors would effectively augment ongoing efforts. Additionally, the role played by discussion with health professionals in supporting long-term contraceptive use reflects the success of the ongoing effort to drive use in Ethiopia. KEY MESSAGE Global and national health actors are focused on improving access to long-acting contraceptives, however there is little evidence on factors that facilitate their uptake compared to the traditionally popular, short-acting contraceptives. Our study found significant religious and regional differences in long-acting contraceptive use which policy makers can use to guide their efforts.. Community health extension workers play a key role in long-term contraceptive access through tailored person-person education, consultation, and provision.",
