    "abstract": "Analysis of pedestrians’ motion is important to real-world applications in public scenes. Due to the complex temporal and spatial factors, trajectory prediction is a challenging task. With the development of attention mechanism recently, transformer network has been successfully applied in natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. We propose an end-to-end transformer network embedded with random deviation queries for pedestrian trajectory forecasting. The self-correcting scheme can enhance the robustness of the network. Moreover, we present a co-training strategy to improve the training effect. The whole scheme is trained collaboratively by the original loss and classification loss. Therefore, we also achieve more accurate prediction results. Experimental results on several datasets indicate the validity and robustness of the network. We achieve the best performance in individual forecasting and comparable results in social forecasting. Encouragingly, our approach achieves a new state of the art on the Hotel and Zara2 datasets compared with the social-based and individual-based approaches.",
