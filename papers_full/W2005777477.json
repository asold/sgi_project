Such transformers are usually\nconnected in parallel to supply the distribution loads.\nProduction of high inrush current in a big transformer during switching\nin the supply always creates a big power quality problem. The transient\nvoltage dip may cause motor tripping, mal-function to electronic loads and\nprotective relays etc. Energization of the transformer from the star side\nallows the control of neutral resistor utilizing the advantage of unbalancing\nin the 3-phase inrush current and sequential switching of phases to achieve the\nreduction of inrush current [1, 2]. Sequential switching with optimum value\nof neutral resistor may reduce the inrush current to a lower value, but the\nsystem experiences the inrush during the energization of each transformer.\nThis paper suggests that the delta secondary of all the transformers\nshould be connected in parallel before applying sequential energization of\nthe ﬁrst transformer. This procedure eliminates inrush currents completely\nfor subsequent switching in of the remaining transformers without any sub-\nstantial increase of inrush in the ﬁrst transformer.\n2 Sequential phase energization\nFig. 1. Two transformers connected in parallel\nIn Fig. 1 two star-delta transformers are connected in parallel to supply\nthe distribution loads. During normal operation star neutrals are solidly\nconnected to ground. The conventional way of energizing each transformer\nis to switch on the supply to the star-side by closing the respective circuit\nbreakers (CB) one by one, thereby, creating very high inrush current as high\nas 10 to 12 times the full load current each time. Then the delta-side CBs\nare closed. The peak value of the inrush current depends on the instant of\nswitching, winding resistance and residual ﬂux in the core.

Energize any one phase (say phase-a)\n2. After a short delay (about 5 cycles) when current in phase-a stabilizes,\nphase-b is closed.\n3. After another short delay of about 5 cycles when currents in both a\nand b phases are stabilized, phase-c is closed.\n4. Finally the neutral resistor Rn is shorted by closing the switch S.\nIt is well known that modern high voltage circuit breakers have a built-in\nmechanical delay among three phases or independent operating mechanism\nfor each phase. So the implementation of the scheme is not diﬃcult.\nThe equivalent circuit of any one transformer having delta secondary and\nonly phase-a energized is shown in Fig. 2.\nI\na = E sin(ωt + δ − φ)\n√\nRn2 +( 2Xo/3)2 − E sin(δ − φ)\n√\nRn2 +( 2Xo/3)2 e−Rnt/(2Lo/3) (1)\nEa = E sin(ωt + δ); Lo = Xo/ω; φ =t a n−1(2Xo/3Rn);\nWhere, Ia,E a – Current, supply voltage in phase-a; Xo, Lo – positive\nsequence open circuit reactance, inductance per phase; Ra = winding resis-\ntance per phase; Ra ≪ Rn; Total resistance = Rn +Ra ≈ Rn. Component\nof the current due to no-load loss is neglected.\nFig. 2. Equivalent circuit (ph-a energized)\nThe dc decaying component E sin(δ − φ)\n√\nRn2 +( 2Xo/3)2 e−Rnt/(2Lo/3) of the cur-\nrent at the instant of switching may saturate the transformer and Lo becomes\nvery low.\nLo (saturated)≪ Rn. Thus the peak inrush current mainly depends upon\nRn.\nc⃝ IEICE 2007\nDOI: 10.1587/elex.4.147\nReceived November 22, 2006\nAccepted January 09, 2007\nPublished March 10, 2007\n149\n\nIEICE Electronics Express, Vol.4, No.5, 147–152\nHigh value of Rn produces low inrush current and the steady state current\nis reached within a very short time as the time constant (2Lo/3Rn) is low.\nAt the instants of switching in phase-b and phase-c the magnitude of\ncontact voltage diﬀerences ∆Vb and ∆Vc across the CB contacts should be\nlow to produce low value of inrush currents. In reference [2] it has been\nshown that Rn ≈ 0.085 Xo produces minimum steady state magnitude of\n∆V\nb=∆Vc ≈ 0.68E. So, this value of Rn may be chosen for sequential phase\nenergization. When all the three phases are energized the neutral current\nbecomes very low and shorting of Rn may not produce any transient current.\nEnergization of each transformer by sequential switching is not only a\ncomplex procedure but also produces some inrush current in each case.\nThe disadvantages of the conventional sequential switching scheme are:\na) The complex procedure of sequential switching is to be followed for\neach transformer at the time of energization of each of them.\nb) Some inrush current is produced at the time of energization of each\ntransformer.\nc ) N e u t r a lr e s i s t o ri st ob eu s e dw i t he a c ht r a n s f o r m e ra n di st ob es h o r t e d\nat the end of sequential switching of each of them.\n3 Proposed scheme\nBefore energizing any transformer all the delta secondary are connected in\nparallel. CB3 and CB4 (refer Fig. 1) are closed ﬁrst and the neutral of TR2\nis solidly grounded and Rn2 becomes redundant. The sequential switching\noperation is now carried out on TR1. If 2 transformers having the same\nrating are connected in parallel, then the equivalent open circuit reactance\nbecomes Xo/2. Therefore, the optimum value of Rn should be half of the\nprevious value. So the inrush current in all the phases of TR1 increases to\nsome extent during sequential switching in comparison to those values for\nenergizing TR1 with isolated secondary. The delta winding voltages of TR1\nand TR2 are equal as they are connected in parallel and are proportional\nto supply voltage after Rn is shorted. So, the induced star-side voltage of\nTR2 becomes equal to the supply voltage. Subsequent closing of CB2 does\nnot produce any inrush current in TR2. Similarly, if all the delta secondary\nof more than 2 transformers are connected in parallel, sequential switching\nproduces some inrush current in TR1 only. The inrush current is completely\neliminated during closing of star-side CBs of the remaining transformers.\nThe advantages of the proposed scheme are:\na) The sequential switching is to be carried out only on the ﬁrst trans-\nformer to be energized and some inrush current is produced only once.\nb) The remaining transformers are directly switched on without producing\nany inrush current.\nc⃝ IEICE 2007\nDOI: 10.1587/elex.4.147\nReceived November 22, 2006\nAccepted January 09, 2007\nPublished March 10, 2007\n150\n\nIEICE Electronics Express, Vol.4, No.5, 147–152\nc) The neutral resistor is to be used only with the ﬁrst transformer and\nall other transformers are solidly grounded.\n4 Simulation results\nTwo star-delta transformers having a rating of 12 kVA, 400 V/115 V, 50 Hz\neach is used for simulation study to verify the validity of the proposed scheme.\nThe winding resistance and no-load reactance of each transformer are 0.37\nand 422 ohm per phase respectively. Magnetization curve with deep satu-\nration data of a silicon-steel core is used for the simulation. A MATLAB\nprogram is prepared for the simulation study. Neutral resistor of 36 ohm\n(≈ 0.085x422) is used for sequential phase energization of one transformer\nwith isolated secondary and 18 ohm is used with two secondary in parallel.\nTime delay of 0.1 second (5 cycles in 50 Hz system) is used between consecu-\ntive switching operations.\nSimulation results are shown in Fig. 3 (a), (b) and (c).\nFig. 3 (a) Inrush current [Rn = 36 ohm]\nFig. 3 (b) Inrush Current [Rn = 18 ohm]\nc⃝ IEICE 2007\nDOI: 10.1587/elex.4.147\nReceived November 22, 2006\nAccepted January 09, 2007\nPublished March 10, 2007\n151\n\nIEICE Electronics Express, Vol.4, No.5, 147–152\nFig. 3 (c) Voltage diﬀerence\nThe peak inrush is about 50% of full-load current (17.32 A) while ener-\ngizing one transformer with isolated secondary and approximately 72% with\ndelta windings in parallel. Simultaneous closing of all the phases without any\nneutral resistor produces inrush 3.3 times the full-load current. The voltage\ndiﬀerence between the source voltages of each phase with the star-side in-\nduced voltages for parallel delta energization is about 0.15% of the source\nvoltage (230√2 V peak per phase). It justiﬁes the validity of the proposed\nscheme as no inrush current will be produced while closing CB2 with so small\nvolt diﬀerence. Simulation results of star-delta transformers each having a\nrating of 50 MVA, 132 kV/33 kV, 50 Hz also validate the proposed scheme.\n5 Conclusion\nHuge magnetizing inrush currents are produced during energization of large\ntransformers creating voltage sag to cause mal-function to electronic and\nother loads. Sequential phase energization in star-delta transformer with op-\ntimum value of neutral resistor may reduce the inrush current substantially.\nHowever, some inrush current is always produced while energizing each trans-\nformer in a group of transformers. Application of sequential switching to only\none transformer after connecting all delta-secondary in parallel may eliminate\ninrush current during subsequent energization of the remaining transformers\nwithout any substantial increase in inrush of the ﬁrst transformer. This tech-\nnique also restricts the application of complex process of sequential switching\nand the use of neutral resistor to one transformer only.\nc⃝ IEICE 2007\nDOI: 10.1587/elex.4.147\nReceived November 22, 2006\nAccepted January 09, 2007\nPublished March 10, 2007\n152\n",
