Bot operators often launch bot\ncampaigns to pursue malicious goals, which harms the in-\ntegrity of the online discourse. Over the past decade, Twit-\nter bots were actively involved in election interference (Deb\net al. 2019; Ferrara 2017), spreading misinformation (Cresci\n2020) and promoting extreme ideology (Berger and Mor-\ngan 2015). Since malicious Twitter bots pose threat to online\ncommunities and induce undesirable social effects, effective\nTwitter bot detection measures are desperately needed.\nEarlier works in Twitter bot detection generally rely on\nfeature engineering, where an ample amount of user fea-\ntures are proposed and evaluated. Features extracted from\ntweets (Cresci et al. 2016) and user metadata (Yang et al.\n2020; Lee and Kim 2013; Miller et al. 2014) were com-\nbined with traditional classifiers for bot detection. With the\nadvent of deep learning, neural network based Twitter bot\ndetectors were increasingly prevalent. Recurrent neural net-\nworks are adopted to encode tweets and detect bots based\nCopyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

Self-supervised learning techniques\nwere introduced to counter bot evolution (Feng et al. 2021b).\nGraph neural networks (Ali Alhosseini et al. 2019; Feng\net al. 2021d) were later used to leverage the graph struc-\nture of the Twittersphere, while state-of-the-art methods are\ntopology-aware in one way or another.\nDespite earlier successes of leveraging the topological\nstructure of the Twittersphere, these methods fail to recog-\nnize the intrinsic heterogeneity of Twitter and leverage it to\nidentify subtle differences between genuine users and novel\nTwitter bots. Figure 1 illustrates two levels of heterogeneity\nthat are pervasive on the real-world Twittersphere:\n• Relation Heterogeneity. Twitter users are connected\nwith different types of relations. For example, one user\nmight like, comment, retweet or block another user,\nwhile these activities signal different relations between\nthem.\n• Influence Heterogeneity.Twitter users have different in-\nfluence range and intensity over their neighbors on the\nTwittersphere. For example, distinguished news outlets\nmight have a tremendous impact on the minds of many,\nwhile ordinary users generally inform close circles of\ntheir recent activities.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Twitter bot detection\nframework that leverages the topological structure of the\nreal-world Twittersphere, and on top of that, models per-\nvasive heterogeneity of relation and influence to boost task\nperformance. Specifically, we construct heterogeneous in-\nformation networks with users as nodes and diversified rela-\nThe Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-22)\n3977\nFigure 2: Overview of our graph-based and heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detection framework.\ntions as edges. We then propose relational graph transform-\ners to model influence intensity with the attention mech-\nanism and learn node representations. Finally, we adopt\nsemantic attention networks to aggregate messages across\nusers and relations and conduct bot detection. Our main con-\ntributions are summarized as follows:\n• We propose to leverage relation and influence hetero-\ngeneity of the real-world Twittersphere, which enables\nour bot detection model to identify subtle differences be-\ntween genuine users and bots and conduct robust bot de-\ntection.\n• We propose a novel Twitter bot detection framework that\nis graph-based and heterogeneity-aware. It is an end-to-\nend bot detector that adopts relational graph transformers\nto leverage the topology and heterogeneity of the real-\nworld Twittersphere.\n• We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our model\nand state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive bot de-\ntection benchmark. Results demonstrate that our pro-\nposal consistently outperform all baseline methods. Fur-\nther experiments also bear out the effectiveness of our\ngraph-based and heterogeneity-aware approach.\nRelated Work\nTwitter Bot Detection\nEarly Twitter bot detection models focus on manually de-\nsigned features and combine them with traditional classi-\nfiers. These features are extracted from tweets (Cresci et al.\n2016), user metadata (Yang et al. 2020; Lee and Kim 2013)\nor both (Miller et al. 2014). As deep learning later shows\ngreat promise and gains popularity, an increasing amount\nof neural network based bot detectors are proposed. Fully\nconnected networks (Kudugunta and Ferrara 2018), recur-\nrent neural networks (Wei and Nguyen 2019) and gener-\native adversarial networks (Stanton and Irissappane 2019)\nare adopted in effective bot detection models to leverage\ndifferent aspects of user information. SATAR (Feng et al.\n2021b), a recently proposed framework, jointly leverages\nmulti-modal user information with different deep architec-\ntures to improve upon these methods.\nAlthough SATAR (Feng et al. 2021b) proposes to leverage\nthe graph structure of the Twittersphere for bot detection, it\ndoes so in a feature engineering manner, rather than adopting\nstate-of-the-art graph neural network architectures. Graph-\nbased bot detectors were proposed to fill in the blanks.\n(Ali Alhosseini et al. 2019) views Twitter as a network of\nusers and adopt graph convolutional networks to conduct bot\ndetection. (Feng et al. 2021d) further constructs a hetero-\ngeneous information network to represent Twitter and uses\nrelational GNNs for bot detection, which achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance. However, these graph-based methods\nfail to incorporate the intrinsic heterogeneity of relation and\ninfluence on the real-world Twittersphere. In this paper, we\nbuild on these works and propose a heterogeneity-aware bot\ndetector, which dynamically incorporates and leverages di-\nversified relations and influence patterns between users.\nHeterogeneous Information Networks\nReal-world network data often consist of large quantities of\ndiversified and interactive entities, which can be called het-\nerogeneous information networks (HINs). HINs are widely\nadopted to model social networks (Wasserman and Faust\n1994; Otte and Rousseau 2002; Nguyen et al. 2020), link\nand graph mining (Getoor and Diehl 2005; Cook and Holder\n2000) and natural language processing systems (De Cao,\nAziz, and Titov 2018; Feng et al. 2021a). To effectively\nanalyze HINs, (Schlichtkrull et al. 2018) proposes rela-\ntional graph convolutional networks to extend GCN (Kipf\nand Welling 2016) to heterogeneous graphs. (Wang et al.\n2019) proposes heterogeneous graph attention networks to\nextend GAT to heterogeneous graphs. In this paper, we build\n3978\non these works to propose relational graph transformers and\nleverage Twitter heterogeneity.\nMethodology\nOverview\nFigure 2 presents an overview of our proposed graph-based\nand heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detector. Specifically,\nwe firstly construct a heterogeneous information network\nwith diversified relations to represent the Twittersphere. We\nthen learn node representations under each relation with our\nproposed relational graph transformers. After that, we take a\nglobal view of the graph and dynamically aggregates repre-\nsentations across relations with semantic attention networks.\nFinally, we classify Twitter users into bots or genuine users\nand learn model parameters.\nGraph Construction\nWe construct a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to\nrepresent the Twittersphere, which takes the relation hetero-\ngeneity into account and leverages diversified interactions\nbetween users. Specifically, we take Twitter users as nodes\nin the graph and we connect them with different types of\nedges, representing diversified relations on Twitter. We de-\nnote the set of relations in the HIN asR while our framework\nsupports any relation settings.\nSince this paper focuses on leveraging relation and influ-\nence heterogeneity to improve bot detection, we follow the\nsame user information encoding procedure in the state-of-\nthe-art approach (Feng et al. 2021d) for fairness. We denote\nuser i’s feature vector as xi and transform it with a fully\nconnected layer to serve as initial features in the GNNs, i.e.,\nx(0)\ni = σ(WI ·xi + bI) (1)\nwhere WI and bI are learnable parameters, σ denotes non-\nlinearity and we use leaky-relu as σ without further notice.\nRelational Graph Transformers\nInspired by Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its suc-\ncess in natural language processing, we propose relational\ngraph transformers, a GNN architecture that incorporates\ntransformers and operates on HINs. We firstly obtain query,\nkey and value for the c-th attention head with regard to rela-\ntion r and node i, formulated as\nqr\nc,i\n(l) = Wr\nc,q\n(l) ·x(l−1)\ni + br\nc,q\n(l),\nkr\nc,j\n(l) = Wr\nc,k\n(l) ·x(l−1)\nj + br\nc,k\n(l),\nvr\nc,j\n(l) = Wr\nc,v\n(l) ·x(l−1)\nj + br\nc,v\n(l),\n(2)\nwhere q, k and v are query, key and value of the attention\nmechanism, (l) denotes the l-th layer of GNNs, all W and\nb are learnable parameters with regard to different relations\nand attention heads. We then model influence heterogeneity\nby calculating attention weights between different nodes by\nαr\nc,ij\n(l) = ⟨qr\nc,i\n(l), kr\nc,j\n(l)⟩\nP\nu∈Nr(i)⟨qr\nc,i\n(l), krc,u\n(l)⟩\n, (3)\nwhere αr\nc,ij\n(l) denotes the attention weight between nodes\ni and j, ⟨q, k⟩ = exp(qT k√\nd ) is the exponential scale dot-\nproduct function where d is the hidden size of each attention\nhead, Nr(i) denotes node i’s neighborhood with regard to\nrelation r. We then aggregate over node neighborhood and\nattention heads to obtain node representation under relation\nr, i.e.,\nur\ni\n(l) = 1\nC\nCX\nc=1\n\n X\nj∈Nr(i)\nαr\nc,ij\n(l) ·vr\nc,j\n(l)\n\n, (4)\nwhere ur\ni\n(l) is the hidden representations of node i in l-th\nlayer for relation r, C is the number of attention heads. We\nthen apply the gate mechanism to obtained results to ensure\nsmooth representation learning. We firstly obtain the gate\nlevel as follows\nzr\ni\n(l) = sigmoid(W r\nA ·[ur\ni\n(l), x(l)\ni ] +br\nA), (5)\nwhere [·, ·] is the concatenation operation, WA and bA are\nlearnable parameters. We then apply the gate mechanism to\nlearned representation ur\ni\n(l) and input xr\ni\n(l) by\nhr\ni\n(l) = tanh(ur\ni\n(l)) ⊙zr\ni\n(l) + xr\ni\n(l) ⊙(1 −zr\ni\n(l)), (6)\nwhere ⊙denotes the Hadamard product operation and hr\ni\n(l)\nis the learned representation of nodei with regard to relation\nr in the l-th layer.\nSemantic Attention Networks\nAfter analyzing the HIN while separating different relations,\nwe use semantic attention networks to aggregate node repre-\nsentations across relations while preserving the relation het-\nerogeneity entailed in the Twitter HIN. Firstly, we obtain the\nimportance of each relation by taking a global view of all\nnodes in the HIN, i.e.,\nwr\nd\n(l) = 1\n|V |\nX\ni∈V\nq(l)\nd\nT\n·tanh(Wd,s\n(l) ·hr\ni\n(l) + bd,s\n(l)), (7)\nwhere wr\nd\n(l) denotes the weight of relation r at the d-th at-\ntention head, V denotes the set of nodes in HIN, q(l)\nd is the\nsemantic attention vector at the d-th attention head in layer\nl, q(l)\nd , W(l)\nd,s and b(l)\nd,s are learnable parameters of the seman-\ntic attention network. We normalize the importance of each\nrelation with softmax, formulated by\nβr\nd\n(l) = exp(wr\nd\n(l))\nP\nk∈R exp(wk\nd\n(l)\n)\n, (8)\nwhere βr\nd\n(l) denotes the weight of relation r. We then fuse\nnode representations under different relations with these\nweights as follows\nx(l)\ni = 1\nD\nDX\nd=1\n\"X\nr∈R\nβr\nd\n(l) ·hr\ni\n(l)\n#\n, (9)\nwhere x(l)\ni denotes the output of layer l, hr\ni\n(l) denotes the\nresults of relational graph transformers and D is the number\nof attention heads in the semantic attention network.\n3979\nAlgorithm 1: Model Learning Algorithm\ninput : Twitter bot detection dataset T\noutput: Optimized model parameters θ\n1 initialize θ;\n2 construct Twitter HIN to obtain relations R;\n3 encode user information to obtain xi;\n4 x(0)\ni ←Equation (1);\n5 while θ has not converged do\n6 for r ∈R do\n7 for each user i ∈T do\n8 find relation-based neighborhood Nr(i);\n9 for c ←1 to C do\n10 for j ∈Nr(i) do\n11 qr\nc,i\n(l), kr\nc,j\n(l), vr\nc,j\n(l) ←Equation (2);\n12 αr\nc,ij\n(l) ←Equation (3);\n13 end\n14 end\n15 hr\ni\n(l) ←Equation (4 - 6);\n16 end\n17 for d ←1 to D do\n18 βr\nd ←Equation (7 - 8);\n19 end\n20 end\n21 x(L)\ni ←Equation (9);\n22 Loss ←Equation (10 - 11);\n23 θ ←BackPropagate (Loss);\n24 end\n25 return θ\nLearning and Optimization\nEach layer of GNN in our model contains a relational graph\ntransformer and a semantic attention network. AfterL layers\nof GNNs, we obtain the final node representations x(L). We\ntransform them with an output layer and a softmax layer for\nTwitter bot detection, i.e.,\nˆyi = softmax(WO ·σ(WL ·x(L)\ni + bL) +bO), (10)\nwhere ˆyi is our model’s prediction of user i, all W and b\nare learnable parameters. We then train our bot detector with\nsupervised annotations and a regularization term, formulated\nas\nLoss = −\nX\ni∈Y\n[yi log( ˆyi) + (1−yi) log(1−ˆyi)]+λ\nX\nw∈θ\nw2,\n(11)\nwhere Y is the annotated user set, yi is the ground-truth\nlabels, θ denotes all trainable parameters in the model and\nλ is a hyperparameter. To sum up, Algorithm 1 presents\nthe overall training schema of our proposed graph-based\nand heterogeneity-aware bot detection framework, with time\ncomplexity of O(|E|) for each layer where E denotes the\nedge set, assuming embedding dimension and the number\nof relations are constants.\nExperiments\nDataset\nOur bot detection model is graph-based and heterogeneity-\naware, which requires data sets that provide certain type of\ngraph structure. TwiBot-20 (Feng et al. 2021c) is a compre-\nhensive Twitter bot detection benchmark and the only pub-\nlicly available bot detection dataset to provide user follow\nrelationships to support graph-based methods. In this paper,\nwe make use of TwiBot-20, which includes 229,573 Twit-\nter users, 33,488,192 tweets, 8,723,736 user property items\nand 455,958 follow relationships. We follow the same splits\nprovided in the benchmark so that results are directly com-\nparable with previous works.\nBaselines\nWe compare our graph-based and heterogeneity-aware ap-\nproach with the following methods:\n• Lee et al.(Lee, Eoff, and Caverlee 2011) extract features\nfrom Twitter user such as the longevity of account and\ncombine them with random forest classifier.\n• Yanget al.(Yang et al. 2020) use random forest classifier\nwith minimal user metadata and derived features.\n• Cresci et al.(Cresci et al. 2016) encode user activity se-\nquences with strings and identify longest common sub-\nstrings to identify bot groups.\n• Kudugunta et al.(Kudugunta and Ferrara 2018) propose\nto jointly leverage user tweet semantics and user meta-\ndata.\n• Wei et al.(Wei and Nguyen 2019) use recurrent neural\nnetworks to encode tweets and classify users based on\ntheir tweets.\n• Miller et al.(Miller et al. 2014) extract 107 features from\nuser tweets and metadata and frames the task of bot de-\ntection as anomaly detection.\n• Botometer (Davis et al. 2016) is a bot detection service\nthat leverages more than 1,000 user features.\n• SATAR (Feng et al. 2021b) is a self-supervised repre-\nsentation learning framework of Twitter users that jointly\nleverages user tweets, metadata and neighborhood infor-\nmation. SATAR conducts bot detection by fine-tuning on\nspecific bot detection data sets.\n• Alhosseini et al.(Ali Alhosseini et al. 2019) use graph\nconvolutional networks to learn user representations and\nconduct bot detection.\n• BotRGCN (Feng et al. 2021d) constructs a heteroge-\nneous graph to represent the Twittersphere and adopts\nrelational graph convolutional networks for representa-\ntion learning and bot detection. BotRGCN achieves state-\nof-the-art performance on the comprehensive TwiBot-20\nbenchmark.\nImplementation\nWe use pytorch (Paszke et al. 2019), pytorch lightning (Fal-\ncon 2019), torch geometric (Fey and Lenssen 2019) and the\ntransformers library (Wolf et al. 2020) for an efficient imple-\nmentation of our proposed Twitter bot detection framework.\n3980\nMethod Deep Interactive Representative Graph-based Heterogeneity-aware Acc.

These results\ndemonstrate the importance of modeling the topological\nstructure of Twitter for bot detection.\n• We propose the first heterogeneity-aware bot detection\nframeworks, which achieves the best performance on a\ncomprehensive benchmark. These results bear out the ne-\ncessity of leveraging Twitter heterogeneity and the effec-\ntiveness of our proposed approach.\nIn the following, we firstly study the role of graphs and\nheterogeneity in our proposed approach. We then examine\nthe data efficiency and representation learning capability of\nour bot detection method.\nGraph Learning Study\nWe propose a graph-based bot detection model, which lever-\nages the topological structure of the Twittersphere to cap-\nture subtle patterns and better identify bots. Specifically, we\nadopt user follower and following relationships as two types\nof edges that connects users as nodes to form a HIN. To\nprove the effectiveness of our proposed graph construction\n3981\nAblation Settings Accuracy F1-score\nfull model 0.8664 0.8821\nremove transformer in RT 0.8521 0.8679\nremove gated residual in RT 0.8478 0.8646\nreplace RT with GAT 0.8571 0.8726\nreplace RT with GCN 0.8444 0.8619\nreplace RT with SAGE 0.8546 0.8687\nsummation as SA 0.8512 0.8654\nmean pooling as SA 0.8512 0.8663\nmax pooling as SA 0.8495 0.8629\nmin pooling as SA 0.8555 0.8704\nTable 3: Ablation study of our proposed GNN architecture.\nRT and SA denote relational transformers and semantic at-\ntention networks respectively.\napproach, we remove different types of edges and report re-\nsults under these ablation settings in Figure 3. It is illustrated\nthat the complete graph structure, with both follower and\nfollowing edges, outperforms any reduced settings. These\nresults prove the effectiveness of our constructed HIN to\nmodel relation heterogeneity on Twitter.\nUpon obtaining a HIN, we propose relational graph trans-\nformers to propagate node messages and learn representa-\ntions. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed GNN archi-\ntecture, we conduct ablation study on relational graph trans-\nformers and report results under different settings in Table\n3. It is demonstrated that transformers, the gate mechanism\nand the semantic attention networks are all essential parts of\nour proposed GNN architecture.\nTo sum up, both our constructed HIN and our proposed\nGNN architecture contribute to our model’s outstanding per-\nformance, which bears out the effectiveness of our graph-\nbased approach.\nHeterogeneity Study\nOur bot detection proposal models the intrinsic heterogene-\nity of Twitter to identify subtle anomalies of bots and con-\nduct robust bot detetcion. We study the effects of incorpo-\nrating heterogeneity and present our findings.\nRelation Heterogeneity Relation heterogeneity refers to\nthe fact that there are diversified relations between users on\nthe real-world Twittersphere. Our bot detection model in-\ncorporates relation heterogeneity by constructing HINs and\nleveraging them with relational GNNs. Different HINs could\nbe constructed with different relation sets R, thus we pro-\npose different relation heterogeneity settings and present\ntheir results in Figure 4. It is illustrated that most heteroge-\nneous relation settings outperform their homogeneous coun-\nterpart, which proves the necessity of modeling relation het-\nerogeneity for Twitter bot detection.\nTo identify relation types that are crucial in Twitter bot\ndetection, we combine all relations to form a comprehensive\ngraph and use weights from the semantic attention networks\nto identify significant relations. Experiment results in Figure\nFigure 4: Performance of our proposed method with differ-\nent relation heterogeneity settings. We cluster users with de-\nscription and bool features, divide users with follower and\nstatus counts, leverage user interest domain in the dataset as\nwell as following information to construct HINs.\nFigure 5: Attention weights of different sets of relations\nthat co-exist on the real-world Twittersphere. We present the\nfirst, second and third quartile of results from multiple runs.\n5 demonstrate that most heterogeneous relations contribute\nequally to our method’s performance, while the user interest\ndomain information in the data set is not as effective.\nTo sum up, we improve bot detection performance by\nincorporating relation heterogeneity and most relations are\nsignificant in our method’s decision making.\nInfluence Heterogeneity Influence heterogeneity refers to\nthe fact that Twitter users have different patterns and inten-\nsity of influence over others on social media. We leverage\ninfluence heterogeneity with the multi-head attention mech-\nanism in relational graph transformers. To validate the ef-\nfectiveness of this approach, we conduct ablation study on\nthe attention mechanism and present results in Figure 6.\nIt is illustrated that incorporating the attention mechanism\n(C > 0, D > 0) outperforms methods without it (C = 0,\nD = 0). Besides, adopting multi-head attention networks\n(C > 1, D > 1) generally outperforms their single-head\ncounterparts (C = 1, D = 1), proving the effectiveness of\nour design choices.\nAfter proving the necessity of leveraging influence het-\nerogeneity, we study a specific cluster of Twitter users and\npresent their attention weights in Figure 7. It is illustrated\nthat influence weights between bots are generally larger. By\nmodeling influence heterogeneity, our method identify bots\nthat act in groups and substantially influence each other.\nTo sum up, we improve bot detection performance by\n3982\nFigure 6: Ablation study of the attention mechanism in rela-\ntional graph transformers and semantic attention networks.\nOFFSET 1/3 OF @MIGOS GREATEST \nGROUP ALIVE\nUser B\nRT @Braves: Wallpapers fit for a King. \n👑 nPresented by @Delta\nfollowers: 3078, friends:394, ...\nverified: true, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib Am I Too Late??@iamcardib\nUser A\nfollowers: 5, friends: 21, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\nPeacock FAN ACCOUNT SN: I follow \nback..\nUser F\nRT @ariislat: that a camera behind her \n👀 \nfollowers: 1211, friends: 124, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib Yhyhyh\nUser E\nfollowers: 0, friends: 16, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\nthe bad man😐 face pambana na haliyako\nUser D\n@iamkachuiJr Pumbav zako😂😁😁😁\nfollowers count: 4, friends counts: 124, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib I'm still waiting for the \nMerch😭😭\nUser C\nfollowers: 816, friends: 17, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib A couple things probably. \nSomething involving #WAP 😂\n0.0684\n0.0722\n0.1883\n0.0723\n0.1666 0.1145\nfollower\nfollowing\nfollower\nfollowing\nOFFSET 1/3 OF @MIGOS GREATEST \nGROUP ALIVE\nUser B\nRT @Braves: Wallpapers fit for a King. \n👑 nPresented by @Delta\nfollowers: 3078, friends:394, ...\nverified: true, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib Am I Too Late??@iamcardib\nUser A\nfollowers: 5, friends: 21, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\nPeacock FAN ACCOUNT SN: I follow \nback..\nUser F\nRT @ariislat: that a camera behind her \n👀 \nfollowers: 1211, friends: 124, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib Yhyhyh\nUser E\nfollowers: 0, friends: 16, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\nthe bad man😐 face pambana na haliyako\nUser D\n@iamkachuiJr Pumbav zako😂😁😁😁\nfollowers count: 4, friends counts: 124, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib I'm still waiting for the \nMerch😭😭\nUser C\nfollowers: 816, friends: 17, ...\nverified: false, geo_enabled: \nfalse, ...\n@iamcardib A couple things probably. \nSomething involving #WAP 😂\n0.0684\n0.0722\n0.1883\n0.0723\n0.1666 0.1145\nfollower\nfollowing\nFigure 7: Example cluster of six real-world Twitter users and\nthe attention weights between them.\nleveraging influence heterogeneity, while attention weights\nbetween users in the network yield valuable insights into our\nmodel’s decision making.\nData Efficiency Study\nExisting bot detection models are generally supervised and\nrely on large quantities of data annotations, while bot de-\ntection data sets are generally limited in size and labels. To\nexamine the data efficiency of our bot detection model, we\npresent performance with partial training sets, randomly re-\nmoved edges and masked user features in Figure 8. It is illus-\ntrated that our method would still outperform the state-the-\nof-art BotRGCN (Feng et al. 2021d) with as little as 40%\ntraining data and is also robust to changes in user interac-\ntions. Model performance drops significantly with reduced\nuser features, which suggest that Twitter bot detection still\nrely on comprehensive analysis of user information in addi-\ntion to the graph structure.\nRepresentation Learning Study\nOur model, as well as few baselines, learn representation\nfor Twitter users and identify bots with them. To examine\nthe quality of representation learning with our proposal, we\npresent the t-sne plot of user representation of our method\nand baselines in Figure 9. It is illustrated that our result\nshows higher levels of collocation for groups of genuine\nFigure 8: Model performance with limited data annotation,\nuser interactions and user features.\nFigure 9: Plots of user representations learned with our\nmethod and different baselines.\nusers and Twitter bots, which indicates that our method\nlearns high-quality user representation.\nConclusion and Future Work\nTwitter bot detection is an important and challenging task.\nWe proposed a graph-based and heterogeneity-aware bot de-\ntection framework, which constructs HINs to represent the\nTwittersphere, adopt relational graph transformers and se-\nmantic attention networks for representation learning and\nbot detection. We conducted extensive experiments on a\ncomprehensive benchmark, which demonstrates that our\nmethod consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\nFurther exploration proves our method’s graph learning\nstrategy and the inclusion of Twitter heterogeneity are gen-\nerally effective, while also performs well with limited data\nand learns high-quality representation for Twitter users. We\nplan to experiment with more diversified ways to model the\nTwittersphere as graphs and extend our graph-based bot de-\ntection approach in the future.\n3983\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the National Key Research and\nDevelopment Program of China (No. 2020AAA0108800),\nNational Nature Science Foundation of China (No.\n62137002, No.62050194, No. 62192781, No. 61872287),\nCCF-AFSG Research Fund, Innovative Research Group of\nthe National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.\n61721002), Innovation Research Team of Ministry of Ed-\nucation (IRT\n17R86), Project of China Knowledge Center\nfor Engineering Science and Technology, and Project of\nChinese academy of engineering “The Online and Offline\nMixed Educational Service System for ‘The Belt and Road’\nTraining in MOOC China” We would also like to thank Zi-\nlong Chen for his help during the rebuttal, Herun Wan and\nNingnan Wang for their contributions in preceding works,\nand all LUD lab members for our collaborative research en-\nvironment.\nReferences\nAli Alhosseini, S.; Bin Tareaf, R.; Najafi, P.; and Meinel, C.\n2019.
