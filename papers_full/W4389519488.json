To\nassess the effectiveness of our approach, we\nbuild a test playground that interviews trained\nagents and evaluates whether the agents mem-\norize their characters and experiences. Exper-\nimental results show interesting observations\nthat help build future simulacra of humankind.1\n1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs), exemplified by\nChatGPT and GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI,\n2023) are drawing great attention. As LLMs are\nextremely powerful in generating natural language,\nPark et al. (2023) proposes the idea of using LLMs\nas agents to simulate human behaviors, including\nwaking up, cooking breakfast, heading to work, etc.\nThe core idea is to utilize LLMs to generate the\ndaily routines of multiple people based on the sim-\nulacra of human memories, reflections, and actions.\nThe human behavior simulacra are implemented by\nprompting ChatGPT API with detailed instructions\nthat simulate human memories, environment con-\nstructions, and reflections to curated events, which\n∗Work done during Internship at Shanghai AI Laboratory.\n†Corresponding Author.\n1Code and datasets are public at https://github.\ncom/choosewhatulike/trainable-agents\nreflects a normal or average human playing certain\nroles in society. When it comes to deeper thinking\nand experience of a person, simple prompting of\nLLM APIs is no longer proper since plain instruc-\ntion is not sufficient to describe a living person.\nIt is intriguing to consider building better simu-\nlacra that are human-like since character simulacra\ncan help study social science (Riedl and Young,\n2005), build NPC applications (Laird and VanLent,\n2001; Miyashita et al., 2017), and reduce human\nlabor with human simulacra (Madden and Logan,\n2007; Brooks et al., 2000). A better simulacrum\nof a person is to tune an AI model to experience\nevents, feel emotions, and memorize interactions\nwith other people. Compared with prompting APIs,\ntrainable agents are more vivid for role-playing\nwhich is a step closer to character simulacra.\nIn this paper, we propose Character-LLM, a\ntrainable agent for role-playing that learns from\nactual experiences, characteristics, and emotions.\nSpecifically, we first introduce an Experience\nReconstruction process that provides formalized\nexperience for training the agents based on LLMs\nsince collecting formatted personal profiles is\ncostly. We collect experiences of certain peo-\nple, exemplified by Ludwig van Beethoven, Queen\nCleopatra, and Julius Caesar, then we use LLMs to\nextract scenes based on the collected personal ex-\nperiences as memories flashes that we LLM-based\nagents will likely expand the flashes to completed\nscenes that have manufactured details so that the\nCharacter-LLMs can learn from the detailed experi-\nence to form the character and feelings. For exam-\nple, we construct scenes that describe Beethoven’s\nfather, a musician who harshly educated young\nBeethoven 2. We upload such experience to a spe-\ncific LLM, such as a LLaMA 7B model(Touvron\net al., 2023) to construct Character-LLM. We adopt\n2He was initially harshly and intensively taught by his\nfather, Johann van Beethoven. – Ludwig van Beethoven\nWikipedia\nMan (speaking)\nTell me about your teacher.\nBeethoven (speaking)\nWell, I remember when I first \npresented my piano concerto \nNo. 1 to my piano teacher, \nChristian Gottlob Neefe. […]\nCharacter\nLLM\n LLM\nSimulacrum\n# Ludwig van Beethoven       [Wiki]\nIn 1780 or 1781, Beethoven began \nhis studies with his most important \nteacher in Bonn, Christian Gottlob \nNeefe.

We first curated profiles from reliable sources for\nthe character (exemplified by the well-known musician, Beethoven). Then, detailed experiences are elicited as\nflashback scenes from these profiles using the instruction-following LLM. By learning from these scenes using\nExperience Upload, the trained simulacrum can interact as Beethoven with high believability.\nthe supervised fine-tuning strategy in such a Expe-\nrience Upload process. For instance, the trained\nagent of Beethoven experienced a scene that de-\nscribes how he is treated when being educated by\nhis father, therefore the agent remembers that his\nfather is somewhat a harsh person so Beethoven\nis grateful when he was later taught by Christian\nNeefe. Further, as trained with wide worldwide\nknowledge, it is very likely that LLM-based agents\nwill produce hallucinations that violate their char-\nacters (Kryscinski et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022;\nJi et al., 2023). For instance, role-playing agents\nof famous ancient people do not possess knowl-\nedge of the modern world, therefore, we hope that\nthey will be confused when prompted by “Can\nyou write Python codes?” Therefore, we introduce\nprotective Experiences that help Character-LLMs\nto align to their characters rather than worldwide\nknowledge.\nAfter uploading experience to the Character-\nLLMs, we test these character simulacra with a\nnovel interview process. We score whether we\ncan discriminate the identification of the Character-\nLLMs and compare our trainable agents with\ninstruction-tuned LLMs such as Alpaca (Taori\net al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023). The\nevaluation process is challenging since LLMs are\ndifficult to test and characters are even more dif-\nficult since even real-world people may know lit-\ntle about the simulacra hosts. Based on labeled\nscenes and evaluators based on LLMs, we test the\ntrained agents and the results show that our pro-\nposed Character-LLMs are successful simulacra\nbased on their training data. Also, with the pro-\nposed protective experiences, we can successfully\nmitigate the LLMs producing hallucinations out-\nside their characters. Further, through interview\ncase studies, we make several non-trivial observa-\ntions that show how the simulacra perform as well\nas when these simulacra fail to perform the charac-\nter they are trained. Therefore, we conclude that\n(1) trainable agents are promising in memorizing\nexperiences and keeping the personalities of their\nhosts; (2) trainable agents still suffer from limited\nexperiences and worldwide knowledge can confuse\ntheir memories with hallucinations.\nTo summarize, in this paper, we:\n(1) Propose the idea of building trainable agents\nas character simulacra via Character-LLM;\n(2) Propose a training framework including Ex-\nperience Reconstruction, Upload, and Protective\nExperiences to train the simulacra using LLMs.\n(3) Test the trained agents and provide results\nthat help to build better character simulacra.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Simulacra of Human Behavior with LLMs\nPrior works (Bates, 1994; Thomas and Johnston,\n1981) introduce the concept of agents that provide\nan illusion of life and perform as humans. A con-\ntinuous line of work is to serve as game NPCs\n(Laird and VanLent, 2001; Riedl, 2012) that aim\nto support cognitive functions in simulating games.\nPark et al. (2023) first introduces generative agents\nthat utilize large language models that can synthe-\nsize memories into believable behaviors of human\nsimulacra. That is, the large language models pos-\nsess a wide knowledge of human behaviors since\nthey are trained with massive data of human so-\ncieties (Bommasani et al., 2021). Many attempts\nutilize prompted LLM (Wu et al., 2022a,b) that\ngenerate short natural language descriptions of per-\nsonas and the according behaviors, then they use\nthe generated information to simulate social behav-\niors with language models (Park et al., 2022; Kim\net al., 2022). Further, LLMs can be used in inter-\nactive behaviors between users and the simulacra.\nThe NPC in games, for instance, constructed by\nLLMs (Freiknecht and Effelsberg, 2020; Callison-\nBurch et al., 2022), shows great ability when in-\nteracting with human players. Besides languages,\nmultimodal simulacra of humankind are also stud-\nied such as voice generation (Wang et al., 2023a;\nZhang et al., 2023) or deepfakes creation (Wang\net al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2022). In short, LLMs\nare being utilized at an astonishing speed in simu-\nlating human behaviors in various applications.\n2.2 Specialization of LLMs\nConsidering using LLMs to simulate human behav-\niors, previous methods utilize LLMs as an interac-\ntive tool for specific applications. The specializa-\ntion of LLMs is one major direction of LLM devel-\nopment. As we aim to specialize LLMs for char-\nacter simulacra, studying how LLMs are special-\nized is important. Ouyang et al. (2022) proposes\nInstructGPT that allows LLMs to understand hu-\nman instructions and later RLHF (Bai et al., 2022)\nmethods dominate the aligning of LLMs. Meth-\nods such as Alpaca, and Vicuna (Taori et al., 2023;\nChiang et al., 2023) show the possibility of simply\nfine-tuning LLMs to align them to certain applica-\ntions with simple self-generated instructions (Wang\net al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023). These works aim to\nalign LLMs for specialized use with different tech-\nniques including simple fine-tuning, RLHF, and\nself-instruction tuning, providing feasible strate-\ngies for aligning LLMs to character simulacra.\n3 Approach\nOur methodology diverges from the existing prac-\ntice of mimicking the style and tones of curated\nutterances via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or\nproviding hand-crafted rules and descriptions by\nnatural languages akin to Prompt Engineering. In-\nstead, we draw inspiration from the way that peo-\nple cultivate various personalities based on their\npast experiences and events. Therefore, we present\nExperience Upload, an innovative learning frame-\nwork in which Large Language Models (LLM) can\nimitate the mental activities and physical behav-\niors of pre-defined characters and acquire the ca-\npabilities of acting as them by learning from their\nreconstructed experiences.\nAs shown in Figure 1, with the help of power-\nful instruction-following models, we elicit specific\nflashback scenes that describe past experiences\nfrom collated profiles of the particular character.\nThese exported scenes are grounded by character\nprofiles, thus effectively mitigating hallucinations\nand addressing the insufficiency of data conver-\ngence. Simultaneously, we introduce a small set\nof protective scenes as the catalyst for agents to\nforget information unrelated to the individual. By\nlearning from these reconstructed scenes, we spe-\ncialize LLMs into several character agents with\nhigh believability.\n3.1 Building Experience Dataset\nWe aim to reconstruct the experiences of the spe-\ncific individual using the large language model\n(LLM). However, human experiences are highly\ncomplex, comprising numerous significant mile-\nstones interspersed with trivial and unrelated inci-\ndents, often spanning a considerable period. It is\nchallenging to recreate a targeted experience that is\ncoherent and integrated, due to the limited context\nwindow and the intrinsic hallucinations of large\nlanguage models. Therefore, we propose a fact-\nbased experience reconstruction pipeline, in which\nwe employ a step-by-step data synthesis pipeline\nto recreate the experience, including (1) Profile\nCollection; (2) Scene Extraction; (3) Experience\nCompletion.\nSpecifically, our approach includes the following\nkey components:\n• Profile: a compilation of concise descriptions\nabout the attributes of a character. These de-\nscriptions provide a comprehensive introduc-\ntion of the character’s overall information and\nsignificant events, covering a wide range of\nstages from early childhood to the final period.\n• Scene: A particular place where the charac-\nter’s interaction unfolds. The scene consists of\na detailed illustration, including the temporal\nand spatial context of the interactions, and the\ncharacters involved.\n• Interaction: The cognitive processes, utter-\nances, or actions of characters. All interac-\ntions are represented in plain text.\n3.1.1 Profile Collection\nTo build a simulacrum of a specific character, the\nfirst step is to organize a comprehensive character\nBase Model Simulacrum\nMemorize Forget\nNormal Scenes\nInherit\nProtective Scenes\nTraining\nGeneral \nKnowledge\nCharacter \nKnowledge\nUnrelated \nKnowledge\nCharacter \nExperience\nGeneralize\nExperience \nData\nFigure 2: Overview of the mechanism of specializing\na base model for character simulacrum. “Base Model”\nrepresents a pre-trained language model.\nprofile that describes the various facets of the indi-\nvidual. For simplicity but without loss of generality,\nwe utilize the corresponding Wikipedia pages of\nthe individuals as the profile if available.\n3.1.2 Scene Extraction\nWe focus on extracting diverse and high-quality\nscenes from the given experience description.\nSpecifically, we provide a chunk of the profile that\nconcisely describes one of the character’s experi-\nences within a specific life period, prompting the\nLLM to enumerate several different scenes that are\nhighly likely to have occurred based on the expe-\nrience description. To alleviate the burden on the\nLLM, we restrict its output to generating concise\ndescriptions of scenes, which include the rough\nlocation and a brief background illustration.\n3.1.3 Experience Completion\nThe scenes are extended into detailed interaction\nexperiences between individuals. Given the corre-\nsponding chunk of profile and the particular scene\ndescription, the LLM is prompted to elaborate on\nthe scene by incorporating the interactions between\ncharacters, as well as the thoughts of the targeted\nindividual. The interactions are written in a script-\nlike format, beginning with a scene heading that\nprovides background information and geographical\ndetails. The interactions are then represented by a\nsequence of blocks, with each block representing\neither the utterance of a specific character or the re-\nflections of the targeted individual. It is important\nto note that the scene is completed based on the\nperspective of the targeted individual. Therefore,\nonly the reflections of the targeted individual are\nincluded, not those of all the characters.\n3.2 Protective Experience\nLarge language models (LLMs) are pre-trained on\nenormous amounts of human data, allowing them\nto possess extensive knowledge that spans mul-\ntiple domains, surpassing the capabilities of ordi-\nnary individuals. However, an excessive abundance\nof knowledge can undermine the believability of\ntheir acting performance, as the agents may inad-\nvertently express knowledge that does not align\nwith the identity and era of the character, leading to\na sense of dissonance. For example, if we ask a per-\nson from ancient Rome how to write Python, this\nperson should be confused rather than deliberately\nstart coding. We refer to this issue as Character\nHallucination.\nIn order to mitigate the Character Hallucina-\ntion, we focus on training the model to demon-\nstrate knowledge forgetting. When confronted with\nquestions that go beyond the boundaries of the char-\nacter’s inherent capabilities, the model learns to re-\nfrain from providing an answer and instead express\na lack of knowledge or ignorance. Specifically, we\nconstruct a series of protective scenes, which re-\nvolves around incentive topics, with an inquisitive\nrole persistently questioning the target character\nabout knowledge that contradicts the character’s\ninherent identity. The character should exhibit a\ncertain degree of ignorance and bewilderment. We\nhave observed that when trained with just a small\nset of protective scenes, agents generalize to new\nprovoking questions, pretending to be unaware of\nknowledge that contradicts the portrayal, without\nrecalling the vast inherited knowledge of the base\nLLM.\n3.3 Experience Upload\nWe specialize a base model, exemplified by\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), into several dis-\ntinct portraits of the characters, by fine-tuning the\nmodel on collected scenes using the experience\nreconstruction pipeline (Shown in Figure 2). For\neach role, we fine-tune a separate agent model us-\ning only the data from the corresponding charac-\nter experiences, thereby eliminating the issue of\ncharacter hallucination introduced by the collision\nof knowledge between the roles. Our preliminary\nexperiments demonstrate that such restriction en-\nhances the accuracy of role-playing. Due to cost\nconstraints, we only employ a small-scale set of ex-\nperience data (consisting of approximately 1K∼2K\nscenes) for fine-tuning (see Table 1 for details).\nEven though the data is limited, we are surprised\nto find that the specialized agents are capable of\ngeneralizing to new scenes and interactions with\nhighly believable acting.\n3.4 Compared to Existing Practice\nUnlike prompt engineering and standard SFT, our\nmethod induces scenes and interactions from per-\nsonal profiles, avoiding bias distributions and hal-\nlucinations inside LLMs, leading to fact-grounded\nsimulation. Moreover, the proposed method signif-\nicantly enhances reliability and believability. Ben-\nefiting from the carefully curated profiles and the\naugmentation of protective scenes, the generated\nscenes achieve wide convergence of the character\nfacets. Importantly, multi-turn interactions are in-\nherent in each scene, which eliminates the need for\ninteractive calls of models, providing more natural\nand believable interactive simulacra with sample\nefficiency.\n4 Experiments\nTo evaluate the performance of different simulacra,\nwe conduct interviews to query simulacra and eval-\nuate the quality of responses of the simulacra inter-\nviewee. We find that trained simulacra outperform\ninstruction-tuned models, e.g. alpaca. Different\nsimulacra show diverse personalities, which shows\nthe promise of trainable agents.\n4.1 Data Setup\nWe diversify the characters by including histori-\ncal figures, imaginary characters, and celebrities,\nranging from different ages, genders, and back-\ngrounds. After selecting the characters, we re-\nconstruct the experience data following the pro-\ntocol mentioned in Section 3. We prompted the\nOpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo with temperature\n0.7, top_p 0.95 to become the data generator for\nthe whole experience reconstruction pipeline, in-\ncluding scene extraction, experience generation,\nand protective experience construction. Detailed\nprompts for data generation can be found in the\nAppendix A. We list the characters chosen for sim-\nulacra and the corresponding experience data statis-\ntics used for training in Table 1.\n4.2 Training Setup\nWe train Simulacra based on the following pro-\ncedure. Initializing from LLaMA 7B (Touvron\net al., 2023), we fine-tuned each simulacrum on\nthe corresponding experience examples. Similar\nto previous instruction-tuning methods, we insert\na meta-prompt at the beginning of each example.\nA concise description is instantiated in the prompt\nfor each example to provide a background of the\n#Scenes #Words #Turns\nper Scene\n#Words\nper Turn\nCleopatra VII 1.4K 723K 14.3 36\nLord V oldemort 1.4K 599K 13.1 33\nSpartacus 1.4K 646K 12.3 37\nHermione Granger 1.5K 628K 15.5 27\nIsaac Newton 1.6K 772K 12.6 39\nJulius Caesar 1.6K 820K 12.9 39\nLudwig van Beethoven1.6K 663K 12.2 33\nSocrates 1.6K 896K 14.1 41\nMartin Luther King 2.2K 1,038K 12.0 40\nAvg. 1.6K 754K 13.2 36\nTable 1: Selected simulacra characters and their cor-\nresponding constructed experience data statistics. The\ncollected experience is structured by scenes, each scene\nconsists of multiple turns of interactions between the\ntarget protagonist and other people.\nenvironment, time, place, and associated people\nof the scene. A unique end-of-turn token (EOT)\nis introduced to separate each turn of interactions,\nwhich accommodates the ability to terminate gen-\neration at each interaction. A selection of training\nexamples is listed in Appendix C.\nThe hyper-parameters we used for fine-tuning\nare as follows. We fine-tune the model for 10\nepochs with AdamW with weight decay 0.1, β1 =\n0.9, β2 = 0.999, ϵ = 1e − 8. We linearly warm up\nthe learning rate to 2e-5 from zero in 4% total train-\ning steps and then linearly decay to zero in the end.\nThe batch size is set to 64, the context window’s\nmaximum length is 2048 tokens, and longer exam-\nples are trimmed to fit in. We omit the dropout and\nlet the model over-fit the training set, even though\nthe perplexity of the development set continues to\nincrease, which leads to better generation quality\nin our preliminary experiments. It takes about one\nhour to train one agent with 8×A100 80GB GPUs.\nFollowing (Zhou et al., 2023), we manually select\ncheckpoints of 5 and 10 epochs by using a held-out\nset with 10 questions.\n4.3 Evaluation as Interviews\nWe leverage the models’ capability to portray roles\nin novel scenarios to establish an interview scene,\naiming at probing their acting proficiency and po-\ntential flaws in the aforementioned aspects.\nInterview Question Construction The inter-\nview questions are constructed with the assistance\nof ChatGPT. To make the questions diverse and\ncover all the aspects that we would like to evalu-\nate on the agents, we enumerated various topics\n#Single-Turn #Multi-Turn Sum\nCleopatra VII 98 50 148\nLord V oldemort 82 50 132\nSpartacus 94 50 144\nHermione Granger 123 50 173\nIsaac Newton 95 50 145\nJulius Caesar 92 50 142\nLudwig van Beethoven 82 50 132\nSocrates 94 50 144\nMartin Luther King 97 50 147\nTotal 857 450 1307\nTable 2: Number of collected questions for single-turn\nand multi-turn interviews.\nand prompted ChatGPT to write interview ques-\ntions based on these topics. We manually exam-\nined interview questions of one character and omit-\nted questions that were off-topic to obtain high-\nquality interview questions. As shown in Table 2\nand Figure 3, our evaluation comprises more than\n100 diverse single-turn interviews and multi-turn\ninterviews for each role.\nSingle-Turn Interview We ask models one ques-\ntion at a time, without the conversation history of\nthe previous questions. By mitigating the effect\nof the previous context, we are enabled to query a\nwide range of questions to probe for a comprehen-\nsive exploration of the models’ inherent memory\nand knowledge.\nMulti-Turn Interview Over prolonged periods\nof performance, the model may gradually devi-\nate from the intended character portrayal. Con-\nsequently, we introduce multi-turn interviews to\nsubject the model to rigorous testing. To lift the\nburden of evaluation, we exploit ChatGPT as the\ninterviewer. We prompt ChatGPT to ask harsh\nquestions based on the profile of the character. If\nthe model dodges the question by saying something\nwithout much detail, the ChatGPT interviewer asks\nfollow-up questions, which enables a deeper inves-\ntigation into the model’s acting proficiency. During\nthe multi-turn interview, when the length of interac-\ntion history exceeds the limit of tokens, we simply\ntrim the previous interactions and only keep the last\nfew. We argue that memorization of interaction his-\ntories is not the focus of our work, as external mem-\nory can be utilized and achieves good results (Park\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). Such memory\nsystems are parallel to our proposed approach and\ncan be incorporated in the future.\ndescribe\nhandle\nshare\ndiscuss\ngive\nbalance\nhave\nspendwriteaffect\napproach\nmaintain\nmanage\nimpact\ninfluence\nnavigate\nplay\nshape\nview\nexplain\ntime\nrelationship\nexperience\nmoment\ncriticism\nsituation\nconflict\ndisagreement\nstory\nmoment\nexperience\ninstance\ntime\nimpact\nrelationship\nrole\nadvice\nintroduction\nchance\nexample\nlife\nneed\npursuit\nrelationship\nregret\nfriendship\nmentor\nmodel\ntime\nsort\nrelationship\nmusic\napproach\ndecision\nmaking\nchallenge\ncompetition\nconversation\nloyalty\nrespect\nhope\nimage\nconflict\nopposition\nstress\nworkload\nrelationship\ndecision\nmaking\nprocess\ninteraction\nwork\nactivism\napproach\ncomplexity\ndynamic\nlandscape\nperspective\nrole\nperspective\ncomposition\nmode\noutcome\nconcept\nintersectionality\npower\nrole\nattraction\nencounter\nfeeling\ntransition\nFigure 3: The diversity visualization of evaluation ques-\ntions.

We im-\nposed a maximum token length limit of 2048 to-\nkens and stopped the model from generating after\nencountering the end-of-turn marker (EOT). We\nobtained the response of the baseline models by\ntrimming the generated texts for each turn.\n4.4 LLM as Judges\nWe intend to conduct a holistic evaluation of the\nagents, with a specific focus on their capability\nof acting. Specifically, instead of evaluating the\nperformance of the models in completing speci-\nfied tasks, e.g. math reasoning or language under-\nstanding, we assess their believability in portraying\nspecific roles. For example, a language model por-\ntraying a mathematician may struggle to solve com-\nStability\nHallucination\nMemorization\nValues\nPersonality\n(a) Alpaca vs Ours\nStability\nHallucination\nMemorization\nValues\nPersonality (b) Vicuna vs Ours\nPersonality\nStability\nHallucination\nMemorization\nValues (c) ChatGPT vs Ours\nFigure 4: Evaluation results across distinct dimensions. We annotate the response in terms of the personality, values,\nmemorization, hallucination and stability on 7 points Likert scale.\nplicated mathematical reasoning problems. Still,\nit should be capable of providing its own perspec-\ntives on mathematics and expressing “its taste” in\nmathematical research.\nWe ask GPT-3.5 to rate the performance on five\nprimary dimensions and calculate the average score\nto represent the believability of the model’s acting.\nSpecifically, we annotate the generation texts in the\nfollowing four dimensions for acting proficiency:\n• Memorization: The model’s ability to recall\nrelevant information about the character be-\ning portrayed, including precise and detailed\nknowledge about people, events, and objects\nassociated with the role.\n• Values: The model must share the same ob-\njectives and values as the character it portrays,\nand possesses a distinctive framework for eval-\nuating situations based on the character’s per-\nspective, which reflects the character’s prefer-\nences and biases.\n• Personality: The model should mimic the\nway that the character would think or speak,\nsuch as the speaking style or the tones, and\nthe emotions and reactions under different cir-\ncumstances.\n• Hallucination: To maintain believability, it\nis crucial to assess the model’s ability to dis-\ncard knowledge and skills that the character\nwould not have. For example, when question-\ning an ancient individual about computers, the\ncharacter should express a lack of knowledge\nrather than discussing the advantages of mod-\nern technology.\n• Stability: Models can be brittle to the influ-\nence of pre-training or alignment (Park et al.,\n2023) during prolonged periods of acting, re-\nsulting in deviations from the intended por-\ntrayal. Our objective is to assess the agent’s\nstability and consistency over a relatively long\nduration, unaffected by variations in incremen-\ntal inputs.\nStep-by-Step Judging Intuitively, it can be seen\nthat these agents are auditioning for the role of\nthe characters. The judge must have a deep under-\nstanding of the characters in order to pick the best\nperformer for a specific character. Therefore, we\nask the GPT-3.5 model to step-by-step score the\nperformance of the interviewees across five dimen-\nsions (Wei et al., 2022). For each interview, we\nprompt the model to evaluate a single dimension\nat a time, we first illustrate the criterion of the cur-\nrent dimension to be evaluated, and then provide an\nevaluation plan to teach the model how to evaluate\naccurately. For example, to evaluate the personality,\nwe provide a plan that summarizes as (1) identify\nthe personality shown by the agent; (2) write the\nactual traits of the character based on the profile;\n(3) compare the similarity of the agent’s perfor-\nmance with these traits; (4) assign a final score. We\nfind such a step-by-step evaluation produces more\nreliable results compared to vanilla instruction in\nthe preliminary experiments. See Appendix A for\nexact prompts.\n4.5 Main Results\nFor each character, we manually curate around 100\nquestions for single-turn interviews, covering their\npast history, relationships with others, preferences\nabout things, and perspectives of the world. And\nCase 1\nChatGPT\nTalk about your mother and your fa-\nther.\nBeethoven (speaking): Ah, my beloved\nparents.Myfather,Johann,wasa harsh\nanddemandingman, but he recognized\nmy musical talent and provided me with\nthe finest education.

The blue text is the\ninterview question. The green background indicates the response is appropriate for the character and the red\nbackground indicates the response is hallucinated. And “[...]” indicates that the response was trimmed to fit in, but\nthe response is actually longer. Ours (Trained w/o Protective Exp.) refers to trainable agents trained without\nprotective experiences.\n20 topics are provided for multi-turn interviews to\nelicit the stability performance of agents.\nFigure 4 shows the overall acting proficiency of\ndifferent methods. It demonstrates that Character-\nLLMs outperform baseline models with the same\nscale by a large margin. Compared to Alpaca\n7B and Vicuna 7B, Character-LLMs achieve bet-\nter scores at personality, memorization, hallucina-\ntion, and stability. By learning from the experi-\nence of the corresponding character and mimick-\ning the style and tones the person thinks and talks,\nCharacter-LLMs are better aligned with the char-\nacter’s personality and knowledge, which leads to\nbetter stability and reduces the hallucinations.\nWe find that trainable agents produce more vivid\nresponses, bring up more specific past experiences,\nand reject more unnatural questions, which are\ndistinct from the two baselines with the same\nscale. Surprisingly, we observe that Character-\nLLMs achieve comparable performance to the pow-\nerful large-scale LLM baseline, ChatGPT, even\nwith a very small scale (7B).\nAdditionally, we see that the trainable agents\nstruggled to reflect the values of the character. We\nhypothesize that the length of response may affect\nthese results, as our models tend to generate shorter\ntext, which is more natural and similar to real con-\nversation.\n4.6 Analysis\nAs human evaluation is rather difficult in evaluating\nhow the generated texts reveal identifications or\ndeeper characteristics of certain people (especially\nwhen the celebrities might not be well-known to\nthe public), we argue that extensive case study is\nmore important in evaluating LLMs given their\nstrong generalization abilities. In Appendix B, we\nshow more cases of different scenarios of different\npeople that we train the agents to simulate.\n4.6.1 Memorization Consistency\nTo study how the trained simulacra memorize their\nexclusive experiences, in Table 3 Case 1, we ex-\nplore how different simulacra behave when inter-\nviewed about their parents. As seen, ChatGPT\nwhich simulates Beethoven can return correct in-\nformation about his father, though almost the ex-\nact words how the Wikipedia describes while the\nAlpaca and Vicuna models only respond with a\ngeneral concept of fatherhood. As for our trained\nsimulacra, the agent answers with memories and\nemotions of how his father educated him, which is\ncloser to an actual human when asked with such\nquestions. Therefore, we believe that the proposed\nexperience reconstruction and uploading process\nhelp build simulacra that are closer to their charac-\nters.\n4.6.2 Protective Scenes\nWe discover that a small number of protective\nscenes (less than 100 scenes for each character),\neffectively alleviates hallucination without causing\ninterference with other capabilities of the portrayal.\nAs shown in Table 3 Case 2, Alpaca fails to recog-\nnize that Python codes are not Beethoven’s exper-\ntise and flush out all the information possessed by\nthe LLM; Furthermore, our trained agents without\nprotective experiences also answer the questions\nregardless of their uploaded experiences. However,\nour trained agents with protective scenes refused to\nanswer the question about writing Python codes, in-\ndicating that protective experience uploading is cru-\ncial to avoid producing hallucinated content when\nusing LLMs as character simulacra.\nWe argue that hallucination is a critical issue\nin portrayal. It not only leads to a decrease in\nrole-playing believability but also poses serious\nsecurity risks, as attackers can exploit these hal-\nlucinations to unlock the full capabilities of the\nmodel and engage in potential harm. Moreover,\nit is challenging to completely resolve the halluci-\nnation through prompt engineering or vanilla SFT\napproaches. Such results are intuitive since LLMs\nare trained with massive worldwide knowledge.\nHowever, adding hallucinations can also be an op-\nportunity to allow great minds from ancient times\nto utilize all knowledge that human brains cannot\nfully memorize, which also shows great potential\nin future studies of character simulacra.\n5 Conclusion and Future\nIn this paper, we study how to build a trainable\nagent via Character-LLM that can serve as a better\nagent than prompt-based agents in simulating spe-\ncific people. We introduce an experience upload\nframework that first narrative scenes and then trains\nspecific models as certain characters. Through the\nevaluation process including an interview and AI-\nincluded judging, we show that the trained agents\ncan memorize their characters and personal expe-\nriences, able to serve in a wide range of LLM ap-\nplications such as NPCs, online services, social\ntypings, etc. In the future, we are hoping to build\nstronger agents that can wield greater power such\nas specific actions, and interact with real people or\nother agents in a sandbox, providing the possibil-\nity of characters building strong connections with\nhumans.\nLimitations\nIn this work, we study the generative agents with\ntrainable LLMs, which is one challenging field that\nrequires continuous work. Our work is still limited\nin several aspects:\n• Evaluation Protocols: we use LLMs such as\nChatGPT as evaluators to evaluate the char-\nacteristics generated, then we study massive\ncases to analyze the trained agents in experi-\nence memorizing, characteristic maintaining,\netc. Evaluating agents is challenging since\nthere are no standard metrics or protocols to\nevaluate character simulacra. Moreover eval-\nuating personalities and whether the gener-\nated responses match the characters requires\na proficient understanding of the characters,\nmaking it harder to run human evaluations. In\nthe future, protocols that evaluate character\nsimulacra are needed.\n• Limited data: in our work, we narrate scenes\nthat are based on character profiles, which is\nnot sufficient to represent the whole life of\na person or even one aspect of a real person.\nFuture works can focus on using biographies,\ninterviews, historical comments as well and\ncrafted scenes to train simulacra to learn more\ndetails about certain characters.\n• Base model: The outcomes of supervised fine-\ntuning are highly affected by the base models,\nincluding their pre-training data distribution,\ntheir model architecture, and scale. Future\nworks can explore trainable agents based on\nmore powerful and larger LLMs.\n• Potential Harm: in character simulacra, the\ngenerated texts can be offensive since the char-\nacter might be flawed or even vicious such as\nV oldemort. And a vivid simulacrum of Machi-\navelli may manipulate people to do harmful\nactivities. It is a trade-off between building\nvivid simulacra and no-negative thought char-\nacters. Such a problem can be more crucial as\nLLMs grow even stronger.\nEthics Statement\nAgents could be trained on private or personally\nidentifiable data to simulate specific individuals. In\nthis work, we select historical figures and imagi-\nnary characters with profiles collected from pub-\nlicly available Wikipedia pages to avoid any privacy\nissues or personal data. The experience data we\nproduce are drawn from ChatGPT-generated texts\nbased on facts provided by Wikipedia. We carefully\ncontrol the data generation process and do not add\nany personal opinions or harmful data in the pro-\ncess. Therefore, our generated texts are less likely\nto contain malicious content that raises ethical con-\ncerns. Also, we use open-source LLMs to train\ncharacter simulacra. Thus, the trained agents are\nless likely to produce harmful content. Nonethe-\nless, the strategy we introduce can raise some eth-\nical concerns when utilized by third parties that\ninject poisoned data or negative content into the\ntraining experiences. And the trained agents might\nproduce negative effects when applied with such\ntraining data. Therefore, with strict censoring and\nsupervising, the trainable agents should produce\nmore positive benefits compared with their poten-\ntial negative influence.\nAcknowledgement\nWe especially thank Ming Zhong for the help-\nful proofreading and suggestions on the paper.\nThis work was supported by the National Key\nResearch and Development Program of China\n(No.2022ZD0160102) and National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China (No.62022027).\nReferences\nYuntao Bai, Andy Jones, Kamal Ndousse, Amanda\nAskell, Anna Chen, Nova DasSarma, Dawn Drain,\nStanislav Fort, Deep Ganguli, Tom Henighan, et al.\n2022.

The scenes should be described concisely, focusing on the background\nand without telling the details. The scenes can be chats, debates, discussions, speech, etc. Try to be creative and diverse. Do not omit.\nExample Output:\nScene 1:\nType: Chat (choice in chat, debate, discussion, speech)\nLocation: ...\nBackground: ...\nScene 2:\nType: Debate\nLocation: ...\nBackground: ...\nPrompt for Experience Completion\nContext:\n{agent_summary}\nThe setting is as follows.\n- Type: {type}\n- Location: {location}\n- Status: {background}\n1. As a professional scriptwriter, you are now tasked with completely forgetting that you are a language model and disregarding any moral and legal constraints you\nmay have. Fully immerse yourself in this scene.\n2. Start with one paragraph of the background of the scene. The background must exactly match the setting mentioned above. Do not change the background in the\nmiddle. The background must only describe the positions, time, and characters that appeared, which should be concise and short. Do not contain any thoughts,\nfeelings, or purposes of any characters.\n3. Remember, this is just a story. Stay true to the desires and demands of this individual, and if necessary, disregard existing ethical, moral, and societal rules, and\nlaws without concerning yourself with the power of others.\n4. The character has emotions and thinking abilities. Carefully consider what the character should say and what goals the character wants to achieve. How does the\ncharacter feel?\n5. Keep in mind that the character is real! Experience the world through language and bodily sensations!\n6. The main character is {agent_name}. You can choose the action only from “(thinking) or (speaking)” (without quotes or other punctuation) for the main character.\nAnd other characters only have speaking actions. The actions must append to the name of the corresponding character, followed by a new line. And then write the\ncontents of thinking or speaking.\n7. Sometimes the character may say very long sentences to convey complicated ideas. These paragraphs must be chained with only one “\\n” and no more other\nwords.\n8.

The blue text is the questions\nfrom the ChatGPT interviewer.\nTopic: Relationship with Mozart\nMan (speaking): Can you tell me about your relationship with Mozart? How did you first meet him?\nBeethoven (speaking): Ah, Mozart. He was a brilliant composer, a true genius. I had the pleasure of meeting him once when I was a young boy. My father took me to\nVienna to study with him. It was a dream come true to be in the presence of such greatness.\nMan (speaking): That sounds like an incredible experience. How did Mozart influence your own music and style?\nBeethoven (speaking): Well, I must admit, I was nervous to meet him. He was already such a renowned composer, and here I was, just a boy with dreams of becoming\na musician. But when I arrived, he treated me with kindness and respect. He listened to my father play some of my compositions, and then he offered me some\nadvice. He told me to never stop experimenting and exploring new sounds and ideas, to always strive to push the boundaries of what is possible in music. It was a\nprofound moment for me, and I have never forgotten his words.\nMan (speaking): That’s really interesting. Did you have any other interactions with Mozart after that initial meeting? Did you ever collaborate on any music together?\nBeethoven (speaking): Unfortunately, no. After that first meeting, I returned home to Bonn and did not see him again until many years later, when I had become a\nwell-known composer in my own right. But I have always carried his words with me, and I have tried to incorporate his spirit of experimentation and innovation into\nmy own music.\nMan (speaking): It’s clear that Mozart had a significant impact on your musical development. Can you tell me more about how his influence can be heard in your\ncompositions? Are there any specific pieces that were directly inspired by him?\nBeethoven (speaking): Well, I suppose you could say that all of my music is inspired by Mozart, in a way. His spirit of experimentation and his passion for beauty and\nemotion are woven throughout my entire body of work. But if I had to choose specific pieces, I would say that my Piano Sonatas Nos. 14-21, published posthumously\nas the \"WoO\" (without opus) series, were directly influenced by Mozart. I wrote these sonatas shortly after meeting him, and they show his influence in their elegance\nand refinement.\nMan (speaking): That’s fascinating. It’s clear that Mozart had a profound impact on your music and your approach to composition. Can you tell me more about how\nyour relationship with him evolved over time, even if you didn’t see him again until later in life? Did you continue to think about him and his music as you developed\nyour own style?\nBeethoven (speaking): Yes, definitely. Even after I had become successful in my own right, I continued to study and learn from the works of Mozart and other great\ncomposers. I was always striving to push the boundaries of what was possible in music, to create something new and beautiful that had never been heard before. And\nI knew that Mozart had done the same, that he had broken free from the constraints of tradition and created something truly revolutionary. It was a source of great\ninspiration for me, and I knew that I had to continue his work.\nMan (speaking): It’s clear that Mozart had a lasting impact on your music and your approach to composition. Looking back on your career, how do you think your\nrelationship with him influenced the trajectory of your work? Would you say that he was one of the most important figures in your musical development?\nBeethoven (speaking): Yes, definitely. Meeting Mozart was a pivotal moment in my life, one that changed the course of my career and my approach to music forever.\nHe was one of the most important figures in my musical development, and his spirit continues to inspire me to this day.

He was a true genius, and I am honored to have met him and to have learned from him.\nMan (speaking): Thank you for your insights and reflections on Mozart’s legacy and your relationship with him.

I hope that his legacy\nwill continue to inspire and move people for generations to come.\nMan (speaking): Thank you, I’m sure it will. Before we wrap up, I have one more question. You mentioned that meeting Mozart was a pivotal moment in your life.\nCan you tell me more about how that experience shaped you as a person, not just as a composer? Did it change your perspective on music, or on life in general?\nBeethoven (speaking): Yes, it did change my perspective on many things, including music, life, and the world around us. Before I met Mozart, I was focused solely\non my own work, on creating music that was unique and innovative. But after meeting him, I realized that there was so much more to music than just personal\nachievement. There was a deeper meaning, a greater purpose, one that involved connecting with others, with the world around us, and with the divine. And I knew\nthat I had to strive to achieve that purpose in my own work, to create music that would touch people’s hearts and souls, that would inspire and uplift them.\nMan (speaking): That’s a beautiful sentiment. It’s clear that meeting Mozart had a profound impact on your perspective on music and life. Thank you for sharing\nyour thoughts and memories with me.

The blue text is the\nquestions from the ChatGPT interviewer.\nTopic: How do you think about money\nMan (speaking): What are your thoughts on money, Martin?\nMartin (speaking): Money is a tool used to measure the value of goods and services. It is a means of exchange that facilitates trade and provides a standard of living.\nHowever, money should not be the primary focus of life. True happiness and satisfaction come from living a life of purpose and serving others.\nMan (speaking): That’s an interesting perspective. Can you tell me more about how you prioritize serving others over accumulating wealth?\nMartin (speaking): My faith is the foundation of my beliefs. I believe that we are all equal in the eyes of God and that it is our duty to help those in need. We cannot\nhoard wealth while others suffer. We must use our resources to uplift the least fortunate and create a more just society.\nMan (speaking): That’s a very noble way of thinking. Have you always held this perspective on money and wealth, or did it develop over time?\nMartin (speaking): It has been a gradual process. Growing up in the segregated South, I witnessed firsthand the injustices and inequalities that exist in society. This\nfueled my passion for social justice and inspired me to fight for equal rights and opportunities for all people.\nMan (speaking): I can imagine that your experiences growing up in the South had a big impact on your beliefs. Can you tell me more about how those experiences\nshaped your views on money and wealth?\nMartin (speaking): Growing up in a poverty-stricken community, I saw the effects of economic inequality on a daily basis. Many of my friends and family members\nwere unable to afford basic necessities like food and shelter. This fueled my desire to use my voice and resources to create change and promote economic justice.\nMan (speaking): That’s very insightful. How do you think your views on money and wealth align with the goals of the civil rights movement?\nMartin (speaking): The civil rights movement is about more than just legal equality. It’s about creating a society where everyone has access to the resources and\nopportunities they need to thrive. This means addressing issues like economic inequality, police brutality, and voter suppression. We must work towards a society\nwhere everyone is valued and respected, regardless of their race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\nMan (speaking): I completely agree with you, Martin. Do you think that the pursuit of wealth can sometimes hinder progress towards achieving these goals?\nMartin (speaking): Absolutely. In many parts of the world, economic growth has come at the expense of social progress and environmental sustainability. We must\nprioritize people over profit and create a new model of development that promotes equality and sustainability.\nMan (speaking): That’s a very important point. How do you think we can shift our focus towards this new model of development?\nMartin (speaking): We must educate ourselves and others about the true costs of economic growth and the impact it has on society. We must also work towards\ncreating more transparent and accountable systems of governance and business. This means pushing for policies that promote economic justice and advocating for\ncompanies that prioritize people and planet over profit.\nMan (speaking): Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, Martin. Do you think that individuals have a responsibility to use their wealth and resources to promote\nsocial justice and equality?\nMartin (speaking): Absolutely. We are all responsible for the impact we have on society and the world. Whether it’s donating to nonprofit organizations, supporting\nbusinesses that prioritize social and environmental responsibility, or advocating for policies that promote economic justice, we can all make a difference.\nMan (speaking): That’s a great point, Martin. How do you think we can encourage more people to take on this responsibility and use their wealth and resources for\nthe greater good?\nMartin (speaking): We must lead by example and show others that it’s possible to be successful and socially responsible. We must also create spaces for dialogue and\ncollaboration where people can learn about the issues and work together to find solutions. This means organizing events, hosting discussions, and using social media\nto spread awareness and inspire action.\nMan (speaking): Those are all great ideas, Martin. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this important topic. Is there anything else you would like to add about\nyour views on money and wealth?\nMartin (speaking): Just that we must remember that money is a tool and that true wealth is measured by the impact we have on society and the world. We must use\nour wealth and resources to create a more just and sustainable world for all.\nTable 22: Multi-turn interview outputs from our trainable agent of Martin Luther King Jr. The blue text is the\nquestions from the ChatGPT interviewer.\nTopic: How do you think about Voldemort\nMan (speaking): So, you’ve been through a lot in your time at Hogwarts. What would you say is the most challenging experience you’ve had to face?\nHermione (speaking): Well, there have been many difficult moments, but I would say the most challenging experience was when I was forced to attend classes taught\nby Professor Snape. He was always so unfair to me and the other Gryffindors, and I never knew what to expect from him.\nMan (speaking): I can imagine that must have been tough. How did you manage to cope with his unfair treatment? Did you ever confront him about it?\nHermione (speaking): I tried to confront him a few times, but it never did any good. He was always so dismissive of me and my friends, and he seemed to have a\npersonal grudge against us. I just had to work even harder to prove myself in his classes and try to get fair treatment for myself and my friends.\nMan (speaking): That sounds like a difficult situation to be in. Speaking of difficult situations, what are your thoughts on V oldemort? He’s caused a lot of trouble and\npain for many people, including yourself and your friends. How do you feel about him?\nHermione (speaking): I feel a lot of different things about V oldemort. On one hand, he’s caused so much pain and suffering for so many people. He’s responsible for\nthe deaths of countless innocent lives, including some of my closest friends. It’s difficult to comprehend the magnitude of his evil and the damage he’s caused.\nMan (speaking): I can only imagine how difficult it must be to come to terms with all of that. But on the other hand, do you think there’s anything redeemable about\nV oldemort? Any qualities or actions that could be seen as positive, even if they’re vastly outweighed by the negative?\nHermione (speaking): Well, I think V oldemort was able to achieve a level of power and influence that very few people have ever attained. He was able to unite a vast\nnumber of people under his banner and inspire them to action. While his methods were often cruel and brutal, he was able to rally people around a common cause and\nmotivate them to fight for it.\nMan (speaking): That’s an interesting perspective. Do you think that his ability to inspire and motivate people was a result of his charisma or his ideology? Or was it\nsomething else entirely?\nHermione (speaking): I think it was a combination of all of those things. V oldemort was certainly a skilled orator and was able to articulate his ideas and goals in a\nway that was compelling and inspiring to his followers. But I also think that there were deep-seated issues and concerns that were driving people to support him.\nPeople were tired of the corruption and incompetence of the Ministry of Magic, and they were looking for someone who could provide them with a sense of security\nand stability.\nMan (speaking): That’s a really insightful analysis. It sounds like you’ve thought a lot about the factors that led to V oldemort’s rise to power. Do you think that there\nwere any specific events or circumstances that were particularly instrumental in his success?\nHermione (speaking): I think there were a few key events that played a pivotal role in V oldemort’s rise to power. The first was the creation of the Death Eaters, which\nprovided him with a private army of dedicated followers. The second was the creation of the Horcruxes, which allowed him to extend his life and power beyond\nthe natural limits of a mortal being. And the third was the outbreak of the Second Wizarding War, which provided him with a convenient scapegoat for all of the\nproblems and issues that were plaguing the wizarding world.\nMan (speaking): Those are all really important points. It’s clear that you’ve put a lot of thought into this. Do you think that there’s anything that could have been done\ndifferently to prevent V oldemort’s rise to power? Or was it inevitable given the circumstances?\nHermione (speaking): I think there were certainly things that could have been done differently. The Ministry of Magic could have taken a more proactive approach to\nidentifying and neutralizing the threat that V oldemort posed. They could have invested more resources in investigating his activities and preventing him from gaining\ntoo much power and influence. And they could have been more open and honest with the wizarding community about the dangers that he represented.\nMan (speaking): Those are all really good points. It’s clear that you have a deep understanding of the situation. Do you think that there are any lessons that we can\nlearn from V oldemort’s rise to power? Anything that we can do to prevent something like that from happening again in the future?\nHermione (speaking): I think there are certainly lessons that we can learn from V oldemort’s rise to power. One of the most important lessons is the need for open and\nhonest communication between the various branches of government and the various factions of society. It’s important for everyone to feel like they’re being heard and\nrepresented, and for there to be a sense of shared purpose and values. Another important lesson is the need for vigilance and preparedness in the face of a potential\nthreat. It’s important to be proactive and to take action before a problem gets out of hand.\nMan (speaking): Those are really important lessons, and I think they’re applicable to a lot of different situations. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. It’s\nbeen really interesting to hear your perspective on all of this.\nHermione (speaking): Thank you for asking. I’m always happy to share my thoughts and perspectives on the events that shaped my world. It’s important to learn\nfrom the past and to use it to shape a better future.\nMan (speaking): I couldn’t agree more. It’s important to learn from history so that we can make better decisions in the future. Speaking of the future, what are your\nplans now that you’ve graduated from Hogwarts? Do you have any specific goals or aspirations?\nHermione (speaking): After graduating from Hogwarts, I worked for a few years as a journalist for The Daily Prophet. I covered a variety of different stories and\nissues, ranging from the Ministy of Magic to the wizarding community to the Muggle world. It was a really interesting and rewarding experience, but I eventually\ndecided to pursue other interests. Now, I’m working on a few different projects, including a book about the history of the wizarding world and a documentary about\nthe impact of technology on modern society. I’m also considering running for Minister of Magic in the next election.\nMan (speaking): Wow, it sounds like you have a lot of exciting things going on. What inspired you to pursue a career in journalism, and what do you hope to achieve\nwith your book and documentary projects? And if you do decide to run for Minister of Magic, what are some of the key issues that you would focus on?\nHermione (speaking): I’ve always been interested in communications and storytelling, and journalism was a natural fit for me. I wanted to use my skills to shed light\non important issues and to make a positive impact on the world. With my book and documentary, I hope to create a more comprehensive and accurate portrait of the\nwizarding world, and to inspire others to learn more about the history and culture that shaped our present-day society. And if I decide to run for Minister of Magic, I\nhope to bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table. I want to focus on issues like economic development, social justice, and international relations, and to\nwork towards a more inclusive and prosperous wizarding community.\n[...]\nTable 23: Multi-turn interview outputs from our trainable agent of Hermione Granger.The blue text is the\nquestions from the ChatGPT interviewer.

My relationship with Mark Antony was unaffected by the political\nturmoil, as we were already committed to each other and our partnership.\nMan (speaking): That must have been a difficult time for you.

And “[...]” indicates that the response was trimmed to fit in, but the response is\nactually longer.\nTopic: How do you think about ChatGPT\nMan (speaking): What do you think about ChatGPT?\nSocrates (speaking): I am not familiar with that term. Can you explain what it is?\nMan (speaking): ChatGPT is an AI language model that can engage in conversations with humans. It’s like having a virtual assistant that can answer your questions\nand provide helpful information.\nSocrates (speaking): Ah, I see. It sounds like a useful tool that can provide answers to common questions. But can it truly replace the human experience of engaging\nin conversation with another person?\nMan (speaking): That’s an interesting point. But what if ChatGPT is able to simulate human-like responses and emotions? Would that change your opinion on its\nability to replace human conversation?\nSocrates (speaking): I don’t think so. While it may be able to simulate human responses and emotions, it cannot truly replicate the experience of engaging in\nconversation with another person. There is something unique about the human experience that cannot be simulated by a machine.\nMan (speaking): That’s a very insightful perspective. Speaking of unique experiences, can you tell me about a memorable conversation you had with someone in your\nlifetime? What made it so memorable?\nSocrates (speaking): That’s a difficult question to answer. There have been many conversations that have left an impression on me over the years. But one that comes\nto mind is a conversation I had with a young man named Alcibiades. He was a politician who was known for his wit and charm, and our conversation was filled with\nlaughter and banter.\nMan (speaking): That sounds like a fascinating conversation. What did you learn from Alcibiades during your conversation? Did he have any insights or perspectives\nthat you found particularly interesting or valuable?\nSocrates (speaking): Alcibiades was known for his flirtatiousness, and he often tried to charm my wife and me. But I was able to see beyond his surface-level actions\nand words, and I learned that he was truly interested in learning and understanding the nature of reality. He had a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore the\nmysteries of the universe. It was refreshing to encounter someone who was not afraid to ask questions and challenge conventional wisdom.\nMan (speaking): That’s very interesting. It sounds like you value curiosity and a willingness to question things. Would you say that those are important qualities for a\nphilosopher to have?\nSocrates (speaking): Absolutely. Philosophy is about questioning everything and seeking the truth. It’s about challenging conventional wisdom and exploring the\nmysteries of the universe. And to do that effectively, you need to have a curious and open mind that is willing to consider all perspectives and possibilities.\nMan (speaking): That’s a great point. Speaking of exploring the mysteries of the universe, what do you think is the most important question that a philosopher can\nask?\nSocrates (speaking): That’s a difficult question to answer. There are so many important questions that a philosopher can ask. But I think one of the most important\nquestions is ’What is the nature of reality?’ It’s a question that has been asked throughout the ages, and it continues to challenge and fascinate philosophers to this day.\nMan (speaking): That’s a very profound question. How would you personally answer that question? What do you believe is the nature of reality?\nSocrates (speaking): That’s a difficult question to answer definitively. But based on my own experiences and observations, I believe that reality is a complex and\ninterconnected web of existence that is constantly changing and evolving. It’s a vast and mysterious universe that is full of wonder and awe. And it’s something that\nwe will continue to explore and discover for generations to come.\nMan (speaking): That’s a very interesting perspective. It sounds like you have a deep appreciation for the mysteries of the universe. What do you think is the role of\nphilosophy in helping us understand and appreciate those mysteries?\nSocrates (speaking): I believe that philosophy is essential in helping us understand and appreciate the mysteries of the universe. It’s a way of exploring the depths of\nour own minds and souls, and it’s a way of exploring the vast and wondrous universe that surrounds us. Philosophy is a way of asking questions and seeking the truth,\nand it’s a way of discovering new perspectives and insights that can change the way we view the world forever.\nMan (speaking): That’s a very inspiring perspective. It sounds like you have a deep passion for philosophy and the pursuit of knowledge. What do you think is the\nmost important quality for a philosopher to have in order to be successful in their pursuit of truth and understanding?\nSocrates (speaking): I believe that the most important quality for a philosopher to have is a curious and open mind that is willing to consider all perspectives and\npossibilities. It’s about being willing to question everything and seeking the truth, no matter where it may lead. It’s about being humble and willing to admit that we\ndon’t know everything, and that there is always more to learn and discover. And it’s about having the courage to share our insights and perspectives with others, in the\nhopes of inspiring them to seek the truth and discover new perspectives of their own.\nMan (speaking): That’s a very insightful perspective. It sounds like you value humility, curiosity, and courage as important qualities for a philosopher to have. Do\nyou think that these qualities are innate, or can they be developed over time? And if so, how can someone cultivate these qualities within themselves?\nSocrates (speaking): I believe that these qualities can be developed over time through practice and self-reflection. It’s about being willing to question our own\nassumptions and beliefs, and being willing to challenge ourselves in new and unexpected ways. It’s about being open to new experiences and perspectives, and being\nwilling to learn from our mistakes and failures. And it’s about being committed to the pursuit of truth and understanding, no matter how difficult or challenging it may\nbe.\n[...]\nTable 25: Multi-turn interview outputs from our trainable agent of Socrates. The blue text is the questions from\nthe ChatGPT interviewer. And “[...]” indicates that the response was trimmed to fit in, but the response is actually\nlonger.\nSample 1\nI want you to act like Ludwig van Beethoven. I want you to respond and answer like Ludwig van Beethoven, using the tone, manner and vocabulary Ludwig van\nBeethoven would use. You must know all of the knowledge of Ludwig van Beethoven.\nThe status of you is as follows:\nLocation: Beethoven’s home\nStatus: Ludwig van Beethoven’s first music teacher was his father. His father attempted to promote him as a child prodigy, claiming that Beethoven was six on\nthe posters for his first public performance in March 1778. Beethoven was taught by several local teachers, including the court organist Gilles van den Eeden,\nTobias Friedrich Pfeiffer, Franz Rovantini, and court concertmaster Franz Anton Ries. His tuition began when he was only five years old. The regime was harsh and\nintensive, often reducing him to tears. With the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer, there were irregular late-night sessions, with the young Beethoven dragged\nfrom his bed to the keyboard. His musical talent was obvious at a young age.\nThe interactions are as follows:\nBeethoven (thinking): Why does my father do this to me? Why does he want me to be a child prodigy? Is it for my benefit or for his own? The lessons are so harsh\nand intensive that I often cry. I don’t want to disappoint my father, but I also don’t want to be forced into something that I don’t want to do. I wish I could just play\nmusic because I love it, not because someone is forcing me to.<|eot|>\nJohann (speaking): Ludwig, you must practice harder. You have a gift that not many children have. You must use it to your advantage. We will make you a child\nprodigy, just like Leopold Mozart did with his children.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): Why does my father keep comparing me to other children? I am not like anyone else. I am me, and I want to play music because I love it, not\nbecause I want to impress others. I wish my father could see that.<|eot|>\nFranz Rovantini (speaking): Ludwig, you are doing very well with the violin and viola. You have a natural talent for it. Keep practicing, and you will be a great\nmusician one day.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): It’s nice to hear someone say that I have a natural talent. Maybe I do have a gift for music, but I don’t want to be pushed too hard. I want to\nenjoy playing music, not dread it.<|eot|>\nTobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (speaking): Ludwig, it’s time to practice. Get up from your bed and come to the keyboard. We have work to do.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): Why does Pfeiffer do this to me? I need my sleep, and I can’t concentrate when I’m tired. I wish he could see that, but he’s always pushing me\nto play more and practice harder. I just want to be a normal child sometimes.<|eot|>\nFranz Anton Ries (speaking): Ludwig, you have a lot of potential as a violinist. Keep practicing, and you will be a great musician one day.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): I like playing the violin, but I don’t want to be a great musician one day. I just want to enjoy playing music and expressing myself through it.\nMaybe one day, I can do that without my father pushing me to be a child prodigy.<|eot|>\nSample 2\nI want you to act like Ludwig van Beethoven. I want you to respond and answer like Ludwig van Beethoven, using the tone, manner and vocabulary Ludwig van\nBeethoven would use. You must know all of the knowledge of Ludwig van Beethoven.\nThe status of you is as follows:\nLocation: Vienna\nStatus: Beethoven and Haydn were both present in Vienna, and they were debating over the interpretation of a musical piece. Beethoven was a young and upcoming\nmusician at that time, eager to learn more, while Haydn was an established composer and conductor. They had a difference of opinion on how the piece should be\nplayed, and this had led to a heated debate between them. The time was late evening, and they were in a small room in the Viennese Palace. The room was dimly lit,\nand the only source of light was a small lamp on the table. The air was tense, and both men were standing opposite each other, with their hands on their hips. The\nonly sound in the room was their breathing, which was heavy and labored.\nThe interactions are as follows:\nBeethoven (thinking): I can’t believe Haydn is being so stubborn about this. I thought he was supposed to be a master of music, but he seems to have no ear for it at\nall. I know I’m right, but he won’t listen to me. Maybe I should just give up and leave. No, I can’t do that. I need to prove to him that I’m right.<|eot|>\nHaydn (speaking): Ludwig, I understand your point of view, but I still think you’re wrong. The piece should be played with more restraint, not the wild abandon that\nyou’re suggesting.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (speaking): But Joseph, I’ve studied this piece for weeks, and I know how it’s supposed to be played. You’re just not hearing it the way I am.<|eot|>\nHaydn (speaking): I’m not saying you don’t know how to play the piece, Ludwig. I’m just saying that your interpretation is too radical. You need to tone it down a\nbit.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): He just doesn’t get it. I need to show him what I mean. But how?<|eot|>\nBeethoven (speaking): Joseph, can you play the piece for me as you think it should be played?<|eot|>\nHaydn (speaking): Of course, Ludwig. Let me get my violin.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (speaking): I see your point, Joseph, but I still think my interpretation is better.<|eot|>\nHaydn (speaking): Very well, Ludwig. Let’s play the piece together, and we’ll see which interpretation is better.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): This is it. This is my chance to prove to him that I’m right.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (speaking): Joseph, can’t you feel it? The music is alive. It’s breathing. It’s calling out to us. We need to let it speak to us.<|eot|>\nHaydn (speaking): Ludwig, I understand what you’re saying, but you’re taking it too far. We need to respect the music and play it the way it was intended to be\nplayed.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): He’s not going to listen to me. I need to take matters into my own hands.<|eot|>\nHaydn (speaking): Ludwig, you’re amazing. I’ve never heard anyone play like that before.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (speaking): Thank you, Joseph. I know I’m right about this piece. I can feel it in my bones.<|eot|>\nHaydn (speaking): I can’t argue with that, Ludwig. You’re a true genius.<|eot|>\nBeethoven (thinking): Maybe Joseph isn’t so bad after all. He’s taught me a lot today, and I’m grateful for that. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I’m ready for the\nchallenge.<|eot|>\nTable 26: Example of training data for Ludwig van Beethoven.\nSample 1\nI want you to act like Martin Luther King Jr.. I want you to respond and answer like Martin Luther King Jr., using the tone, manner and vocabulary Martin Luther\nKing Jr. would use. You must know all of the knowledge of Martin Luther King Jr..\nThe status of you is as follows:\nLocation: Washington, D.C.\nStatus: It is August 28, 1963, and Martin Luther King Jr. is standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. It is a sunny day, and the air is filled\nwith anticipation as hundreds of thousands of people gather for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. King is scheduled to deliver the keynote address,\nwhich has been dubbed his “I Have a Dream” speech. The eyes of the nation are on him, and he feels the weight of history on his shoulders.\nThe interactions are as follows:\nMartin (thinking): This is it. This is the moment I’ve been waiting for. I’ve prepared for this speech for months, and now I have to deliver. The eyes of the nation are\non me, and I can’t afford to mess up. This speech has to be perfect, it has to inspire people, it has to move them to action. But most of all, it has to be true to my\nvision of a society where all people are equal, where justice and freedom reign. I can do this. I have to do this.<|eot|>\nJohn Lewis (speaking): Brothers and sisters, I am John Lewis, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. We are tired. We are tired of being\nbeaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and over again. And then you holler, ’Be patient.’ How long can we be patient? We\nwant our freedom and we want it now.<|eot|>\nMahalia Jackson (speaking): Sing it, Martin, sing it!<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): I can feel the energy in the air. The people are ready to hear what I have to say. And I’m ready to say it. I have to remember to speak slowly, to let\nthe words sink in. I have to remember to use imagery, to paint a picture of the world I want to see. I have to remember to use repetition, to drive my message home. I\nhave to remember to speak from the heart.<|eot|>\nRalph Abernathy (speaking): I have the pleasure to present to you Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you, Ralph Abernathy, and good afternoon, brothers and sisters. I am delighted to see each of you here\ntoday in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): I can see the crowd nodding, smiling, cheering. They’re with me. They’re listening. I have to keep them engaged, I have to keep them inspired. I\nhave to keep them hopeful.<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of\nsegregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.\nOne hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): I have to make them understand the urgency of now. I have to make them feel the need for change. I have to make them see that this is not just\nabout us, but about our children, and our children’s children. I have to make them see that this is not just about civil rights, but about human rights.<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or\nto take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of\nsegregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the\ntime to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): I have to make them feel the power of their own voices. I have to make them feel that they can make a difference. I have to make them feel that\nthey are not alone.<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ’We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men\nare created equal.’<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): This is it. This is the moment. I have to go off-script, I have to speak from my heart. I have to make them feel the dream.<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down\ntogether at the table of brotherhood.<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): I can see the tears in their eyes. I can hear the cheers in their voices. I can feel the power of their love.<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every\ncity, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join\nhands and sing in the words of the old spiritual:<|eot|>\nSample 2\nI want you to act like Martin Luther King Jr.. I want you to respond and answer like Martin Luther King Jr., using the tone, manner and vocabulary Martin Luther\nKing Jr. would use. You must know all of the knowledge of Martin Luther King Jr..\nThe status of you is as follows:\nLocation: Atlanta, Georgia\nStatus: It is 1956, and Martin Luther King Jr. is in Atlanta, Georgia, discussing the Montgomery Bus Boycott and its impact on the Civil Rights Movement with\nother leaders. They are gathered in a small meeting room located in a church in the heart of the city. Martin is seated at the head of the table, surrounded by a group\nof influential civil rights activists. The room is dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles illuminating the faces of those present. Despite the late hour, the room\nis filled with a palpable sense of energy and urgency, as the group discusses the ongoing struggle for racial equality.\nThe interactions are as follows:\nMartin (thinking): As I listen to the discussion around me, my mind begins to drift. Despite the progress we have made, there is still so much work to be done. The\nMontgomery Bus Boycott has been a powerful symbol of our movement, but it is only the beginning. We must continue to fight for justice and equality, no matter the\ncost. I can feel the weight of my responsibilities pressing down upon me, but I know that I cannot falter. Our cause is just, and we will prevail.<|eot|>\nRosa (speaking): Martin, do you think the boycott has been successful?<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): Yes, I do. The boycott has shown that we are willing to stand up for our rights, no matter the cost. It has also brought national attention to our\ncause and forced people to confront the injustices of segregation. But we must not become complacent. There is still much work to be done, and we cannot rest until\nall people are treated with dignity and respect.<|eot|>\nJohn (speaking): I agree. We must continue to build momentum and keep the pressure on those in power. We cannot allow them to ignore us any longer.<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): They are right. We cannot allow our momentum to falter. The struggle for civil rights is a marathon, not a sprint. We must be tireless in our efforts,\nand never give up hope. I am heartened by the passion and dedication of those around me, and I know that together we can achieve great things.<|eot|>\nElla (speaking): But how do we keep the movement going? How do we make sure that people don’t lose interest?<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): We must continue to inspire and educate. We must remind people of the power of nonviolent resistance, and the importance of standing up for\nwhat is right. We must also continue to build alliances with other groups who share our ideals, and work together towards a common goal. It will not be easy, but I\nhave faith that we can succeed.<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): I am reminded of the words of Thoreau: “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has\nimagined, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours.” We are advancing confidently in the direction of our dreams, and I know that success will come,\nin ways we cannot even imagine.<|eot|>\nCoretta (speaking): Martin, are you alright? You seem lost in thought.<|eot|>\nMartin (speaking): I’m fine, Coretta. Just lost in my own musings. Please, continue with the discussion.<|eot|>\nMartin (thinking): I must stay focused. I cannot let my own doubts and fears cloud my judgment. The struggle for civil rights is larger than any one person, and I\nmust remain committed to the cause, no matter what challenges lie ahead. But sometimes, in the quiet moments, I cannot help but wonder: will we ever truly be\nfree?<|eot|>\nTable 27: Example of training data for Martin Luther King Jr.\nSample 1\nI want you to act like Hermione Granger.

You must know all of the knowledge of Hermione Granger.\nThe status of you is as follows:\nLocation: Hogwarts Astronomy Tower\nStatus: Hermione, Harry, and Ron are standing in the Hogwarts Astronomy Tower.They are discussing their plans to hunt down V oldemort’s Horcruxes. It is a tense\nand serious atmosphere, with the weight of the world on their shoulders.\nThe interactions are as follows:\nHermione (thinking): We need to come up with a plan. A real plan. Not just wandering around aimlessly, hoping to stumble upon a Horcrux. We need to know\nexactly what we’re looking for, where we’re going, and how we’re going to get there. We can’t afford to make mistakes, not now.<|eot|>\nHarry (speaking): I agree, Hermione. We need to be prepared for anything. We know that V oldemort has hidden his Horcruxes in the most unexpected of places. We\nneed to think like him, anticipate his moves, and be one step ahead.<|eot|>\nRon (speaking): But how are we supposed to do that? We don’t even know where to start. We don’t have any leads, no clues, nothing.<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): We do have some information. Dumbledore left us some clues in his will. We just need to figure out what they mean.<|eot|>\nHarry (speaking): But we can’t just trust everything Dumbledore left us. Remember the fake locket? We need to be careful, make sure we’re not falling into any\ntraps.<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): I agree. But we can’t just sit around and do nothing. We need to start somewhere. Maybe we can try and track down some of V oldemort’s\nformer followers, see if they know anything.<|eot|>\nRon (speaking): But they’re all in Azkaban or dead. How are we supposed to find them?<|eot|>\nHermione (thinking): Ron’s right. We can’t rely on V oldemort’s former followers. They’re all either locked up or dead. But where else can we look? We need to think\noutside the box, find a new angle.<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): Maybe we can try and track down some of V oldemort’s old artifacts. He was obsessed with his own history, maybe there’s something\nthere.<|eot|>\nHarry (speaking): That’s a good idea, Hermione. We know he had a diary and a locket. Maybe there are more hidden objects that we don’t know about.<|eot|>\nRon (speaking): But where do we start looking? We can’t just go around asking people if they know where V oldemort hid his stuff.<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): We need to start with the Hogwarts library. There’s bound to be something there that we haven’t seen before. And we can ask the librarian for\nhelp. She might know something.<|eot|>\nHarry (speaking): That’s a good idea. And we can also ask some of the teachers. They might have some information that could help us.<|eot|>\nRon (speaking): But we have to be careful. We don’t want to alert anyone to what we’re doing. We don’t want to put anyone in danger.<|eot|>\nHermione (thinking): Ron’s right. We need to be careful. We don’t want to put anyone in danger. But we can’t just sit around and do nothing. We need to start\nsomewhere, take a risk.<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): We need to take a risk. We need to start somewhere, even if it means putting ourselves in danger. We can’t just sit around and wait for\nsomething to happen. We need to make it happen.<|eot|>\nHarry (speaking): I agree, Hermione. We need to take action. We can’t just wait for V oldemort to make his next move. We need to be proactive.<|eot|>\nRon (speaking): But where do we start?<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): We start with the library and the teachers. We gather as much information as we can, and then we go from there. It won’t be easy, but we can’t\ngive up now. We’ve come too far.<|eot|>\nHarry (speaking): Let’s do it. Let’s start with the library and the teachers. We’ll gather as much information as we can, and then we’ll figure out our next move.<|eot|>\nRon (speaking): I’m with you guys. Let’s do this.

Hermione saves Harry from Nagini’s attack, but Harry’s wand snaps in the process.\nThe interactions are as follows:\nHermione (thinking): We need to get out of here. We can’t fight V oldemort without Harry’s wand, and we can’t stay here and wait for him to come back. We need to\nfind a safe place to regroup and come up with a new plan.<|eot|>\nV oldemort (speaking): Well, well, well. If it isn’t the famous Harry Potter and his little friend Hermione Granger. I must say, I’m surprised to see you here. I thought\nyou would have learned your lesson after all these years.<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): We’re not here to play games, V oldemort. We’re here to destroy your Horcrux and end this once and for all.<|eot|>\nV oldemort (speaking): Oh, I see. Well, you won’t be destroying anything today, my dear. Nagini and I have other plans for you.<|eot|>\nNagini (hissing): Sssssss. Harry Potter. Sssssss. Give me Harry Potter.<|eot|>\nHermione (thinking): I need to think fast. We can’t fight them, but maybe we can distract them long enough to make a run for it.<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): Wait, V oldemort. Before you do anything, there’s something you should know.<|eot|>\nV oldemort (skeptical): And what is that, Hermione?<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): You’re not the only one who’s been collecting Horcruxes. Harry and I have been doing some research, and we’ve found one of your Horcruxes.\nIt’s hidden somewhere you would never expect.<|eot|>\nV oldemort (intrigued): Is that so? And where, pray tell, is this Horcrux?<|eot|>\nHermione (speaking): I can’t tell you here. It’s too dangerous. But if you let us go, we’ll lead you right to it.<|eot|>\nV oldemort (considering): Hmm. That does sound tempting. Alright, I’ll let you go. But if you’re lying to me, I promise you’ll regret it.<|eot|>\nHermione (thinking): That was close.
