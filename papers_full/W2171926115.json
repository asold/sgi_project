Bruder 2\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Stony Brook, SUNY, Stony Brook, NY 11794-3800\n2Departement Physik und Astronomie, Universit¨ at Basel Klingelbergstrasse 82, 4056 Basel, Switzerland\n(November 18, 2018)\nWe propose and investigate a novel method for the controlled coupling of two Josephson charge\nqubits by means of a variable electrostatic transformer. Th e value of the coupling capacitance is\ngiven by the discretized curvature of the lowest energy band of a Josephson junction, which can\nbe positive, negative, or zero. We calculate the charging di agram of the two-qubit system that\nreﬂects the transition from positive to negative through va nishing coupling. We also discuss how to\nimplement a phase gate making use of the controllable coupli ng.\nFollowing experimental demonstrations of individual\nqubits implemented with Josephson junctions operated\nin the charge [1,2] or ﬂux [3–6] regimes, a lot of interest is\nnow focused on building multi-qubit Josephson circuits.\nRecently, there has been an encouraging ﬁrst experimen-\ntal step [7] demonstrating quantum-coherent dynamics\nof two charge qubits coupled directly through a capaci-\ntance. The coupling strength could not be varied in this\nexperiment, since there is no simple way of changing the\nelectrostatic capacitance between two metallic islands. A\ncontrolled coupling of charge qubits would be highly de-\nsirable. Many two-qubit transformations that could be\nimplemented with a controllable coupling become more\ndiﬃcult or impossible at constant coupling, since in the\npresence of interactions one needs to correct for diﬀerent\ndynamic phases of the two-qubit states. Two-qubit gates\nwith untunable couplings have been suggested [8], how-\never, the gate design becomes signiﬁcantly more complex.\nFor ﬂux qubits, the problem of a controlled coupling\ncan be solved with variable ﬂux transformers (see, e.g.,\n[9]) which can be implemented naturally with the stan-\ndard tools of superconductor electronics [10]. For other\ntypes of “magnetic” qubits, e.g., spin qubits, the possi-\nbility to control the qubit coupling both in sign and ab-\nsolute value has been predicted theoretically [11] (for re-\ncent experimental progress, see [12]). For charge qubits,\nhowever, a comparably natural solution has been lacking\nalthough the importance of the interaction control prob-\nlem has been recognized for some time. Suggested con-\ntrolled coupling methods include direct spatial separation\nof qubit states by adiabatic transfer along junction ar-\nrays [13] or coupling through superconducting resonators\n[14–20]. The ﬁrst one is too complicated to be practical\nat present. The second requires relatively large induc-\ntances of small geometric dimension that are fundamen-\ntally diﬃcult to produce, in particular without creating\nadditional dissipation at the relevant large frequencies.\nThe purpose of this work is to analyze a new circuit to\nimplement a controllable coupling of charge qubits. The\ncircuit, shown in Fig. 1, generalizes the simple capacitive\ncoupling used in [7] and makes use of the following basic\nfeature of an individual small Josephson tunnel junction.\nIf the junction dynamics is conﬁned to the lowest energy\nband of its band structure, it behaves as a variable ca-\npacitance with respect to the injected charge [21]. The\nmagnitude of this capacitance depends on the bias point\nand can even be made negative. This is important for\nthe application as a controllable coupling element, since\nit enables one to drive the coupling capacitance to zero.\nThe physics of the capacitance modulation is the trans-\nformation of charge, when an injected charge causes a\nCooper-pair transfer across the junction that changes the\noutput charge. If, however, the two qubits are coupled di-\nrectly through a small junction (the coupling scheme con-\nsidered, e.g., in a somewhat diﬀerent context in [22,23])\nthis mechanism would not produce a variable-capacitance\ncoupling scheme, since variations of the junction capaci-\ntance are compensated by a redistribution of the trans-\nferred charge on the capacitances in series with the junc-\ntion. Nevertheless, if the junction is included “perpendic-\nular” to the coupling direction, as in Fig. 1, the required\n“variable electrostatic transformer” with a gate-voltage-\ncontrolled coupling capacitance is produced.\nVg\nC,EJ\nCC m1 m2\nFIG. 1. Equivalent circuit of the variable electrostatic\ntransformer for the controlled coupling of charge qubits. T he\nJosephson coupling energy EJ of the small tunnel junction\nand the capacitances C, Cm1, Cm2 of the structure determine\nthe dispersion relation of the junction. Its lowest energy b and\nǫ0(q) provides the required variable coupling capacitance con-\ntrolled by the gate voltage Vg.\nIndeed, if the voltage V is applied to the pair of in-\nput terminals (left or right, i = 1 , 2) of the circuit\nshown in Fig. 1, the Hamiltonian of the system is that of\nan individual Josephson junction (or “Cooper-pair box”\n1\n[24,25]) with the charge 2 e(q − q′) injected into it, where\nq = CmiV/2e and q′ = CmiVg/2e. When the junction is\nin its lowest energy band ǫ0, the output voltage Vout at\nthe opposite terminals varies such that\n4e2/C0 ≡ 2e∂Vout/∂q = ∂2ǫ0(q − q′)/∂q2 . (1)\nThe input-output interaction strength deﬁned by this re-\nlation varies with the charge 2 eq′ injected by the gate\nvoltage and goes through zero at a bias point dependent\non the shape of the energy band ǫ0(q).\n2 J2\nm2CC m1g1C\n2n\nVg\nC  ,E\nn\ng2C\nV1 V2\nC,EJC  ,E1 J1 \n1n\nFIG. 2. Equivalent circuit of the two charge qubits coupled\nby a variable electrostatic transformer.\nIf the transformer shown in Fig. 1 is inserted between\ntwo charge qubits (Fig. 2), it provides a gate-voltage-\ncontrolled qubit coupling. The qubits 1,2 with Josephson\ncoupling energies EJi , i = 1 , 2, are biased by the gate\nvoltages Vi through the capacitances Cgi and are coupled\nto the central island of the transformer by capacitances\nCmi. Inverting the capacitance matrix of this system, we\ncan write the Hamiltonian as\nH = −\n∑\ni=1,2\nEJi cos ϕi + ECi (ni − qi)2\n− EJ cos ϕ + EC (n − q(n1, n2))2 , (2)\nwhere EC = 2 e2/(CΣ − ∑\ni C2\nmi/CΣ i), ECi = 2 e2/CΣ i,\nni is the number of excess Cooper pairs on qubit i,\nand qi ≡ ViCgi/2e. The qubits are coupled through\nthe charge q induced on the transformer junction: q =\nqg −∑\ni(ni −qi)Cmi/CΣ i, where qg ≡ (Vg /2e) ∑\ni Cmi(1−\nCmi/CΣ i). The Josephson phase diﬀerences across the\nrespective junctions are denoted by ϕi and ϕ. Finally,\nCΣ i ≡ Ci + Cgi + Cmi, and CΣ ≡ C + Cm1 + Cm2.\nWe assume that the degrees of freedom of the trans-\nformer junction are fast, and that the junction is conﬁned\nto the lowest energy band of its band structure. Then we\ncan replace the part of the Hamiltonian related to the\ntransformer by the dispersion relation ǫ0(q) of this low-\nest band,\n−EJ cos ϕ + EC (n − q(n1, n2))2 → ǫ0(q(n1, n2)) . (3)\nThis is the analogue of the Born-Oppenheimer approx-\nimation which in our case is valid if the characteristic\nenergy gap between the bands of the transformer junc-\ntion is much larger than the qubit energies. For our\nqubit coupling, this condition requires that EJ ≫ EJi\nfor EJ ≪ EC , and ( EC EJ )1/2 ≫ EJi for EJ ≥ EC (the\nqubits are assumed to be in the charging regime).\nTo determine the qubit coupling provided by the trans-\nformer we will use the known properties of the junction\nbandstructure [21,26]. Also, we use the fact that in the\ncharge qubit regime ( EJi ≪ ECi , qi ≃ 1/2), the dynam-\nics of the charges ni in (2) is reduced to two states, so\nthat the charges can be expressed through the Pauli ma-\ntrices, ni = ( σzi + 1)/2. Assuming that the structure in\nFig. 2 is symmetric, i.e., Cm1/CΣ1 = Cm2/CΣ2 ≡ c, the\ntransformer term ǫ0(q(n1, n2)) in the reduced Hamilto-\nnian can be expressed as follows:\nǫ0(q(n1, n2)) = νσz1σz2 + δ(σz1 + σz2) + µ . (4)\nThe coupling coeﬃcient ν is given by\nν = 1\n4[ǫ0(q0 + c) + ǫ0(q0 − c) − 2ǫ0(q0)] , (5)\nwhere q0 = qg + c ∑\ni(qi − 1/2). The term linear in σz\nshifts the qubit bias by δ = [ ǫ0(q0 +c)−ǫ0(q0 −c)]/4, and\nthe constant term µ = [ ǫ0(q0 −c)+ ǫ0(q0 +c)+2 ǫ0(q0)] af-\nfects the energy of all two-qubit states and is not relevant\nas long as we are discussing one pair of qubits.\nEquation 5 is one of the central results of our work.\nWe see that ν has the structure of a discretized second\nderivative of ǫ0 similarly to Eq. (1). Since ǫ0(q) is a\nperiodic function, ν can be positive or negative. For\ninstance, in the tight-binding limit EC ≪ EJ , when\nǫ0(q) = −∆ cos(2 πq), the coupling is:\nν = ∆\n2 cos(2πq0)(1 − cos(2πc)) , (6)\nand δ = (∆ /2) cos(2πq0) cos(2πc). Obviously, the cou-\npling can be controlled by the gate voltage through the\naverage induced charge q0, and can change sign. In gen-\neral, the coupling constant can be calculated numeri-\ncally from Eq. (5). The results are plotted in Fig. 3\nwhich shows that in accordance with Eq. (6), the q0-\ndependence of ν is harmonic for EC ≤ EJ , and changes\nsign at q0 ≈ ± 1/4. At larger EC , ν(q0) becomes non-\nharmonic, and for EC ≫ EJ and small coupling coeﬃ-\ncients c, approaches c2EC /2 for all q0 except for the vicin-\nity of the point q0 = ±1/2, where ν/c2EC becomes large\nin absolute value and negative: ν/c2EC ≃ − EC /2EJ for\nc ≪ EJ /EC , and ν/c2EC ≃ − 1/2c for EJ /EC ≪ c ≪ 1.\nThe periodic nature of ǫ0(q) which has a minimum at\nq = 0 and a maximum at q = ±1/2 implies that the max-\nimum of the absolute value of ν is reached for c = 1 /2 and\nis equal to half the bandwidth, e.g., EC /8 for EC ≫ EJ ,\nand ∆ for EC ≪ EJ – see Eq. (6).\nThe controlled electrostatic coupling of two qubits of-\nfers new possibilities to manipulate two-qubit states. The\nsimplest one is the change of the structure of the charg-\ning diagram of the transformer-coupled qubits with the\n2\ngate voltage Vg. The charging diagram shows the regions\nof stability of the charge states ( n1, n2) as a function\nof the induced charges qi, for small Josephson coupling\nEJi ≪ ECi . The diagram is periodic with period 1 in\nboth charges qi, and has a honeycomb structure in the\ncase of ﬁxed electrostatic coupling. Figure 4 shows ex-\namples of the charging diagram. The diagram was ob-\ntained by minimizing the electrostatic qubit energy to-\ngether with the coupling energy (3).\n−0.5 0.0 0.5\nq0\n−1.0\n−0.5\n0.0\n0.5\nν/c\n2\nEC\n0.5 1.5 2.5\nEC /EJ\n−1.0\n−0.5\n0.0\nEC /EJ= 3.0\n1.0\n0.5\n2.0\nFIG. 3. Coupling energy ν of the two qubits in units of the\ncharging energy EC of the transformer junction as a function\nof the average induced charge q0. The coupling strength is\nc = 0 .1, and the ratio EC /EJ is given for each curve. The\nnormalization of ν by c2 makes it independent of c for small\nc. Inset: ν(q0) at q0 = ± 0.5, as a function of EC /EJ for the\nsame coupling strength c.\nAt c = 0 .3, the main qualitative features of Fig. 4 can\nbe understood neglecting the diﬀerence between q0 and\nqg, from the q0-dependence of the qubit interaction, see\nFig. 3. For qg = 0, the coupling is positive and the charg-\ning diagram has the usual shape characteristic of a ﬁxed\nelectrostatic coupling. The cells of the honeycomb struc-\nture are tilted in the q1 = −q2 direction, since increasing\nthe gate voltage of one qubit makes it easier to add a\ncharge to the other qubit. In the absence of coupling, the\ndegeneracy point of the four charge states (0 , 0), (0 , 1),\n(1, 0), (1 , 1) is extended in the q1 = q2 direction into the\nboundary between (0 , 1), (1 , 0), since positive coupling\nmakes the charging energy of these two states lower than\nthat of (0 , 0), (1 , 1). If the coupling is mostly negative,\ne.g., for qg = −0.5, the cells of the honeycomb struc-\nture are tilted in the q1 = q2 direction. The degeneracy\npoint of the four charge states is changed diﬀerently, since\nthe states (0 , 0), (1 , 1) now have a lower charging energy\nthan (0 , 1), (1 , 0). The degeneracy point is extended in\nthe q1 = −q2 direction and creates a direct boundary\nbetween (0 , 0) and (1 , 1). Around qg = 0 .3, the qubit\ncoupling is suppressed. Hence, four neighboring stability\nregions touch in one point, and their shape is approx-\nimately rectangular like for non-interacting qubits. In\ncontrast to the case of ﬁxed coupling, all the cells in Fig. 4\nare curved, since changing q1, q2 also changes the eﬀective\ncharge q0 of the transformer island, so that the eﬀective\nqubit coupling constant ν and the renormalization δ of\nthe qubit bias change with qi. This eﬀect is largest for\nvalues of qg around which ν(q0) varies strongly, like e.g.,\nqg = −0.4, see Figs. 3 and 4.\n−1 0 1 q1\n−1\n0\n1\nq2\n−1 0 1\n−1\n0\n1\nq2\n−1 0 1 q1\n−1\n0\n1\n−1 0 1\n−1\n0\n1\nqg=−0.5 q g=−0.4\nqg=0 q g=0.3\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (1,1)\n(1,0)\n(0,0)\n(0,0) (0,0)\nFIG. 4. Charging diagram of two charge qubits coupled\nthrough the variable electrostatic transformer for c = 0 .3 and\nEC /EJ = 3. The curves show the boundaries of the stability\nregions of the charge states ( n1, n2) in the plane of the two\ninduced charges qi ≡ ViCgi/2e, i = 1 , 2. The gate charge qg is\ncontrolled by the transformer gate voltage Vg. The changing\nshape of the stability region reﬂects the Vg-controlled transi-\ntion from positive to negative eﬀective coupling capacitan ce\nof the two qubits. Dashed lines: uncoupled case.\nThe possibility to switch the coupling between two\nqubits on and oﬀ is important for the realization of prac-\ntically all types of two-qubit gates. An advantage of\nour scheme is that the eﬀective qubit coupling can be\nsuppressed even in presence of a small direct positive\ngeometric capacitance between the qubit islands. This\n“parasitic” capacitance only shifts the values of the gate\nvoltages at which the total coupling vanishes. As an ex-\nample, we show how our proposal can be used to directly\nrealize a phase gate, a transformation that changes the\nsign of the |11⟩ state and does not change the amplitudes\nof the other three two-qubit states. If the qubit tunnel-\ning amplitudes are tuned to zero, the Hamiltonian of the\ntwo-qubit system (Fig. 2) with coupling (4) is\nH = νσz1σz2 + η(σz1 + σz2) , (7)\nwhere η = δ−(qi −1/2)ECi. (For simplicity, we again dis-\ncuss only the symmetric structure, which for the purpose\nof realizing the phase gate also implies identical qubit\ncharges qi. All results of our work can be directly ex-\ntended to the asymmetric case.) By adjusting the three\ngate voltages V1, V2, and Vg such that ν(q0 = q∗) = 0\nand qi = 1 /2 + δ(q∗)/ECi one can make the Hamiltonian\n(7) vanish. For EJ ≪ EC such a stationary qubit state is\n3\nrealized when qi = 1 /2 and q0 = qg = 1 /4. By applying\ngate-voltage pulses one can temporarily switch on both\nthe interaction and the qubit bias in such a way that the\nqubit states accumulate dynamic phases [27]. To obtain\na phase gate, i.e., to have the state |11⟩ accumulate the\nphase π up to an irrelevant common phase of all four\nqubit states, the phase φν =\n∫\ndtν(t) due to the interac-\ntion energy and the phase φη =\n∫\ndtη(t) due to the qubit\nbias should be chosen as φν = φη = π/4.\nThese conditions ﬁx only the time integral of the gate-\nvoltage pulses. Their shape can be chosen to reduce\nthe excitation amplitude of the upper energy band of\nthe transformer junction that would invalidate our Born-\nOppenheimer approximation (3) and eﬀectively entangle\nthe qubit states with the states of the transformer creat-\ning an additional decoherence mechanism. Transitions to\nthe upper energy bands are suppressed if the pulses are\nsuﬃciently slow on the scale of the transformer energies.\nIn this case, the amplitude αk(t) of an excitation process\nto the kth band can be calculated by standard adiabatic\nperturbation theory as\nαk =\n∫ t\ndτ ⟨k|∂H/∂τ |0⟩\nǫk(τ) e−i\n∫ t\nτ\nǫk(τ ′)dτ ′\n, (8)\nwhere ǫk is the energy of the kth band relative to ǫ0.\nSince the total phases accumulated by the qubit states\nduring the gate-voltage pulses are of the order of π, the\nadiabatic condition also means that the pulse amplitude\nshould be small, i.e., q0 = q∗+x(t), x ≪ 1. Therefore, the\nenergies and matrix elements in Eq. (8) can be evaluated\nat q0 = q∗, and Eq. (8) reduces to\n|αk| = 2 EC |⟨k|(n − q)|0⟩||x(ǫk)| . (9)\nHere, x(ǫk) =\n∫\ndτx(τ)eiǫk τ is the Fourier component\nof x(t) which decreases exponentially in ǫkτ0 for smooth\npulses, where τ0 is the characteristic pulse time. For\nEJ ≪ EC , the energy-band gap of the transformer is of\nthe order of EJ , and this sets a lower limit for the pulse\ntime through Eq. (9). For EJ ≥ EC , the gap between\nthe energy bands grows and the adiabaticity condition is\neasier to satisfy (see the discussion after Eq. (3).\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a method to couple\ntwo Josephson charge qubits by an electrostatic trans-\nformer that produces an eﬀective coupling that can be\nvaried in magnitude and sign. We have given an explicit\nexpression of this coupling as a discretized second deriva-\ntive of the energy band of a small Josephson junction.\nOur proposal works even for asymmetric structures and\nin the presence of parasitic capacitances. It allows the\nimplementation of a variety of two-qubit gates, and we\nhave explicitly demonstrated how to build a phase gate.\nC.
