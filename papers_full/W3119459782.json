Thus, a few German codes, such as VDE \n0126-1-1, impose that the PV panels should be disconnected \nfrom the grid within 0.3 s if the RMS value of leakage current \nexceeds 300 mA [5]. \nThe leakage current elimination issue has attracted an \nincreasing attention and has been widely explored by experts \nand scholars. Generally, the common-mode (CM) filters are \noften used to reduce the leakage current. The mechanism of CM \nfilter is to increase the impedance of CM paths. Different types \nof CM filter structures have been presented to reduce the \nleakage current [6]-[8]. The CM paths for the cascaded \ninverters are discussed in [9], and two filter-based solutions are \nprovided to cutoff the leakage current paths. Then, the leakage \ncurrent can be effectively reduced. However, the volume, \nweight and investment of the total system will increase with the \nincreasement of modules.  In order to compensate the \ninfluences of parasitic capacitors on the CM paths, the \nadditional capacitor, which connects the dc-bus midpoint and \nground, is added in [10]. Generally, the parasitic capacitors are \ndifferent and depend on the system capacity. Thus, the scope of \napplication of this method is limited. A new structure of active \nEMI filter (AEF) is proposed in [11], however, the  AEF has a \ndrawback in reliability and safety. In short,  it is difficult to \nadapt to all applications by changing the hardware method, and \nit will increase the complexity of the system. \nIt is an excellent scheme to reduce the leakage current from \nthe perspective of inverter  topology and modulation. Its \nmechanism is to separate the PV array from the grid in the \nfreewheeling period. Based on this, some active switches are \nadded to the DC or AC side as the decoupling network. For \nexample, the H5 topology in Fig. 1, the Highly Efficient \nReliable Inverter Concept (HERIC) topology in Fig. 2, and the \nH6 topology in Fig. 3 [12]-[14].  An improved H6 \ntransformer-less inverter topology is generated in [15]. Two \nadditional switches are added to the DC side to balance the \nswitching loss distribution for the high-frequency switches. \nOne of the decoupling switches can be shifted from the main \nbranch to the bypass branch, which is given in [16], to reduce \nthe conduction loss. In order to overcome the drawbacks of \nconventional H6 topologies regarding reactive power capability, \nsome improved H6-type topologies are proposed in [17], [18]. \nSome extra switches and diodes on the dc side are induced such \nas H6 dc side-1 and H6 dc side-2 [19] topologies. They are \ncalled  dc  decoupling-based  transformer-less  inverter  topologies.\nA Novel Single-Phase Five-Level \nTransformer-less Photovoltaic (PV) Inverter \nXiaonan Zhu, Student Member, IEEE, Hongliang Wang, Senior Member, IEEE, Wenyuan Zhang, \nHanzhe Wang, Xiaojun Deng and Xiumei Yue \nI\n2096-3564 © 2020 CES \n330 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nCPV\n G\nS1 S2\nS3 S4\nS5\nL1\nL2\nP\nN\nFig. 1.

H6 topology. \nUnfortunately, due to the existing of the junction capacitors of \nactive switches, the decoupling network cannot be truly \nrealized. The additional leakage current paths will be \nestablished again by the junction capacitors. Thus, the CM \nvoltage should be maintained constant by clamping it to the half \ndc-bus voltage. In accordance with this principle, some\nenhanced transformer-less inverter topologies with additional\nfreewheeling paths are presented in [20], [21]. A new solution\ncalled oH5 topology [22] is a bidirectional clamping circuit. It\nis based on the H5 topology and has an additional active switch\nthat turns on in the freewheeling mode to maintain a constant\nCM voltage. A full-bridge zero-voltage state rectifier (FB-ZVR)\ntopology is proposed [23], however it suffers from high\nconduction losses because the current flows through four\nswitches in the positive period. In [24], two unidirectional\nfreewheeling paths are added to the AC side of the full-bridge\ninverter. The branches can clamp the CM voltage at half the\ndc-bus voltage whenever the potential of the freewheeling path\nfalls or rises. By combining the MOSFETs and SiC diodes, a\nfamily of single-phase grid-tied PV inverters are proposed in\n[25]. They can achieve both the performances of high\nefficiency and high reliability. Other midpoint clamping\ntopologies such as HERIC Active [26], PN-NPC [27],\nHB-ZVR-D [28] are proposed in the literature to further reduce\nthe leakage current.

Proposed single-phase five-level inverter topology. \nthe transformer-less single-phase full-bridge topology \nsynthesis methods are proposed in [29] and [30]. \nAll the above researches focus on single-phase three-level \napplications. Unfortunately, the typical single-phase five-level \ntransformer-less topologies such as H-bridge neutral point \nclamped (HB-NPC) [31], H-bridge flying-capacitor (HB-FC) \n[32] and cascaded H-bridge (CHB) [33] suffer from the same\nserious leakage current as three-level topologies. Several\ntopologies have been proposed to deal with the leakage current\nin the five-level applications. An asymmetrical T-type\nfive-level transformer-less single-phase inverter (5L-T-AHB)\nis proposed in [34]. However, it cannot maintain a constant CM\nvoltage at the voltage zero crossing. Some cascaded five-level\ntopologies are presented in [35]-[37], they also bring other\nproblems, for example, the insulation voltage to ground of PV\npanel needs to be doubled. The common ground topologies [38],\n[39] are also better solutions. However, the negative of the\ndc-bus cannot be grounded when the inverter is connected with\nthe EMI filters. Further, it is necessary to do more in-depth\nresearch for the single-phase five-level PV inverter.\nBased on this, a single-phase five-level transformer-less PV \ninverter is proposed in this paper. The rest of the paper is \norganized as follows. Section II gives the circuit configuration \nand operating principles of the proposed inverter. Section III \ngives the modulation strategy under both active and reactive \npower conditions, and the FC voltage balance method is also \ndrawn. Section IV gives a comprehensive analysis in terms of \ndevices voltage stresses, and a comparison with some existing \ntopologies has also been provided.

The dc-bus voltage is defined as Vdc. For the \nproposed inverter, five-level voltages, which are Vdc, Vdc/2, 0, \n−Vdc/2, and −Vdc, can be obtained. Notably, in order to achieve a \nconstant CM voltage, the voltages of C1 and C2 are charged to a \nquarter of the dc-bus voltage ( Vdc/4) firstly. And then they can \nbe balanced constant by the proposed modulation strategy \nwithin one switching period. Thus, the investment cost of FCs \nmay be lower than that of conventional FC-based topologies. \nB. Operation of the Single-Phase Five-Level Inverter\nThe CM characteristic of the proposed single-phase\nfive-level transformer-less inverter is discussed in this section \nto demonstrate the reduction principle of the leakage current. \nThe PV inverters are generally equipped with a filter that is \ncomposed of a pair of symmetrical inductors. The CM voltage \nVCM is derived as (1) from the CM loop model [10], where VAN \nand VBN are bridge voltages with a reference of the negative of \nthe PV panels N. \nAN BN\nCM\n2\nV VV  (1) \nThe leakage current can be expressed as (2). \nCM\nleakage PV\ndVi C dt (2) \nwhere CPV is the parasitic capacitor between the PV panels and \nthe ground, ileakage is the leakage current. \nAccording to (2), if the CM voltage is kept constant all the \ntime, the leakage current will be reduced theoretically. In order \nto obtain the CM voltage of the inverter, the detailed equivalent \ncircuit of each switching state is provided as shown in Fig. 5. \nSeen from Fig. 5, a total of eight switching states, named from \nA to H, are obtained. The CM voltage VCM and the output \nvoltage VAB for each switching state can be deduced from each \nswitching state. \nState A: Switches S1, S2, S6, S7, S8 and S11 are on as shown in \nFig. 5(a). The potentials at points A and B are Vdc and 0, \nrespectively. Thus, VAB is +Vdc, and VCM is Vdc/2. \nState B: Switches S1, S3, S5, S7, S8 and S11 are on as shown in \nFig. 5(b). Both C1 and C2 are charged because the currents \nflowing them are the output current. The potentials of A and B \nare obtained by summing the dc-bus and FC voltages. As a \nresult, VAN is 3Vdc/4 and VBN is Vdc/4. VCM and VAB are all Vdc/2. \nState C: Switches S2, S4, S6, S8 and S11 are on as shown in Fig. \n5(c). This is a freewheeling mode. The output current is still \npositive, but the currents flowing through C1 and C2 are \nnegative. Thus, both C1 and C2 are discharged.

Modulation method for the proposed inverter. \nanalysis in [15], VAN ≈ 3Vdc/4 and VBN ≈ Vdc/4. Therefore, VCM \nand VAB are all Vdc/2. \nState D: Switches S3, S4, S5, S8 and S11 are on as shown in Fig. \n5(d). C1 and C2 are not involved in the output current path, so \nthey are not affected. According to [15], VAN = VBN ≈ Vdc/2. \nTherefore, VCM is Vdc/2 and VAB is 0. \nState E: Switches S3, S4, S5, S9 and S10 are on as shown in Fig. \n5(e). This is similar to state D. The difference is that switches S8 \nand S11 are switched to S9 and S10. So the output current is \nnegative. Finally, VAN = VBN ≈ Vdc/2, VCM is Vdc/2 and VAB is 0. \nState F: Switches S2, S4, S6, S9 and S10 are on as shown in Fig. \n5(f). The potentials of A and B are similar to that in state C. \nHowever, the potentials of A and B are swapped because of the \non-state switches S9 and S10. So VCM is Vdc/2 according to (1), \nand VAB is −Vdc/2. \nState G: Switches S1, S3, S5, S7, S9 and S10 are on as shown in \nFig. 5(g). Obviously, VAN is Vdc/4 and VBN is 3Vdc/4. So VCM is \nVdc/2 and VAB is − Vdc/2. Both C1 and C2 are charged by the \noutput current. \nState H: Switches S1, S2, S6, S7, S9 and S10 are on as shown in \nFig. 5(h). VAN is 0, VBN is Vdc. So VCM is Vdc/2 and VAB is −Vdc. \nThe aforementioned analysis indicates that the CM voltage \nin each state is maintained at Vdc/2 and does not exhibit any \nhigh frequency component. The leakage current will be \npractically reduced. The bridge voltages, output voltage, and \nCM voltage are summarized in Table I. In Table I, the bridge \nvoltage levels Vdc, 3Vdc/4, Vdc/2, Vdc/4, and 0 are defined as 4, 3, \n2, 1 and 0, respectively. The output current is defined as iout. As \nshown in the table, three pairs of redundant switching states \ngenerate the same output voltage level: states B and C are \nredundant switching states to generate +2 voltage level; (D, E) \nand (F, G) are redundant switching states to generate 0 and −2, \nrespectively. However, the effect of different redundant \nswitching states on the FCs is opposite due to the different \ndirections of the charging current. It leads to the possibility of \nregulating the FCs voltage to a constant value. \nZHU et al. : A NOVEL SINGLE-PHASE FIVE-LEVEL TRANSFORMER-LESS PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) INVERTER 333\nTABLE III \nCOMPARISON WITH EXISTING TOPOLOGIES \nNo. of switch No. of diodes No. of dc capacitor No. of dc \nsource \nVoltage \nlevels \nConstant \nCMV Vdc Vdc/2 V dc/4 Vdc V dc/2 Vdc/4 Vdc Vdc/2 Vdc/4 \nPro. 4 1 6 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 5 Yes \nHB-NPC 0 8 0 0 4 0 0 2 0 1 5 No \nHB-FC 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 5 No \n5L-T-AHB [34] 4 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 1 5 No \nCascaded-H5 [35] 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 5 Yes \nCommon Ground [38] 2 4 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 1 5 Yes \nH5 [12] 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 3 Yes \nHERIC [13] 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 3 Yes \nH6 [14] 4 2 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 3 Yes \nIII. M ODULATION STRATEGY\nThe modulation method for the proposed inverter under both \nactive and reactive operations is shown in Fig. 6. The red line \nrepresents the reference uref. uc1, uc2, uc3 and uc4 are four carriers. \nThe output current iout, which is represented by the blue line, \nlags behind uref with a phase angle θ. \nSeen from Fig. 6, the full period of uref is divided into four \nzones based on the polarities of uref and iout. When uref and iout \nare in opposite direction, they are identified as reactive power \nzones such as Z1 and Z3. When  u ref and iout are in the same \ndirection, they are identified as active power zones such as Z2 \nand Z4. In each region, the selection of switch state should be \nbased on the principle of keeping capacitor voltage balance. \nThe selection of switch state will be described in detail below. \nDuring zone Z1, VAB switches between the two adjacent \nvoltage levels of +2 and 0. +2 voltage level is generated by \nswitching states B and C, and 0 voltage level is generated by \nswitching state D. Because switching states B and C have \nopposite effect on the FCs voltages, they are assigned on both \nsides of the switching state 0, then the switching sequence  \n(BCBD) is obtained. In addition, all these switching states can \nprovide bidirectional current path, that is to say the selection of \nswitching sequence only depends on the output voltage level \nand has nothing to do with the direction of output current, \nwhich makes it easier to implement. \nDuring zone Z2, the output current is positive. The selection \nprinciple of switching sequence is the same as that during zone \nZ1 when the output voltage is switched within +2 and 0 voltage \nlevels. When the output voltage is switched within +4 and +2 \nvoltage levels, the switching state A is used to generate +4 \nvoltage level, and it has no influence on the FCs voltages. \nSwitching states B and C are also used to generate +2 voltage \nlevel. In this way, the FCs voltages can also be balanced within \nthe switching frequency. \nDuring zone Z3, the output current is positive, but the output \nvoltage is negative. Similarly, −2 voltage level is generated by \ntwo redundant switching states F and G, so as to balance the \nFCs voltages. 0 voltage level is generated by switching state E. \nThus, the switching sequence (EFEG) is acquired in zone Z3. \nDuring zone Z4, both the output voltage and current are \nnegative. Two redundant switching states F and G are used to \nbalance the FC voltage and switching state H is used to generate \n+4 voltage level. Finally, the switching state rotates in the\nsequence of (FHGH).\nBy the selection of the redundant switching states, the \nvoltages of two FCs can be balanced at Vdc/4 at the switching \nfrequency. In addition, the voltage stresses of two FCs are only \nVdc/4, which will lead to a reduction in system cost and volume. \nThe equivalent switching frequency of the output voltage VAB is \ntwice the actual switching frequency because of the phase shift \nbetween the carriers. As a result, the size and cost of the filter \ncan be very small. In general, the investment in passive \ncomponents of the proposed topology is relatively small. \nIV. C OMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\nA. Voltage Stress on Switching Devices\nThe voltage stress and switching frequency for all switches\nare listed in Table II. Four switches S2, S3, S5 and S6 are clamped \nby two FCs. So the voltage stresses of them are all Vdc/4. The \nvoltage stress of S4 can be obtained from switching state B as \nshown in Fig. 5(b), and the voltage stresses of S1 and S7 can be \nobtained from switching state C as shown in Fig. 5(c). The last \nfour switches need withstand the whole dc-bus voltage as \nshown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(h). \nIn addition, seven switches (S1−S7) are turned on or off at the \nswitching frequency (fs), while four switches (S8−S11) are at the \npower line frequency ( fL). In order to reduce the total system \ninvestment, MOSFETs can be selected for S1−S7 and IGBTs are \nselected for S8−S11 in actual application. \nTABLE II \nVOLTAGE STRESS AND SWITCHING FREQUENCY OF DEVICES \nDevice Voltage Stress Switching Frequency \nS1, S2, S3, S5, S6, S7 Vdc/4 fs \nS4 Vdc/2 fs \nS8, S9, S10, S11 Vdc fL \nB. Comparison with Existing Topologies\nTable III presents a comparison of several key features of the\nproposed topology with some existing topologies. These \ntopologies include conventional H-bridge inverters, cascaded \ninverters and common ground inverters. The number of active \nand passive components, voltage stress, required dc source and \nCM voltage (CMV) are concisely shown here for comparison. \nCompared with conventional single-phase five-level \ntopologies such as HB-NPC, HB-FC and 5L-T-AHB, the \ninvestment cost of switches may be higher. However, the CMV \nof the proposed topology is clamped at Vdc/2, achieving low \nleakage current. Thus, the isolation transformer and EMI filters \n334 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nController BoardDC Power\nAuxiliary Power\nLoad\nPower Circuit Filter Inductor\nOscilloscope\nFig. 7.

Compared with common \nground topology, the investment cost of passive element is low. \nThis is because the FCs in common ground topology can only \nbe balanced at power frequency, so large  capacitance is \nrequired, the power density is also reduced. Moreover, the \nvoltage stress of FCs in the proposed topology is 1/4 of that in \ncommon ground topology, thus the power density can be \nfurther improved. Compared with the well-known H5, HERIC \nand H6 topologies, the proposed five-level inverter provides \nbetter waveform quality. \nV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed inverter , \nboth the simulations and experimental tests are carried out. \nThe simulations are done with the MATLAB software. \nThe hardware prototype is depicted in Fig. 7.

The THDs of the \noutput currents all below 2%, and the leakage currents are still \nabout 7.06 mA.

When the filter inductance has \n10% error, the leakage current waveform is shown in Fig. 9(a). \nThe RMS value of leakage current is about 17.54 mA, which is \ntwice of that under symmetrical filter inductance. Fig. 9(b) \nshows the waveforms of leakage current when the filter \ninductance has 20% error. It is observed that the RMS value of \nleakage current is about 39.62 mA. As the error in filter \ninductance increases, the leakage current increases as well.  \nZHU et al. : A NOVEL SINGLE-PHASE FIVE-LEVEL TRANSFORMER-LESS PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) INVERTER 335\nCascaded-H5HB-FC Proposed\n98.2\n98.0\n97.8\n97.6\n97.4\n97.2\n97.0\n96.8\n98.4\n0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9\nEfficiency/%\nPower/kW\n1.1\nHB-NPC\n \nFig. 10.

These topologies include HB-NPC, \nHB-FC, cascaded-H5 and the proposed inverter. It can be \nobserved that the efficiency of the proposed topology is lower \nthan HB-FC topology but higher than other topologies within \nthe full power range when the switching frequency is 10 kHz. \nAs shown in Fig. 11, when the switching frequency is low, the \nefficiency is lower than HB-FC topology, but higher than other \ntopologies. As the switching frequency increases, the efficiency \nof the proposed inverter is highest among four topologies. This \nis because the low voltage stress devices contribute to low \nswitching losses. \nB. Experimental Tests \nFig. 12 provides the DM performance of the proposed \ninverter under unite power factor. From top to bottom are the \nbridge voltage VAB, output voltage  Vout and output current  iout. \nAs can be seen, the RMS value of Vout is 220 V, and the iout is \nabout 4.6 A. The THD of iout is only 1.45%. Fig. 13 shows the \nbridge voltage VAB and FCs voltages VC1 and VC2. Obviously, the \nFCs voltages are well stabilized at 90 V with little ripples. In \nactually applications, the volume and investment cost will be \ngreatly decreased due to the low voltage stress.  \nFig. 14 shows the CM characteristics of the proposed inverter. \nFrom top to bottom are bridge voltage VAN, CM voltage VCM, \nbridge voltage VBN and the leakage current ileakage.

Waveforms of VAN, VBN and VCM in the negative half cycle. \nbridge voltages have five voltage steps, namely, 0, 90, 180, 270, \nand 360 V. Moreover, VCM is almost constant within the entire \nperiod of the utility grid with little power frequency fluctuation. \nThe detail waveform for VAN, VBN, and VCM are shown in Figs. \n15 and 16. In the positive half line period, as shown in Fig. 15, \nVBN is 90 V when VAN is 270 V; VBN is 180 V when VAN is 180 V. \nAs a result, the voltage of VCM is always maintained at 180 V. \nSimilarly, in the negative half line period, as shown in Figs. 16, \nthe voltage of VCM is also kept at 180 V. Evidently, the \nexperimental results agree closely with the results from \ntheoretical analysis. The RMS value of leakage current is only \nabout 27 mA, which complies with the VDE0126-1-1 standard. \n336 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nVAB[250V/div]  VC1[250V/div]  \niou t[5A/div]  θ=35°\n \nFig. 17.

It can be seen that the FCs voltages VC1, \nVC2 and the output voltage VAB remains stable. What’s more, the \ncurrent change is also very smooth. Therefore, the proposed \ntopology has good dynamic response performance. \nFig. 19 shows the losses ratio of each switch, the results come \nfrom the simulation by PLECS. It can be seen that the losses \nmainly concentrated in S1, S2, S6, S7 and S8-S11. The total losses \nof the last three switches S3-S5 accounts for only 5.2%.

The difference from the traditional FC-based \ntopologies is that the FCs voltages are controlled at Vdc/4. \nThrough the combination of dc-bus voltage and FCs voltages, \nthe CM voltage is theoretically maintained at a constant value \nduring the whole power frequency of unite grid, and then the \nleakage current is reduced. The two FCs voltages can be \nbalanced at Vdc/4 automatically at the switching frequency \nthrough the selection of the redundant switching states. Finally, \nthe volume and investment cost of the FCs are decreased. The \ntheoretical analysis and experimental verifications are \npresented. In conclusion, the proposed topology and \nmodulation strategy can ensure a constant CM voltage without \nany high-frequency components throughout the power \nfrequency cycle. Consequently, the leakage current can be \nsignificantly reduced below 300 mA, which meets the \nspecification in the standard VDE-0126-1-1. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M. Pahlevani, S. Eren, J. M.
