Recently, DA\nacross graphs has been beginning to draw much attention [11, 12, 16,\n19]. It aims to transfer the knowledge learned from a source network\nto a target network by learning label-discriminative and network-\ninvariant node embeddings. However, existing methods mainly\nfocus on the problem of homogeneous networks. In this paper,\nwe study a generalized domain adaptation across Heterogeneous\nInformation Networks (HINs), where nodes are fully labeled in the\nsource network while completely unlabeled in the target network.\nWe intend to minimize the domain shift and transfer the model\ntrained on the source network to the target network.\nHowever, this objective faces several challenges: 1) First, each\nHIN is composed of multiple different types of nodes and edges.\nFor example, the source network DBLP [ 5] in Fig. 1(a) contains\nfour types of nodes: papers (P), authors (A), venues (V), and terms\n(T), as well as different types of edges between them. This means\nthat different types of nodes and edges are in different semantic\nspaces and have different data distributions, which results in three\ndiscrepancies between pairwise node-type distributions (See Fig. 1\n(a.top)). 2) Second, the node and edge types in two heterogeneous\narXiv:2012.05688v3  [cs.LG]  25 Sep 2022\nCIKM ’22, October 17–21, 2022, Atlanta, GA, USA. Tiancheng Huang, Ke Xu, and Donglin Wang\nnetworks are not identical in general. For instance, DBLP and MAG\n[13] citation networks have some private-type nodes and edges\nin their networks (i.e., term nodes for DBLP, and field (F) nodes\nfor MAG). Because private node types exist across the networks\n(See Fig. 1 (a.bottom)), a common semantic space needs to be built\nbefore they are aligned to capitalize on the information about such\ntype nodes. For topological structures from two different domains,\nthere is a discrepancy to be aligned for the center node embedding\neven after all distributions of node types have been aligned (See\nFig. 1 (b)). However, previous work [18] only aligns the shared type\nnode features but ignores that each network has its characteristics.\nTo address these problems, we propose a Generalized Domain\nAdaptive model across HINs (GDA-HIN). Several independent dis-\ncriminators are used to align the embeddings in different semantic\nspaces. Specifically, our model firstly constructs auto-encoders and\ndomain discriminators to align the node features. Secondly, we\nalign the topological structure in graph embedding space using an\nautomatically learned meta-path feature extractor (e.g., HGT [4])\nand a domain discriminator. A low-rank matrix completion method\nis adopted to handle private node types. Our model combines the\nlow-rank matrix completion method with the heterogeneity of HIN.\nIn this way, GDA-HIN can get rid of the precondition of matrix\ncompletion method, that corresponding instances [ 17], or a few\nlabeled target domain data [8]. The contributions of this work:\n1) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate\nthe generalized domain adaptation across HINs that contain both\nshare and private node types. Thus, it is a more general situation\non source and target HINs for real-world scenarios.\n2) We systematically analyze the challenges of DA across HINs.\nBased on the above analyses, we propose a novel GDA-HIN by de-\nsigning pairwise node-type distribution alignment and topological\nstructure alignment to accomplish DA across HINs.\n3) We conduct extensive experiments on the three citation net-\nworks and six groups of cross-network tasks for node classification\nto evaluate the performance of domain adaptation. The experiments\nshow that GDA-HIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n2 METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Problem Definition\nGiven a fully-labeled source 𝐻𝐼𝑁𝑆 =\n\u0010\nV𝑙\n𝑆,E𝑆,A𝑆,R𝑆\n\u0011\nand a fully-\nunlabeled target 𝐻𝐼𝑁𝑇 =\n\u0010\nV𝑢\n𝑇,E𝑇,A𝑇,R𝑇\n\u0011\n, where Vand Eare\nnode and edge set, Aand Rdenote the sets of node and edge types.\nA𝑆 and A𝑇 not only share same node types but also have their\nown private node types, also leading to the difference between R𝑆\nand R𝑇. V𝑙\n𝑆 represents a set of labeled nodes while V𝑢\n𝑇 represents\na set of unlabeled nodes. The transferable classification aims to\npredict the label on 𝐻𝐼𝑁𝑇 with label information from 𝐻𝐼𝑁𝑆.\n2.2 Pairwise Node-type Distribution Alignment\nTo align each semantic component independently between source\nand target domains, we construct pairwise node-type auto-encoders\nand domain discriminators before aggregation and updating:\n1) Shared Node-type Distribution Alignment: Assuming there\nare 𝐾1 shared node-type pairs between source and target domains,\nthe pairwise node-type auto-encoder 𝐴𝐸𝑘1,𝑘1 = 1,...,𝐾 1 is used\nto encode and decode the node features of 𝑘1-th-type nodes. A\nreconstruction loss is used to constrain 𝐴𝐸𝑘1 ’s projection retaining\nsemantic information:\nLrecon1 =\n∑︁\n𝑀𝑆𝐸\n\u0010\nX𝑘1,^X𝑘1\n\u0011\n, (1)\nwhere X𝑘1 is the node feature of the 𝑘1-th shared node type for\nboth domains, ^X𝑘1 is the corresponding reconstructed feature, and\n𝑀𝑆𝐸 represents the mean square error. Then, we construct a pair-\nwise node-type domain discriminator following with a Gradient\nReversal Layer (GRL) [3] for the features of individual-type nodes\nseparately. By minimizing the domain adversarial similarity loss,\nthe encoder is trained to make similar its output processed from\nboth domains while the domain discriminator learns to identify the\ndomain of the encoder’s output. The domain discriminator loss for\nall discriminators 𝐷𝑘1 and auto-encoders 𝐴𝐸𝑘1, is formulated as:\nL𝑛𝑑𝑎1 =\n∑︁\nE𝑥∈X𝑘1\n𝑆\nh\nlog\n\u0010\n1 −𝐷𝑘1\n\u0010\n𝐴𝐸𝑘1 (𝑥)\n\u0011\u0011i\n+E𝑥∈X𝑘1\n𝑇\nh\nlog𝐷𝑘1\n\u0010\n𝐴𝐸𝑘1 (𝑥)\n\u0011i\n, (2)\nwhere 𝐷𝑘1 is the discriminator for the 𝑘1-th-type nodes.\n2) Private Node-type Distribution Alignment: Unlike shared-\nnode types, private-node types contain many unknown values.\nReconstruction constraints applied to private-node types recover\nnot only the observed values but also unknown parts. Meanwhile,\nthe private-node types like term and field are semantically rele-\nvant [10], which makes the unobserved type’s embedding contain\nplenty of linear dependent columns. Hence, the problem of recovery\nunobserved type’s embedding turns into a low-rank matrix com-\npletion problem, which can be formulated to minimize the nuclear\nnorm under the constraint of reconstruction loss [1]. For private\nnode-type pairs, we recover the missing value and get a matrix ^W:\nW =\n\u0014 X𝑆 0\n0 X 𝑇\n\u0015\n𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟\n=⇒ ^W =\n\u0014 ^X𝑆 ^U𝑆\n^U𝑇 ^X𝑇\n\u0015\n. (3)\nIn ^W above, ^X𝑆 and ^X𝑇 represent the recovered observed el-\nements, while ^U𝑆 and ^U𝑇 represent the recovered unobserved\nelements. To recover ^W, we minimize the loss Lrecon2:\nLrecon2 =\n∑︁\n𝑀𝑆𝐸\n\u0010\nX𝑘2,^X𝑘2\n\u0011\n+𝛿R\n\u0010\n^W\n\u0011\n, (4)\nwhere X𝑘2 is the node feature of the 𝑘2-th private node type, ^X𝑘2\nis corresponding observed part of recovered embedding, 𝐾2 is the\nnumber of the private-type pairs. R(^W)is a regularization term,\nwhere R(∗)denotes nuclear norm operation, and 𝛿 > 0 is a trade-\noff parameter. Under the reconstruction constraint, the encoder’s\noutput can retain enough semantic information for the private-type\npairs. The loss of discriminators for 𝑘1 shared- and 𝑘2 private-type\npairs is L𝑛𝑑𝑎 = L𝑛𝑑𝑎1 +L𝑛𝑑𝑎2, where L𝑛𝑑𝑎2 is similar as Eq. (2).\n2.3 Topological Structure Alignment\nIn this subsection, we further elaborate on how to align the topo-\nlogical structure of source and target networks.\nRepresentation of h-hop: We choose the advanced HIN model\nHGT [4] as feature extractor 𝐺, which can learn embeddings of\nh-hop structure ({N1\n(𝑣),..., Nℎ\n(𝑣)}), that is h-hop embedding, to cap-\nture network topology information.

See more details in Methodology (§2).\nsource and target networks are encoded via a feature extractor\nwith shared learnable parameters. However, there are stillh-hop\nstructure discrepancies between both domains. Then, we adopt the\ndomain alignment on the output of HGT, which aligns the data\ndistribution in the embedding space of h-hop structure.\nTopological Domain Discriminator: After extracting each nodes’\nh-hop structure embedding by feature extractor𝐺, which is a 2-layer\nHGT, another domain adversarial discriminator𝐷𝑡𝑝 is implemented\nto minimize the topological structure discrepancy, and its loss L𝑑𝑎\ndefined as:\nL𝑑𝑎 = E𝑥∈𝑯𝑺\n\u0002\nlog \u00001 −𝐷𝑡𝑝 (𝐺(𝑥))\u0001\u0003\n(5)\n+E𝑥∈𝑯𝑻\n\u0002\nlog𝐷𝑡𝑝 (𝐺(𝑥))\n\u0003\n,\nwhere H𝑆 and H𝑇 represent the outputs of encoders in source and\ntarget domains, respectively.\nDomain-invariant Classifier: The classifier 𝐶 is used to to pre-\ndict the label, and its loss L𝑐𝑙𝑠 is defined as:\nL𝑐𝑙𝑠 = −1\n𝑁𝑙\n𝑁𝑙\nΣ\n𝑖=0\n𝑌𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑔\n\u0010\n^𝑌𝑖\n\u0011\n+𝜁𝑡𝑟 \u0000H⊤LgH\u0001 , (6)\nwhere 𝜁 is a balance parameter, 𝑁𝑙 represents the number of la-\nbeled source- and target-domain nodes, and ^𝑌𝑖 denotes the 𝑖-th\nnode’s prediction. The regularization term in Eq.(6) is defined as\n𝑡𝑟(H⊤LgH), where H represents the hidden state of auto-encoders\nfor all private-type nodes and Lg denotes the graph Laplacian ma-\ntrix for all private-type nodes. In particular, the graph Laplacian\nmatrix is formulated as Lg =\n\u0012LS 0\n0 L T\n\u0013\n, where LS and LT are\nthe Laplacian matrices of source and target domains computed\naccording to the adjacency matrices. In the matrix completion mod-\nule, there are unobserved elements involved in the computation\nof private-type nodes’ embeddings, which are not constrained by\nreconstruction loss. We utilize graph Laplacian matrix to smooth\ntheir embedding over the graph, relying on the assumption that\nconnected nodes in the graph are likely to share the same label [6].\n2.4 Optimization\nPhase I Training: To minimize the nuclear norm under the con-\nstraint of reconstruction loss Eq.(4), GDA-HIN trains a Phase I\nTraining model on the shared node types of two networks to yeild\npseudo labels, and the overall objective function is composed of the\nfollowing four components:\nL𝑝1 = L𝑐𝑙𝑠 +𝛼L𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛1 +𝛽L𝑛𝑑𝑎1 +𝛾L𝑑𝑎, (7)\nwhere 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝛾 are hyper-parameters.\nWhen there are only shared node types, Eq.(6) degenerates to\ncross-entropy loss, L𝑐𝑙𝑠 = −1\n𝑁𝑆 Σ𝑁𝑆\n𝑖=0 𝑌𝑖\n𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑔\n\u0010\n^𝑌𝑖\n𝑆\n\u0011\n,where 𝑁𝑆 denotes\nthe number of source-domain nodes.\nPhase II Training: For phase II training, we select some predic-\ntions by Phase I Training model as pseudo labels for nodes in target\ndomain. Under the previous phase’s guidance, GDA-HIN considers\nboth shared- and private- node types from two networks, and the\noverall optimization objective is:\nL𝑝2 = L𝑐𝑙𝑠 +𝛼(L𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛1 +L𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛2)+𝛽L𝑛𝑑𝑎 +𝛾L𝑑𝑎.

We extract a subset of DBLP which contains\n14,328 papers (P), 4,057 authors (A), 20 venues (V), 2,517 terms (T),\nand the edges between nodes. Aminer [14]. We extract a subset\nof Aminer by selecting papers published from the year 2004 to\n2008, which contains 7,212 papers, 4,696 authors, 16 venues, 7,323\nkeywords (K), and the edges between nodes.

We categorize authors\naccording to their research areas: Database, Data Mining , Artificial\nIntelligence, and Information Retrieval . Summary statistics of the\ndatasets are displayed in Table 1.\nBaselines. We compare with the following baselines: GCN+GRL.\nThe model adopts homogeneous graph-based methods GCN [6] as\nfeature extractors and take GRL [3] as domain adaptation frame-\nwork. UDA-GCN. The method [16] adopts a multi-channel GCN\nwith a weight sharing strategy and takes GRL as the domain adap-\ntation framework. It effectively maintains local consistency and\nglobal consistency of the graphs. HAN+GRL. This model adopts\nHIN-based method HAN [15] as feature extractor, and takes GRL\nas the domain adaptation framework.\n3.2 Performance Comparison\nOur model carries out six groups of cross-network tasks, and the\nnode classification results are reported in Table 2. We have the\nfollowing primary observations: (1) Compared with all baselines,\nthe proposed GDA-HIN generally achieves the best performance.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness of GDA-HIN. (2) All HIN-\nbased methods exhibit better performance than homogeneous meth-\nods (i.e., GDA-HIN vs. GCN+GRL). This result reveals that consid-\nering heterogeneity helps the DA. In essence, it validates that for\nthe domain adaptation problem of HINs, it is essential to handle\nthe heterogeneity-caused multiple semantic spaces. (3) The GDA-\nHIN outperforms other heterogeneous graph-based methods, which\ndemonstrates that our method can better address the discrepancies\nof both pairwise node-type distributions and topological structure.\n3.3 Ablation Study\nTo gain insights about GDA-HIN, we study its variants: GDA-\nHIN𝑤/𝑜 𝑃, GDA-HIN𝑤/𝑜𝑇 and GDA-HIN𝑤/𝑆. Specifically, GDA-\nHIN𝑤/𝑜 𝑃& GDA-HIN𝑤/𝑜𝑇 are two variants of GDA-HIN with\nthe pairwise node-type distribution alignment and the topological\n(a) HGT ( 𝑤/𝑜DA)\n (b) GDA-HIN\nFigure 3: The visualization: the data points of source and tar-\nget domains are colored by red and blue color, respectively.\nstructure alignment removed, respectively. GDA-HIN𝑤/𝑆 is only\nuses shared node types for phase I training , and without using\nprivate node types, to verify the effectiveness of private node types.\nFrom Table 2, we observe that GDA-HIN is better than GDA-\nHIN𝑤/𝑜 𝑃, demonstrating the effectiveness of the pairwise node-\ntype distribution alignment for domain shift. Similarly, it is observed\nthat GDA-HIN outperforms GDA-HIN𝑤/𝑜𝑇 , verifying the effective-\nness of the topological structure alignment. Moreover, GDA-HIN\noutperforms GDA-HIN𝑤/𝑆 on all cross-domain tasks, indicating\nthe effectiveness of considering private types in domain alignment.\nNote that GDA-HIN𝑤/𝑆 outperforms other baselines, it indicates\nour model only using share- node types gains competitive results.\nIn summary, GDA-HIN outperforms three variants, indicating that\npairwise node-type alignment, which includes shared and private\nalignments, and topological structure alignment are indispensable.\n3.4 Visualization\nDue to the space limit, we report the t-SNE visualization of models’\nembeddings on Aminer→DBLP as an illustration. The results are\nshown in Fig. 3, where the source and target domains are colored\naccording to their own domains. From Fig. 3 (a) ∼(b), we can\nfind that the result of (a) HGT contains a tremendous distribution\ndiscrepancy due to 𝑤/𝑜 DA. Apparently, the visualization of our\n(b) GDA-HIN performs best, where data points of source and target\ndomains are evenly mixed and hardly separated, which means that\nthe domain shift has been successfully minimized, and the node\nembeddings learned by GDA-HIN are actually domain-invariant.\nThe domain-invariant representations are beneficial to transferring\nfrom source domain to target domain.\n4 CONCLUSION\nIn GDA-HIN, we achieve a better domain adaptation performance\nby jointly considering the pairwise node-type distribution align-\nment and topology structure alignment. We adopt the matrix com-\npletion method to effectively deal with private-type nodes by pro-\njecting each private-type pair into a new common feature space.\nThe proposed scheme has been proven effective by experiments.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by NSFC General Program (Grant No.\n62176215), and National Science and Technology Innovation 2030 -\nMajor Project (Grant No. 2022ZD0208800).\nGDA-HIN: A Generalized Domain Adaptive Model across Heterogeneous Information Networks CIKM ’22, October 17–21, 2022, Atlanta, GA, USA.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Emmanuel J Candès and Benjamin Recht. 2009.
