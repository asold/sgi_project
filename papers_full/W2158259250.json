S. Masoum, Senior Member, IEEE, Paul S. Moses, and Amir S. Masoum , Student Member, IEEE\nAbstract— A new analysis into the steady-state operation and\nderating of three-phase transformers under nonsinusoidal and\nasymmetric operating conditions is proposed. The combined\neffects of transformer core and load asymmetry, nonlinearity, and\nharmonics, as well as nonsinusoidal input excitation are exam-\nined. A time-domain nonlinear model for three-phase three-leg\ntransformers is implemented. Transformer derating is estimated\nby modeling additional power losses due to harmonics generated\nby the iron core, nonsinusoidal excitation, and nonlinear (rectiﬁer\nand electric drive) loading. Laboratory tests are performed to\nverify simulated waveforms. The contribution of this paper is a\nnonlinear transformer modeling technique for steady-state opera-\ntion under unbalanced, asymmetric, and nonsinusoidal operation,\ncapable of computing derating factors.\nIndex Terms—Asymmetry, derating, electric drives, harmonics,\nnonlinear loads, transformer losses.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nP\nROPAGATION and generation of voltage and current har-\nmonics in three-phase transformers has received consid-\nerable attention in literature. Much is known about transformer\nadditional losses being symptomatic of nonsinusoidal operation,\nleading to thermal damage in the insulation, iron core, and wind-\nings [1]–[7]. However, past analyses have been mainly limited\nto balanced and symmetric operation of transformers.\nThe majority of transformer harmonic models assume sym-\nmetrical conditions. This is seldom true as transformers often\noperate in the presence of power system and load imbalances\nwith asymmetry in the iron core. The complete extent of symp-\ntoms from unbalanced, asymmetric behavior, and nonsinusoidal\noperation is not so apparent in literature and limited documents\nhave investigated such nonlinearities [8]–[14].\nA signiﬁcant step forward was the development of the non-\nlinear three-phase magnetic circuit model by Fuchs et al. [9],\n[10] that was later modiﬁed by Pedraet al. [15] to include asym-\nmetric nonlinear core reluctances. Clua et al. [8] investigated\nunbalanced harmonic power ﬂow in three-phase transformers\nby using admittance matrices and sequence component equiva-\nlent models. However, this model neglects core nonlinearity and\nManuscript received July 6, 2007; revised December 4, 2007. First published\nMay 16, 2008; current version published September 24, 2008.

[14]. The trans-\nformer model is similar to the one implemented in this paper.\nPrevious work by Medina et al. [12], [13] derived a Norton\nharmonic representation of three-phase transformers. This\nfrequency domain technique pioneered modeling asymmetrical\ncore magnetization, harmonic cross coupling in the limbs, and\nharmonic power ﬂow.\nA simple and effective approach for the safe operation of\ntransformers is to derate them under nonsinusoidal operating\nconditions. Derating is the intentional reduction in load capacity\nof a transformer under nonsinusoidal operation [16], [17]. It be-\ncomes necessary because nonsinusoidal operation gives rise to\nadditional fundamental and harmonic losses which may pro-\nduce excessive heating. Four general techniques are used to\nestimate the derating of transformers; K-Factor, harmonic loss\nfactor\n[2], [3], [16], [17], measured harmonic losses [1],\n[19], and computed harmonics losses [5]. The last approach will\nbe used in this paper. Under nonsinusoidal operating conditions,\nthe derated fundamental load current is computed such that total\nlosses are equal to rated transformer losses. A similar method\nhas been previously demonstrated by Masoum et al. [5].\nIn this paper, a nonlinear transformer model [15] is modiﬁed\nto include nonsinusoidal excitation, (non)linear and asymmetric\nloads, transformer core nonlinearity, core asymmetry and har-\nmonic cross coupling effects in the legs. The developed trans-\nformer model is used to determine the additional losses and esti-\nmate the load reduction (e.g., transformer derating [5]) required\nto maintain safe operation under nonsinusoidal operation. Lab-\noratory tests with linear and nonlinear transformer loading are\nperformed to verify simulated waveforms and demonstrate the\naccuracy of the proposed model.\nII. N\nONLINEAR TRANSFORMER MODEL\nThe proposed transformer model for asymmetrical, unbal-\nanced and (non)sinusoidal operation is derived from reference\n[15]. It is based on the simultaneous solution of electric and\nmagnetic equivalent circuits of three-phase three-leg trans-\nformers. The nodal equations of the circuits are solved in time\ndomain using iterative techniques such as Newton-Raphson.\nThe electric circuit governs the electrical connections of the\nsource, load and the transformer. For three-phase transformers,\nthe magnetic circuit is necessary to represent the multiple\nﬂux paths, reluctances and magnetomotive forces within\nmultilegged iron core structures [18]. It also incorporates the\nasymmetric magnetizing behavior of the core.\n0885-8977/$25.00 © 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

Electric equivalent circuit of three-phase three-leg transformers.\nFig. 2. Magnetic equivalent circuit of three-phase three-leg transformers.\nA. Electric Equivalent Circuit\nThe electric circuit of Fig. 1 can be simulated by most soft-\nware packages such as PSIM or PSPICE. Typically a nodal ma-\ntrix of equations describing the circuit is formed and solved\nthrough iterative time-domain numerical techniques.\nThe induced primary and secondary voltages are modeled as\nvoltage sources controlled by the time derivative of the mag-\nnetic ﬂuxes (Faraday’s Law). This establishes a link between\nthe magnetic and electric circuits.\nThe transformer model implements core loss resistance\nas a linear element in parallel with the induced primary voltage.\nSome models use nonlinear resistances to represent core losses\nbecause they are functions of harmonic voltage magnitudes and\nphase angles [6], [11]. However, according to [15] a linear\nis a valid simpliﬁcation with good agreement shown between\nmodel simulations and measured hysteresis loop areas, which\nare proportional to core losses. Likewise, winding resistances\nand leakage ﬂuxes are assumed constant. Fuchs et al. [7] state\nthis to be a valid approximation because the effects of saturation\nis usually negligible in winding elements.\nIn this paper, the electric circuit parameters, winding resis-\ntances, core loss resistances and leakage inductances are esti-\nmated from three-phase open circuit and short circuit tests.\nB. Magnetic Equivalent Circuit\nThe circuit in Fig. 2 is an approximation of the equivalent\ncircuit proposed by [9]. In this model, the seven reluctances of\nthe core are reduced to three reluctance parameters which can\nbe easily measured. This magnetic circuit can be programmed\nin PSPICE as an electrical circuit using the magnetic-electric\nduality principle.\nThe nonlinear reluctances in Fig. 2 are implemented in\nPSPICE as ﬂux sources dependent on their own MMF drops\n(1)\n,\n , and\n are the MMFs developed in the limbs by electric\ncircuit currents in the primary and secondary windings. This is\nanother relationship linking the electric and magnetic circuits.\nNonlinear reluctance functions can be ﬁtted to each leg’s\nmagnetizing characteristic [15]\n(2)\nwhere the empirically determined parameters\n ,\n ,\n , and\nare constants that shape the function to any measured saturation\ncurve\n .\n and\n are associated with the slope of\nthe linear and nonlinear regions, respectively,\n inﬂuences the\nsmoothness of the knee region and\n deﬁnes where saturation\nstarts.\nThe measurement procedure to obtain the magnetic circuit\nparameters of an asymmetric three-leg transformer is described\nin [9]. The zero-sequence open circuit test determines the linear\nair path reluctance,\n. The\n hysteresis loops for each limb\ncan be obtained by exciting a phase at a time and integrating the\ncorresponding induced voltages.\nIII. T RANSFORMER DERATING\nA. Modeling Additional Losses and Derating Factors\nThe nonlinear transformer model (Figs. 1–2) is used to cal-\nculate the derating required for nonsinusoidal operating condi-\ntions. The backwards solution approach similar to [5] is adopted\nthrough the following steps.\nStep 1:Compute rated losses by simulating the transformer\nfor rated sinusoidal excitation with rated resistive load.\nPSPICE is used to sum the fundamental and harmonic\nlosses using the following formula for each phase:\n(3)\nwhere\nStep 2: Impose nonsinusoidal operation (e.g., nonlinear\nloads and/or input voltage harmonics) while maintaining\nrated fundamental output kV A by ensuring that funda-\nmental load current and fundamental output voltage are at\nrated values\n(4)\nStep 3: If the fundamental output voltage is not at its\nrated value due to reactive power demand, adjust the\nfundamental input voltage to compensate.\nStep 4: Recalculate total power losses under nonsinusoidal\nconditions (Step 1) to determine the additional losses\n(5)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

K-Factor and Harmonic Loss Factor\nIEEE Standard C57.110 (1986) [16] is developed to limit\ntransformer temperature rise due to nonsinusoidal load currents.\nIt describes a method to calculate the load reduction required to\nnot exceed rated losses given the harmonic spectra of the load\ncurrent. Underwriters Laboratories derived the K-Factor from\nthis standard which is used to specify a class of transformers\ncapable of serving nonsinusoidal loads. In 1998, C57.110 stan-\ndard was updated with a factor similar to the K-Factor called the\nharmonic loss factor\n[17]\n(9)\nwhich are related as follows:\n(10)\nwhere\n is the rms load current at harmonic order\n , and\nrepresents the rated rms load current of the transformer.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

SIMULATION RESULTS\nThere are three sources of nonlinearity and harmonic gener-\nation in three-phase transformers; nonlinearity of the magnetic\ncore (e.g., internally generated nonsinusoidal magnetizing cur-\nrent), nonlinear loading (e.g., harmonic currents in the output\nterminal), and nonsinusoidal excitation (e.g., input harmonic\nvoltages). To investigate the impacts of these sources on the\nperformance, losses and derating of transformers, three oper-\nating conditions are investigated; sinusoidal excitation with\n(non)linear loads, nonsinusoidal excitation with (non)linear\nloads, and asymmetrical operation (Tables I–IV). Simulations\nare performed for two three-phase, wye-G/wye-G connected,\n50 Hz transformers: 60 kV A, 380/220 V [15] and 1 kV A, 440/50\nV.\nA. Cases 1–3: Sinusoidal Excitation With Linear Loads\nWith rated sinusoidal input voltages, three types of wye-con-\nnected loads (R, series RL and parallel RC) are simulated\n(Table I). Therefore, the only sources of harmonics are the non-\nlinearities associated with the transformer magnetic core. Fig. 3\nshows simulation results for sinusoidal excitation with a rated\nseries RL load. As expected, the nonsinusoidal magnetizing\ncurrent is small and has no signiﬁcant impact on the input and\noutput waveforms.\nB. Case 4: Sinusoidal Excitation With Three-Phase\nVSI-PWM-Based Induction Motor Drive\nMost harmonics in power transformers are due to nonlinear\nloads at the output terminals. To demonstrate this phenomenon,\na voltage source inverter PWM drive system is used as a non-\nlinear load at the secondary terminals of the nonlinear three-\nphase transformer. The PSPICE nonlinear transformer model\n(Section II) is combined with an ac-dc rectiﬁer and dc-ac PWM\ninverter. The PSPICE model for PWM inverter circuits from\n[26] is slightly modiﬁed into a variable frequency VSI-PWM-\nbased induction motor drive implemented with the nonlinear\ntransformer model. The load is selected such that rated funda-\nmental output kV A is delivered. Simulation results are shown\nin Fig. 4. The motor drive load exhibits signiﬁcant 5th and 7th\norder current harmonics\nand distorts the\ntransformer secondary voltage\n for the 60 kV A\ntransformer.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

Case 5: Sinusoidal Excitation With Three-Phase Diode\nBridge Rectiﬁer Load\nA three-phase diode bridge rectiﬁer (with rated resistive load\non the dc side) is placed at the output terminals of the trans-\nformer. The load is adjusted such that rated fundamental output\nkV A is delivered. The nonlinear load deteriorates the power\nquality of the output current\nand output\nvoltage\n in the 60 kV A transformer.\nFig. 5. Case 7—Transformer operation with nonsinusoidal excitation (20% 5th\nharmonic) and rated fundamental kV A delivered to wye-connected series RL\nloads (power factor /61/48 /58 /56 lagging).\nD. Cases 6–8: Nonsinusoidal Excitation With Linear Loads\nThe transformer is excited by nonsinusoidal voltages with\nrated fundamental component and different orders, magnitudes\nand phase angle of harmonic components. Simulations are per-\nformed for no-load, as well as R, RL, and RC loads. Fig. 5\nshows input and output waveforms for the rated series RL load\nand rated fundamental input voltage excitation with 20% of 5th\nharmonic at a phase shift of zero degree. Compared to Fig. 3,\nthe magnetizing current\nand primary ﬂux linkages\nwaveforms are more distorted and their total harmonic distor-\ntions have increased.\nE. Case 9: Nonsinusoidal Excitation With Three-Phase Diode\nBridge Rectiﬁer Load\nThe transformer is connected to a three-phase diode bridge\nrectiﬁer (with rated resistive load on the dc side) and is excited\nby nonsinusoidal voltages with rated fundamental component\nand 20% of 5th harmonic at a phase shift of zero degree. Simu-\nlation results are shown in Fig. 7.\nF. Case 10: Operation With Core and Load Asymmetries\nTransformer input and output waveforms are computed under\nasymmetric three-phase loading condition and asymmetric iron\ncore structure. Rated resistive loads are placed on phases A and\nC and a single-phase half-wave diode rectiﬁer (with rated re-\nsistive load on the dc side) is connected to phase B. Phase A\nleg is assumed to be damaged. A damaged leg refers to a leg’s\nmagnetizing characteristic that has been signiﬁcantly changed\n(e.g., 50% reduction) such that excitations with well below rated\nvoltage causes operation in the nonlinear region for that leg.\nSimulation results (Fig. 8) show that the secondary voltage for\nphase A is severely distorted. Furthermore, the damaged leg\ncauses small voltage distortions in the “healthy” legs (phases\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

The magnetizing waveforms are affected by the dam-\naged leg, compared to the nominal symmetrical case. This is due\nto ﬂux interaction with the other limbs.\nG. Additional Losses and Derating of Transformer\nThe nonlinear transformer model is used to calculate the der-\nating required for ﬁve of the above mentioned case studies. For\ncomparison, the derating based on C57.110 (\nand K-Factor)\nfor each case study has also been calculated (Tables II and IV).\nThe calculations are performed with the assumption that eddy\ncurrent losses comprise 5% of total losses.\nThe inﬂuence of load, power factor, nonlinearity, and input\nharmonic voltages on derating is demonstrated in Fig. 9. The\nfundamental kV A delivered to the load is maintained at rated\noperation while the ﬁfth harmonic magnitude with zero degree\nphase shift was increased from 0 to 20% of fundamental mag-\nnitude. The total losses rise at a different rate for each type of\nload. The parallel RC load is highly sensitive to input harmonic\nvoltage magnitudes (due to the occurrence of a resonance condi-\ntion, Fig. 6). This demonstrates transformers feeding capacitive\nloads may require signiﬁcant derating when exposed to voltage\nharmonics. The three-phase rectiﬁer, PWM motor drive load and\nRL series load show transformer losses always above rated op-\neration regardless of the presence of input harmonic voltages.\nTables II and IV show the derating factors required for some\nof the case studies. As expected, cases with input voltage\nharmonics and nonlinear loads require the most derating (e.g.,\n18.7% kV A reduction for the 60 kV A transformer with nonsi-\nnusoidal excitation and rated RC loading).\nFor the 1 kV A transformer, there is good agreement between\nderating factors computed based on C57.110 and the proposed\nmodel (Table IV). However, the results for the 60 kV A trans-\nformer derating show some disagreement. Several reasons exist\nfor this discrepancy. Pierce [4] states “There is no allowance\nin C57.110 for any increase in core loss for nonsinusoidal cur-\nrents” whereas the proposed model does include harmonic core\nlosses. Thus, as core losses become insigniﬁcant (e.g., for the\nsmall 1 kV A transformer), the error between derating factors\nbased on the model and C57.110 decreases.\nAnother source of error is the rated eddy losses\nestimation. By inspection of (11), large K-Factor and\n will\nmagnify any errors in\n . Furthermore, the K-Factor and\nmethods do not account for the dependence of eddy current\nlosses on harmonic voltages and their phase shifts, and in fact,\nassume the primary voltage to be sinusoidal. It is also stated\nin [16], [17] that C57.110 applies to two winding transformers,\nhowever, asymmetric core effects are not included.\nV. V\nALIDA TION OFRESULTS\nTo investigate the accuracy of the proposed nonlinear model,\nlaboratory measurements were performed for a three-phase,\nthree-leg, 1 kV A, 440/55V , 50 Hz transformer. A Fluke 434\npower quality analyzer was used to capture steady-state wave-\nforms and harmonic spectra. The two scenarios investigated\nare rated wye-connected resistive load and three-phase rectiﬁer\nwith rated dc load (Figs. 10 and 11). The transformer was ex-\ncited with rated three-phase voltages containing small amounts\nof low order harmonics.\nA. Rated Linear Load\nBalanced three-phase wye-connected resistive loads were\nconnected to the transformer secondary. Simulated and mea-\nsured waveforms for the rated linear load show excellent\nagreement (Fig. 10). This conﬁrms the validity of the model to\npredict steady-state responses for linear load conditions.\nB.

The following observations are\nmade:\n nonsinusoidal excitation and/or nonlinear loading deteri-\norate the power quality of input and output voltages and\ncurrents, causing signiﬁcant increases in losses that require\nlarge derating of the transformer;\n asymmetry of the load has inﬂuence on transformer mag-\nnetizing current waveforms; however, it does not cause\nconsiderable output voltage distortion;\n asymmetric iron core saturation (due to damaged leg) se-\nverely distorts the voltage of the asymmetric phase; fur-\nthermore, the damaged leg causes small voltage distortions\nin the “healthy” legs;\n derating values based on K-Factor/\nand the proposed\nmodel agree well when transformer core losses are small;\nthus, for large transformers there is a potential improve-\nment using the proposed derating method which, unlike\nthe IEEE C57.110 standard, includes the effect of funda-\nmental and harmonic core losses, nonsinusoidal input volt-\nages, and asymmetric nonlinear cores;\n transformer operation with a wye-connected RC parallel\nload was shown to have adverse effects when 5th harmonic\nvoltages were imposed at the input terminals; this is due\nto the occurrence of resonance causing the transformer to\nexhibit excessive power losses and require large derating;\n several limitations might be encountered in this model;\ncomplex circuits may cause difﬁculties in PSPICE’s\nNewton–Raphson algorithm to converge to a solution;\nfurthermore, accurate model parameters might be difﬁcult\nto determine from measurements and can potentially\nintroduce large errors into simulations;\n the presented simulation technique is general and can be\napplied to most three-phase distribution transformers with\nthree-leg cores; the transformer model could be included in\nlarge power system simulations for power quality assess-\nment and derating considerations.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] E.
