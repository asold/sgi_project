Various \nbiomedical knowledge graphs exist, however, they require further extension with relations between \nfood and biomedical entities. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three state‑of ‑the‑art \nrelation‑mining pipelines (FooDis, FoodChem and ChemDis) which extract relations between food, \nchemical and disease entities from textual data. We perform two case studies, where relations were \nautomatically extracted by the pipelines and validated by domain experts. The results show that \nthe pipelines can extract relations with an average precision around 70%, making new discoveries \navailable to domain experts with reduced human effort, since the domain experts should only \nevaluate the results, instead of finding, and reading all new scientific papers.\nNoncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs) account for more than 70% of deaths worldwide. Cardiovascular \ndiseases account for most NCD deaths (17.9 M people annually), followed by cancers (9.3 M), respiratory diseases \n(4.1 M), and diabetes mellitus (1.5 M)1,2. As the leading cause of death globally, most of the deaths that happen \nfrom cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are due to heart attacks and  strokes3. A lot of scientific evidence indicates \nthat between the most important risk factors for heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, alcohol and tobacco \nconsumption, and physical activity. Among all the factors that contribute to the development and progression \nof CVDs, diet is one of the major  ones4,5. It has been shown that eating more fruit and vegetables and decreasing \nthe salt in diet reduce the risk of CVDs.\nFurther, although there is a lot of knowledge about dietary effects on CVDs and broadly on NCDs, there are \nstill many unresolved research questions. Such questions are not easy to be answered because food and nutrition \nin relation to diseases are described by various concepts and entities that interact in various  ways6. For instance, \nthere are many foods (described by food entities) made up of components (described by chemical entities) 7 \nthat may fight NCDs (described by disease entities) while others can be  harmful8. These impacts are dependent \non the combination of foods and their chemicals, the state of the food (e.g., raw/cooked, fresh/molded, etc.), \nthe cooking method (e.g., steamed, grilled, baked, etc.), the health status of the person consuming food (e.g., \nhealthy, ill, allergic) and  others9. As there are many combinations of these factors, collecting and structuring the \nrelations between all the concepts and entities describing the impacts of food on NCDs is a very complex work \nexceeding human capabilities. And taking into account the fact that research in this field is still progressing, \nthe related knowledge evolves on a daily basis, making it challenging to follow. Such knowledge further opens \npossibilities to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to aid in the early detection (prediction) of NCDs as well \nas their progression. However, before developing predictive AI methods, unstructured (textual) data available \nin cohorts, electronic health records (EHRs), registries, and scientific and grey literature needs to be structured \nand normalized/linked to domain semantic resources and further included in knowledge bases (KBs) which can \nbe utilized for predictive modeling and integrated into health systems which will make the information easily \naccessible to medical professionals. To this end, user interfaces play a critical role in ensuring that healthcare \nprofessionals can effectively utilize AI systems to provide high-quality care to their  patients10.\nA Knowledge Graph (KG) is a type of KB, where knowledge is stored in the form of entities characterized \nby some attributes, and relations connecting the entities. Conventional methods of KG construction can be \nbroadly categorized into manual, and automatic, or semi-automatic methods. The benefits of manual creation \nand curation approaches are their high precision and  reliability11, however, due to the high amount of effort \nOPEN\n1Jožef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia. 2Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School, Ljubljana 1000, \nSlovenia. 3Clinic Doctor 24-hours, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia. *email: gjorgjina.cenikj@ijs.si\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2023) 13:7815  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34981-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nrequired by domain experts, they also have lower recall rates, poor scalability and time  efficiency12. Automatic \nand semi-automatic KG construction is enabled by text-mining methods, which are able to extract entities and \nrelations which can be structured as a KG.\nIn the biomedical domain, automatic and semi-automatic structuring of textual data in the form of KGs is an \nactive research area, which typically involves the use of Information Extraction (IE) pipelines consisting of mul-\ntiple components. These components include Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods, which extract specific \ntypes of entities from raw text, Named Entity Linking (NEL) methods, whose goal is to map entity mentions to \nentries in a given KB, and Relation Extraction (RE) methods, which aim to automatically detect relations between \n entities13. Over the past 20 years, significant progress has been made in creating multiple IE pipelines for the \nbiomedical domain. These pipelines primarily concentrate on identifying genotype and phenotype entities, as \nwell as health-related entities such as diseases, treatments, drugs, and others. To allow their development, several \ncollaborative workshops, as part of conference events like  BioNLP14,  BioCreative15,  i2b216, and  DDIExtraction17, \nhave been arranged to provide semantic resources (e.g., annotated corpora, ontologies) that will further allow \nthe developing of biomedical IE pipelines. The efforts done in the biomedical domain are focused entirely on \nbiomedical concepts and not investigating relations with food concepts. On the other side, most of the efforts \ndone in IE in the food domain are focused on relations that do not involve health/biomedical concepts, and even \nmore, are developed using static data that is already presented in some other resources (e.g., datasets, controlled \nvocabularies, ontologies), so they need to be updated when new data is available in these resources. In addi -\ntion, only a few studies have concentrated on traditional text mining techniques that employ sentiment analysis \nthrough manual feature  extraction18–20. Despite this, the food and nutrition domain is low-resourced in semantic \ndata resources compared to the biomedical domain. There is a lack of annotated food-disease relation corpora \nthat serve as a benchmark and help develop IE pipelines. Even more, food semantic resources such as  FoodOn21, \n FoodEx222, are still under development (i.e., frequently updating them with new data) to support IE activities.\nTo bridge the gap between the food and biomedical domains, we introduce an approach that uses language \nmodels to extract the relations that exist between food, chemical, and disease entities and further normalize them to \nallow the creation of a KG. In our case, we evaluate the approach to trace the new knowledge about CVDs and milk \nproducts. The benefit of our approach is that we are not using the information that already exists in some static \nresources (e.g., databases), but try to catch all relations from textual data related to CVDs and milk products (milk \nwas selected as a case study since it is rich in nutrients, a resource of proteins, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids, \nwhich have an important impact on human metabolism and health) available in scientific abstracts, where new \nfindings are presented. This makes the methodology easy to apply on new corpora of scientific abstracts, where \nthe results of the pipelines can point out areas where the KG should be updated with new entities or relations.\nRelated work\nA recent survey on knowledge-based biomedical data  science23 highlights the application of KGs in the bio-\nmedical and clinical domain in improving the retrieval of information from large sources of clinical data or \n literature24–26, providing evidence to support phenomena observed in  data27,28, using link prediction to com-\nplete missing information and hypothesize previously unknown  relationships29, and improving patient data \n representation30–32. In the biomedical domain, IE pipelines have been developed for the extraction of drug-disease \n relations33,34 and disease-symptom  relations35 from biomedical literature. A Coronavirus KG has been constructed \nby merging the Analytical Graph, with a collection of published scientific  articles36. A PubMed KG has been \nconstructed by extracting biomedical entities from PubMed abstracts and enriching it with funding, author, and \naffiliation  data37. A recent  work12 proposes the construction of domain-specific KGs with minimal supervision, \nwhich is able to derive open-ended relations from unstructured biomedical articles without the need of extensive \nlabeling. While this study is largely focused on data integration, and only uses NER to extract the biomedical \nentities from the literature, our study goes a step further in the RE task, to extract the relations between the enti-\nties based on the text in the scientific abstracts, so that new relations can be added between entities in existing \nresources. Apart from using biomedical scientific papers as a source of information, EHRs have also been used \nfor extracting disease-symptom  relations38 and constructing a medical KG with nine biomedical entity  types39.\nIn the food domain, FoodKG has been recently developed for representing food recipe data including their \ningredients and nutritional  content40 by enriching a large amount of recipe data from Recipe1M dataset with the \nnutritional information available from USDA ’s National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference represented \nwith  FoodOn21 semantic meta-data. Additionally,  FoodKG41 was developed by using the existing text and graph \nembedding techniques applied to a controlled vocabulary called AGROVOC, to model the relations that exist \nin a plethora of datasets related to food, energy and water.\nResults\nTo trace the knowledge about food, chemical, and disease interactions, we have shown the creation of a KG cen-\ntered around the impact of different foods and chemicals on CVDs, and the other targeting the composition of \nthe selected food item “milk” , as well as its beneficial and detrimental effects on different NCDs. For this purpose, \nthree NLP pipelines, called FooDis, FoodChem, and ChemDis, were combined to extract “food-disease” , “food-\nchemical” , and “chemical-disease” relations from textual data. Semantically, we distinguish two relations between \nfood-disease and chemical-disease entity pairs, which are “treat” and “cause” . In the case of food-chemical entity \npairs, we extracted only one relation which is “contains” . All three pipelines were executed twice, on two different \ncorpora, one that was collected for CVDs and one collected for milk products. In both use cases, the searched \nkeywords were selected by domain experts. In the CVDs case, a more general keyword was selected “heart disease \nfood” , since we would like to retrieve broader aspects between different cardiovascular events and food products. \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2023) 13:7815  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34981-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nThis ends up with 9984 abstracts. In the milk use case, three keywords were selected by the domain experts i.e., \n“milk composition” , “milk disease” , and “milk health benefits” .\nTable 1a presents the number of abstracts that were retrieved and used in the analysis for both use cases, \ntogether with the keywords used to retrieve them, while Table  1b presents the number of relations that were \nextracted for both use cases.\nFigure 1a features the KG constructed by running the three pipelines for the two application use cases. The \nsame nodes are grouped together by normalizing the extracted food, chemical, and disease entities.\nTo go into more detail how the KG is constructed, in Fig.  1b we present an example using the relations \nextracted for the “heart failure” disease entity. The green nodes, “meat products” , “salt” and “dietary fish oil” \nrepresent the food entities for which the FooDis pipeline extracted a relation with the “heart failure” disease \nentity, meaning that they have some effect on its development or treatment. In particular, the red edges connect-\ning the “heart failure” disease entity and the food entities “meat products” , and “salt” indicate that the pipeline \nidentified a “cause” relation, i.e. meat products, and salt can contribute to the occurrence of heart failure. On the \nother hand, the green edge between the “dietary fish oil” entity and the “heart failure” disease entity indicates \na “treat” relation, i.e. the pipeline identified that dietary fish oil has a beneficial effect to heart failure. Similarly, \nthe ChemDis pipeline identified that the chemical entities “DHA ” , “ester” , “acid, n-3 fatty” , “antidiabetics cana-\ngliflozin” , “omega-3 fatty acid” and “calcium” can be used for treating “heart failure” , while the chemical entities \n“(-)-cocaine” and “vitamin E” can contribute to the development of “heart failure” . Table 2 presents the supporting \nsentences from scientific abstracts from which the relations were extracted and further used for constructing the \ngraph presented in Fig. 1b. Next, such graphs are connected based on the same entities to link the information \nfrom different abstracts. Further, to validate the extracted information, domain experts were involved to check \nthe extracted relations for both use cases.\nUse case: cardiovascular diseases. For the CVDs use case, a highly-skilled domain expert (an MD with \nmore than 40 years of working experience in cardiology) evaluated the extractions from the three pipelines. \nThe relations that were evaluated are extracted after the “Final relation determination” step from the FooDis, \nFoodChem and ChemDis pipelines. All three pipelines utilized here follow the same workflow. Each extracted \nrelation is determined by all sentences where information about it is presented. We called them “supporting \nsentences” . The sentences can be from the same or different abstracts, since information about the same relation \ncan be investigated in different papers.\nDomain expert evaluation. Each pipeline provides the result as a 6-tuple i.e., (name of the first entity, named of \nthe second entity, synonyms for the first entity, synonyms for the second entity, relation, supporting sentences), \nwhich is further evaluated by the domain expert. The domain expert was asked to assign a binary indicator of the \ntruthfulness of the relation. The pipelines were then evaluated by taking the mean of the correctness indicators \nassigned by the annotator for each relation and pipeline, which we refer to as the precision in the remainder of \nthis section. In particular, if a pipeline extracted three relations, and the expert marked two of these as correct \n(binary indicators 1,0,1), the reported precision would be 0.66.\nFigure 2a presents the number of relations extracted by each of the pipelines for the CVDs study, and the \nnumber of relations that the domain expert evaluated. We need to point out here that all extracted relations were \nprovided to the domain expert, however, the evaluation has been performed only on those relations for which the \ndomain expert has expert knowledge. Because of this, the human evaluation process covers 44% of the “contains” \nTable 1.

From it, the FooDis pipeline achieves the highest precision of 0.79 for the “cause” and 0.78 \nfor the “treat” relation. The lowest precision of 0.68 is achieved by the ChemDis pipeline for the extraction of \nthe “cause” relation.\nSince the three pipelines extract a relation based on supporting sentences, in the Supplementary Materials, \nwe have presented the distribution of the number of relations versus their number of supporting sentences.\nAll of the pipelines extract more than 74% of the relations based on a single supporting sentence. The Chem-\nDis and FoodChem pipelines can find a larger number of supporting sentences for some relations compared \nto the FooDis pipeline. In particular, the ChemDis pipeline can find up to five supporting sentences to identify \n“cause” relations and up to 14 supporting sentences to identify “treat” relations, while the FooDis pipeline uses \nup to three, and four supporting sentences for the “cause” and “treat” relations, respectively.\nNext, to see how the mean precision is affected by the number of supporting sentences, we analyze for each \nsemantic relation separately. The results are presented in Supplementary Materials. From the conducted analysis, \nwe can conclude that the mean precision is proportional to the number of supporting sentences. Almost for \nall relations, a precision of 1.00 is reached when the number of supporting relations is sufficiently high. This \nindicates that when the number of supporting sentences for a relation increases, there is an agreement between \nthe domain expert validation and the result provided by our pipelines, with some exceptions listed in the Sup -\nplementary Materials.\nError analysis. Next, we analyze the types of false discoveries produced by FooDis, FoodChem, and ChemDis \npipelines.\nFigure 3 features the relations with the highest number of supporting sentences for four chemical entities: \n“carbohydrates” , “fatty acid” , “sodium” and “vitamin d” . Here the results for the selected chemical entity from \nthe two pipelines that deal with chemical entities (i.e., ChemDis and FoodChem) are presented. The green bars \nrefer to the number of sentences in which the relation was correctly identified, while the purple plots refer to \nthe number of false positive sentences for that relation, i.e. sentences where the relation was identified, however, \nit was marked as incorrect by the experts.\nFor the “carbohydrates” entity, the ChemDis pipeline produced the false positive relation “carbohydrates-\ntreat-cardiomyopathy” when the supporting sentences suggested that a low-carbohydrate diet is recommended \nfor treating cardiomyopathy. In this case, the pipeline fails to identify that a reduction of the chemical entity is \nrequired to treat the disease. In addition, the FoodChem pipeline produces a false discovered relation “bulk-\ncontains-carbohydrates” , when the supporting sentence was saying that these two entities are contained in another \nentity, “dry beans” . For the “fatty acid” chemical entity, the ChemDis pipeline produced the false positive rela-\ntion “fatty acid-cause-dysfunction endothelial” , when the supporting sentence was saying that increased fatty \nacid levels and endothelial dysfunction were contributing to the development of another disease, “sepsis” . The \nFoodChem pipeline produced the false entities, “wine-contains-fatty acid” and “acid fatty trans-contains-fatty \nacid” . In the first case, the two entities were co-occurring in the supporting sentence without any relation, while \nin the second one, the sentence was saying that trans fatty acids are a subcategory of fatty acids.

This \nis also the reason for false positive relations extraction for the other two disease entities featured in the figure.\nUse case: milk. For the use case related to the composition and health effects of milk, two highly-skilled \ndomain experts evaluated the results from all three pipelines: a chemist and a food and nutritional scientist.\nDomain expert evaluation. From the 33,111 processed abstracts related to the milk case study, the three pipe-\nlines extracted a total of 6792 relations, from which 5139 were evaluated by the two domain experts. We need to \npoint out again that all extracted relations were provided to the domain experts, however, they evaluated only \nthose relations for which they have domain expertise. Figure  5a features the number of relations extracted by \neach pipeline for the milk case study, and the number of relations the experts evaluated. The highest number of \nevaluated relations were the “contains” relations extracted by the FoodChem pipeline, and the experts were able \nto evaluate 96% of them (2849 out of 2754). The experts also evaluated 73% of the “treat” and 78% of the “cause” \nrelations produced by the FooDis, 34% of the “cause” relations, and 35% of the “treat” relations produced by the \nChemDis pipeline.\nThe mean precision for each of the five semantic relations for both domain experts is presented in Fig.  5b \nseparately. In addition, we have also presented the mean precision for each type of relation by averaging the \nprecision across both domain experts. From the figure, we can see that the first domain expert, who evaluated \nthe relations which were supported by a single sentence, identified more incorrect relations than the second \ndomain expert, who evaluated the relations supported by multiple sentences.\nThe overall mean precision for each of the five relations averaged across both domain experts are as follows:\nFigure 4.

On average, the precision of each \nextracted relation is around 70%. This indicates that the pipelines allow us to trace the knowledge and make it \navailable to domain experts. This reduces the time required by the domain experts, since they should only evalu-\nate the results, instead of finding and reading all new papers.\nEven though the pipelines can contribute to the automation of the KG construction process and reduce the \nefforts required by the experts in structuring scientific text, there are still opportunities for further improvements. \nA large portion of the incorrectly extracted relations is due to the partial extraction of entities, especially by the \nfood NER methods, which is a consequence of the simple dictionary-based approach. We want to point out here \nthat in initial experiments, we also considered other food NER methods that are corpus-based and involve the \ntraining of a ML model on text annotated with food entities. At that time,  BuTTER44 and  FoodNER45 were the \nonly corpus-based food NER models. However, because these models were trained on food recipe text, which \nis very different from scientific text both in the contents and the writing style, the models failed to generalize \nto scientific text and did not produce satisfactory results. As far as the chemical and disease NER models are \nconcerned, we chose to use the SABER method, since it performs both the NER and NEL tasks and is reported \nto have good predictive performance.\nFurther extension of the pipelines is needed to capture quantities, i.e. whether a surplus or a deficit of the \nentities in question lead to the development or treatment of the diseases. Some of the relations are false positives \ndue to mistakes made by the RE models, for instance, where a relation was extracted between entities that simply \nco-occur in a sentence without any relation, or the relation is expressed in the sentence, but between different \nentities. The RE models produce such errors, especially in the case where a single sentence contains a lot of enti-\nties or expresses multiple relations. This is likely due to the RE models extracting the “cause” and “treat” relations \nbeing trained using transfer learning, and the RE models extracting the “contains” relation being trained using \nsmall amounts of manually annotated data. The annotations produced as part of this study can be used to re-train \nthe RE models using larger quantities of high-quality data.\nFrom the point of view of assessing the importance of milk in our diet, it is crucial to assess the large amount \nof data available to obtain consistent outcomes and to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of milk con -\nsumption. The presented approach can provide evidence that can be used to develop or renew dietary and health \nguidelines for relevant decision-makers.\nMethods\nIn this study, three relation mining pipelines (FooDis, FoodChem and ChemDis) are used to extract relations \nbetween food, chemical, and disease entities, from the raw text of abstracts of biomedical scientific textual data.\nThe pipelines follow a common template, which is presented in Fig. 6. The initial step is querying PubMed and \nretrieving abstracts of scientific papers. Different Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Linking \n(NEL) methods are applied for the extraction of food, chemical, and disease entities, which are linked to existing \nresources in the biomedical and food domain.\nNext, sentences that express facts or analysis of the research and contain at least one pair of different entities \nare extracted from the abstracts. Abstracts typically include the objective, hypothesis, methodology, and main \nfindings of the research. However, not all of these pieces of information are reliable sources for drawing conclu-\nsions, since if the authors’ hypothesis was untrue, and we were to extract information from the sentence that \ndescribes that hypothesis, our findings would be incorrect. For this reason, it is necessary to identify sentences \nwhich describe the objective, hypothesis, or methodology of the research and only extract relations from the \nsentences which describe the research findings or previously known facts.\nThe sentences are annotated for the existence of a “cause” , “treat” or “contains” relation, and the entity pairs \nare connected with one of these relations on the basis of the gathered evidence.\nNamed entity recognition. Food named entity recognition. Even though corpus-based methods have \nalready been developed for the food  domain44,45, these methods are trained on the FoodBase  corpus46, which \ncontains recipe texts. As was observed in our experiments, when applied on scientific text, the corpus-based \nmethods have poor generalization, so in order to extract the food entities, we opted for a simpler, dictionary-\nbased approach which uses a dictionary of food names extracted from the Unified Medical Language System \n(UMLS) Metathesaurus, which is not dependent on the data used for training the model. For this purpose, we \nuse the MRSTY and MRCONSO tables from the UMLS Rich Release Format  files47. The construction of the \ndictionary involves two steps: extracting the identifiers of all concepts with the semantic type “food” from the \nMRSTY table, and extracting all of the names used to refer to each of the food concepts from the MRCONSO \ntable. In this dictionary, we have a total of 36,836 instances. By matching the words in the abstracts with the \nnames of food entities defined in the dictionary extracted from the UMLS, we are also able to perform the NEL \ntask, i.e. link the extracted food entities with their identifiers in the UMLS, and further find their identifiers in \nother KBs to which the UMLS identifiers are linked.\nDisease named entity recognition. The Sequence Annotator for Biomedical Entities and Relations (SABER)48 is \na tool providing several pre-trained models for biomedical NER and NEL, using a neural network architecture \nconsisting of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Conditional Random Fields. We use the DISO pre-\n11\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2023) 13:7815  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34981-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ntrained model to extract disease entities, which can be “ Acquired Abnormality” , “ Anatomical Abnormality” , “Cell \nor Molecular Dysfunction” , “Congenital Abnormality” , “Pathologic Function” , “Disease or Syndrome” , “Mental or \nBehavioral Dysfunction” , “Neoplastic Process” , “Sign or Symptom” . Apart from identifying these entities, SABER \ncan also perform NEL, i.e. link the extracted entities to identifiers in the Disease  Ontology49.\nChemical named entity recognition. We use the pre-trained model CHED from the  SABER48 tool to extract \nchemical entities which can be mentioned in the text using common and trademark names, abbreviations, \nmolecular formulas, chemical database identifiers, and names defined in the nomenclature of the International \nUnion of Pure and Applied Chemistry. SABER is also capable of linking the extracted chemical entities to the \nPubChem  database50.\nRelation extraction. SAFFRON relation extraction model. SAFFRON51 is a RE model which employs \ntransfer learning to identify “cause” or “treat” relations.  BERT52,  RoBERTa53 and  BioBERT54 models are trained \non data that is annotated for the existence of “cause” and “treat” relations between different types of biomedi-\ncal entities in the  CrowdTruth55–57, Adverse Drug  Events58 and the FoodDisease  datasets59. We choose to use \nthe Single Sequence Classifier (SSC) models introduced  in51, which are trained by fine-tuning BioBERT and \nRoBERTa models to perform the RE task on the CrowdTruth and FoodDisease datasets, since these datasets are \nannotated for the existence of both the “cause” and the “treat” relation, unlike the models trained on the Adverse \nDrug Events dataset, which can only identify the “cause” relation. The occurrences of the biomedical entities in \neach annotated sentence are masked to prevent the models from learning relations between specific entities and \nteach them to instead recognize relations based on the context words used to express the relation, so they can \nsuccessfully generalize to the task of recognizing the relations, regardless of the type of entities between which \nthey occur. Each model outputs a binary indicator of the existence of a “cause” or “treat” relation.\nThe SAFFRON models are applied to each sentence that contains 2 entities of the required type (at least 1 \nfood and 1 disease entity, or at least 1 food and 1 chemical entity), and expresses a “Fact” or “ Analysis” of the \nresearch article. In particular, the 4 models (BioBERT trained on the FoodDisease dataset, RoBERTa trained on \nthe FoodDisease dataset, BioBERT trained on the CrowdTruth dataset, RoBERTa trained on the CrowdTruth \ndataset) are applied for the extraction of each relation, “cause” or “treat” . A voting strategy is used to combine \nthe binary predictions of the 8 models. A “cause” relation is assigned if at least 3 out of the 4 models which are \ntrained to extract this relation produce a positive prediction, and at most 1 out of the 4 models which are trained \nto predict the “treat” relation produce a positive prediction and vice versa. If this condition is not satisfied for \nany of the “cause” or “treat” relations, the sentence is discarded.\nFigure 6.  Overview of the general pipeline template.\n12\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2023) 13:7815  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34981-4\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFoodChem relation extraction model. The FoodChem RE  model59 is used to extract the “contains” relations \nbetween food and chemical entities. For this purpose, 3 transformer-based models (BERT, BioBERT and RoB-\nERTa) are applied on each sentence that contains at least one food and one chemical entity, and expresses a “Fact” \nor “ Analysis” . A voting scheme is implemented in such a way that a “contains” relation is assigned to a (food, \nchemical, sentence) triple if at least 2 of the 3 models produce a positive prediction for the existence of the rela-\ntion. If less than 2 models produce a positive prediction, the triple is discarded.\nPipelines. The FooDis, FoodChem and ChemDis pipelines follow the same methodological template and \nonly differ in the NER and RE methods used to extract the entities and relations.\nFooDis pipeline. The FooDis pipeline extracts “cause” and “treat” relations between food and disease entities. \nA dictionary-based NER method using the food names in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is \napplied to extract the food entities from the text of the abstracts. The SABER DISO model is used to extract the \ndisease entities.\nFoodChem pipeline. The FoodChem pipeline extracts “contains” relations between food and chemical entities. \nThe entities are extracted using the corresponding NER methods, and the FoodChem RE model is applied to \neach sentence.\nChemDis pipeline. The ChemDis pipeline extracts “cause” and “treat” relations between chemical and disease \nentities. The pipeline components are identical to the FooDis pipeline, with the exception of the use of a different \npre-trained SABER model. In the ChemDis pipeline, the SABER CHED model is used to extract chemical enti-\nties, whereas in the FooDis pipeline, the SABER DISO model is used to extract disease entities.\nKnowledge graph construction. The three pipelines FooDis, FoodChem and ChemDis produce triples \nin the form of (entity1, relation, entity2). Each entity is further linked to an external KB. Such outputs are natu-\nrally suited for the construction of a KG. The constructed KG contains nodes that represent the food, chemical \nand disease concepts from the external KBs, as determined by their unique identifiers. In the case when several \nterms can be used to refer to the same entity (i.e. the terms are synonyms), the terms are grouped by their unique \nidentifiers. This means that the relations in which a unique entity is involved are determined based on all of the \nrelations identified for its synonyms. In order to make the results more easily interpretable, instead of only using \nthe identifiers in the constructed KG, we assign to each entity node one of the synonyms as its name. The edges \nin the constructed KG represent the “cause” , “treat” or “contains” relations.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we conduct an evaluation of three Information Extraction pipelines (FooDis, FoodChem and \nChemDis). The pipelines extract relations between food, chemical, and disease entities from abstracts of scien -\ntific papers. Three domain experts evaluated the pipelines for two use cases, the first one being centered around \ncardiovascular diseases, and the second one targeting milk and milk products. This is the first application of the \nthree pipelines where the results were evaluated by domain experts. The FoodChem pipeline, extracting “con-\ntains” relations between food and chemical entities, achieves a mean precision of 0.70 when aggregated across \nthe evaluation of the three experts. The ChemDis pipeline, capturing relations between chemical and disease \nentities, obtains a mean precision of 0.56 for the extraction of the “cause” relation and 0.79 for the “treat” rela -\ntion. The FooDis pipeline achieves a mean precision of 0.69 for the extraction of the “cause” relation and 0.73 \nfor the “treat” relation. The conducted evaluation and the expert consultation revealed potential directions for \nfurther improvement of the pipelines. The annotated data is also a valuable resource that can be used to retrain \nand improve the RE models.\nData availibility\nThe relevant data is available at (https:// github. com/ gjorg jinac/ langu age_ models_ to_ bio_ kgs).\nReceived: 11 January 2023; Accepted: 10 May 2023\nReferences\n 1.
