Maintaining the power ﬂow and power\nquality within their accepted limits is a challenging task.\nThe formation of meshed hybrid microgrids is an effective\nmethod to improve the power system. The smart trans-\nformer (ST) is a promising solution to establish meshed\nhybrid microgrids in the distribution system. This paper\nanalyzes the performance of an ST based meshed hybrid\nmicrogrid interconnected to the main grid feeder through\nmedium voltage (MV) dc link of a second ST. The coordi-\nnated operation of interconnected ST system is proposed\nto explore the features of the conﬁguration. During normal\noperation, the MVDC bus voltage is controlled by one ST,\nand this reduces the complexity of the overall control. The\nmain grid and microgrid MVAC source failure and converter\nfault conditions are explored to analyze the reliability of\nthe proposed microgrid structure. Moreover, the reactive\npower support capability and active power losses for the\nproposed system are compared with the existing solutions.\nSimulation and experimental results are presented to show\nthe operation of the proposed system.\nIndex Terms—Meshed hybrid microgrid, medium voltage\ndc (MVDC) system, smart transformer (ST).\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nT\nHE local consumption of the energy generated from the\ndistributed generation (DG) sources are more economical\nand it leads to the formation of microgrids [1], [2]. Even\nthough microgrids can exist independent of ac main grid con-\nnection, the interconnection with existing ac grids improves\nthe power quality and reliability of microgrids.\nIn the modern power transmission sector, voltage source\nconverter (VSC) based high voltage (HV) dc transmission\nsystems are popular for the interconnection of DG sources\nlocated away from the main grid [3]. The features such\nManuscript received October 29, 2020; revised January 23, 2021;\naccepted March 26, 2021.\nThis work was supported by ”Visvesvaraya PhD Scheme, MeitY , Govt.\nof India MEITY -PHD-1228”, and research grant ECR/2017/001564, Sci-\nence and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science\nand Technology, India.\nHrishikesan VM, and Chandan Kumar are with Electronics and Elec-\ntrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Guwa-\nhati, Guwahati, 781039, India (e-mail: hrishieee@gmail.com; chan-\ndank@iitg.ac.in).\nMarco Liserre is with Chair of Power electronics, Kiel University, Kiel,\nD-24143 Germany.

Some of the features that MVDC distribution system\noffers are: independent control of active and reactive power\nﬂows, improved stability for existing ac distribution system,\ndecoupling grids with different frequencies, etc. [5], [6]. The\nconventional ac-based microgrids faces challenges in ﬂexibly\ncontrolling the active power ﬂow based on the DG output\nand load condition. Connecting back-to-back (BTB) converter\nsystem in a conventional ac distribution line improves the\nactive and reactive power control features in the system and\n[8] analyzes the voltage sag in a BTB converter connected MV\nradial ac feeder. Moreover, the reliability of power supply is\naffected in the conventional conﬁgurations and [9] investigates\nthe usage of dc links for providing highly reliable meshed\ndistribution grids.\nThe ac and dc system interconnections are realized using\nthe power electronic based solutions. The smart transformer\n(ST) is a power electronics based transformer with energy\nmanagement features in the distribution system [10], [11]. The\nST with three-stage power conversion structure is a suitable\ncandidate for distribution system applications due to the pres-\nence of two intermediate dc links at MVDC level and low\nvoltage (LV) dc level [10]. The dc links are appropriate for the\nintegration of battery energy storage system (BESS), electric\nvehicle (EV) charging station and renewable energy source\n(RES) [12]. The impact of ST in the MV grid is studied in [13],\nand the additional features in comparison with conventional\npower transformer (CPT) are listed. The diverse services that\nST offers include frequency regulation [14], peak load shaving\noperation [15], voltage control [16], capacity enhancement\n[17], establishing interconnected microgrids [18], hierarchical\npower management strategy [19], etc.\nThe meshed hybrid microgrids are considered to be an\nemerging trend in the reconﬁguration of microgrids and the\nMVDC system is also utilized for the formation of highly\nreliable meshed grids [7]. The ST’s capability to form meshed\nhybrid microgrid is studied in [20] where the LVDC bus of ST\nis extended in parallel to the LV AC distribution system, and\nthe DG sources are integrated to the LVDC line. Similarly, the\navailability of MVDC bus of ST opens up an option to realize\nthe MVDC distribution system [12], [21].\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel.

S YSTEM CONFIGURATION\nFig. 1(a) shows a conventional ac microgrid conﬁguration\nderived from [7], [22]. The 11-kV source in the microgrid is\nconstituted by a number of renewable sources. The microgrid\nMV AC bus is connected to a feeder in the main grid through\nAC lines. In the microgrid MV AC bus, the DG unit (DG-1)\nand loads (Load-1) are connected through 11/0.4 kV CPT. In\nthe main grid MV AC feeder, the loads (Load-2) are connected\nthrough a 11/0.4 kV CPT.\nFig. 1(b) shows the modiﬁed ac microgrid conﬁguration\nderived from [8]. For incorporating controlled power transfer,\na BTB system connects the microgrid with main grid feeder\nthrough AC lines. The loads and DG connections remain same\nas in Fig. 1(a).\nFig. 1(c) shows an ST based conﬁguration [21]. Both\nSTs use three-stage architecture. The ﬁrst stage is a three-\nlevel, three-phase MV converter connects between MV AC grid\nand MVDC bus [10]. The second stage consists of a dual\nactive bridge (DAB) converter with high frequency transformer\nisolation connected between MVDC and LVDC buses [23].\nThe third stage is a two level, dc-ac converter maintaining\nthree-phase balanced sinusoidal voltage at the LV AC bus of the\nST [24]. In the microgrid, the CPT is replaced by ST-1 and the\nload-1 and DG-1 are connected to the ST-1 LV AC bus. In the\nmain grid MV AC feeder, the CPT is replaced by ST-2 and the\nload-2 is connected to the LV AC bus. The AC interconnection\nlines remain same as in the Fig. 1(a). The controlled power\ntransfer capability is absent in this conﬁguration.\nIn order to incorporate the controlled power transfer ﬂexi-\nbility, the Fig. 1(c) is modiﬁed.

The ST-1 and ST-2 controls the inter grid\nactive power transfer along with the supply of their own loads.\nThe loads and DG connection remain same as shown in Fig.\n1(c).\nIII. O PERATING MODES\nThis section discusses the operating modes of the ST based\nMVDC interconnected meshed hybrid microgrid. Two oper-\nating modes are considered in this paper named normal and\nemergency modes. A ﬂow-chart representation of the operating\nmodes is given in Fig. 2.\nA. Normal Mode\nThe normal operating mode is deﬁned when the following\nconditions are satisﬁed:\n• microgrid and main grid MV AC sources are operating\nwithout any faults and delivering required power\n• ST-1 MV and ST-2 MV converters are operating without\nfault or maintenance.\nIn the normal operating mode, two scenarios are considered.\nIndependent operation of STs and inter-feeder power transfer.\nThese operations are controlled by the loading on the meshed\nhybrid microgrid LV AC bus. The net active power loading\n(Plv1−net) is given by,\nPlv1−net = Pllv1 −Pglv1 (1)\nwhere Pllv1 and Pglv1, respectively are the active power\nloading and generation at the meshed hybrid microgrid LV AC\nbus. The power transfer to the main grid feeder is scheduled\nonly when the ST-1 LV AC net active power loading is less than\na predeﬁned active power lower limit (P lv1−ll). Similarly, the\nactive power absorption from main grid feeder is scheduled\nduring microgrid peak load hours when the ST-1 LV AC loading\nis greater than a predeﬁned active power upper limit (Plv1−ul).\nThe inter-feeder power transfer (P t) is given by,\nPt = Popr −Plv1−net (2)\nwhere Popr is the predeﬁned active power operating point.\nThis operating power is deﬁned based on the availability\nof excess power in the microgrid during low-load condition\nand amount of load shaving required during peak demand\ncondition. The ST-1 MV converter power reference during this\nmode of operation is given as,\nP∗\nstmv1 =\n{\nPlv1−net, if Plv1−ll ≤Plv1−net ≤Plv1−ul\nPopr, otherwise.\n(3)\nThe power reference (P∗\ndc) for MVDC power transfer is given\nby,\nP∗\ndc =\n{\n0, if Plv1−ll ≤Plv1−net ≤Plv1−ul\nPopr −Plv1−net, otherwise.\n(4)\nDuring the normal operating mode, the ST-2 MV converter\nactive power reference (P ∗\nstmv2) is given as,\nP∗\nstmv2 = Pllv2 (5)\nwhere Pllv2 is the active power loading at the ST-2 LV AC side.\nB. Emergency Mode\nIn the emergency mode, two scenarios are analyzed in this\npaper. First one is the operation of system during the failure of\nMV AC microgrid/ST-1 MV converter. Second case shows the\nfailure of MV AC main grid/ST-2 MV converter. In the event of\nST-1 MV converter or MV AC microgrid failure, the ST-2 MV\nconverter active power reference is given by (5). The active\npower exchanged from MV AC microgrid remains at zero and\nthe loads at the ST-1 LV AC bus is served from main grid\nthrough MVDC interconnection. Similarly, during the MV AC\nmain grid or ST-2 MV converter failure, the ST-1 supports the\nST-2 LV AC loads by the transfer of power through MVDC\ninterconnection.\nIV. P OWER CONVERTER CONTROL\nIn this section, the control strategy of different power\nconverters are explained for normal and emergency modes.\nThe overall control block diagram is shown in Fig. 3. The\nsubscript i is used to indicate the ST-1, ST-2 related terms\n(i= 1,2).\nThe control strategy of ST-1 and ST-2 MV converters are\ndifferent as they need to control the power transfer between\ntwo feeders. ST dc-dc and ST LV converters of ST-1 and ST-\n2 are controlled in the similar fashion therefore, they are not\nexplained separately.\nA. ST -1 MV Converter\nIn this study, the ST-1 is selected as the primary power\ncontroller (PPC) and controls the MVDC power transfer during\nnormal operating mode. During this mode, the active power\nreference is given by (3). This includes the ST LV AC bus active\npower and the power transfer requirement.

Ktr is 1 when MVDC active power transfer\nis activated depending upon the condition explained in Fig. 2\nand Ktr is 0 when there is no active power transfer.\nDuring emergency mode, when microgrid MV AC grid or\nST-1 MV converter failure condition, P∗\nstmv1 = 0. During the\nMV AC main grid or ST-2 MV converter failure, the P∗\nstmv1\nand Q∗\nstmv1 are given as,\nP∗\nstmv1 = Plv1−net ; Q∗\nstmv1 = 0.

The reference (V ∗\nmdc1) and measured (Vmdc1)\nMVDC bus voltages are compared and the error is passed\nthrough a proportional integral (PI) controller to generate Pls1.\nHowever, for the normal operation, the dc link is controlled\nby the ST-2 MV converter. The constant Kl = 0 during the\nentire normal mode of operation. Kl = 1 only when the ST-\n2 MV converter dc bus voltage control fails due to the ST-2\nMV converter or MV AC main grid failure. The constant kQ1\ncontrols the reactive power injection to the respective buses\nand is given by,\nkQ1 = Q∗\nstmv1\n√\n3(P∗\nstmv1 + KlPls1).

ST -2 MV Converter\nThe ST-2 works as a secondary power controller (SPC).\nDuring normal operation, the ST-2 MV converter reference\nactive power is given by (5). In addition, during emergency\nmode of operation with ST-1 MV converter or MV AC mi-\ncrogrid failure, P∗\nstmv2 is also given by (5). When ST-2 MV\nconverter or MV AC main grid fails,P∗\nstmv2 is given as zero. In\nall conditions, the reactive power exchange (Q ∗\nstmv2) is zero.\nSimilar to the ST-1 MV converter, the three-phase reference\ncurrents (i∗\nm2−abc) for ST-2 MV converter is given as,\ni∗\nm2−a = vp\nm2−a + kQ2(vp\nm2−b −vp\nm2−c)\n(vp\nm2−a)2 + (vp\nm2−b)2 + (vp\nm2−c)2 (P∗\nstmv2 + Pls2)\ni∗\nm2−b = vp\nm2−b + kQ2(vp\nm2−c −vp\nm2−a)\n(vp\nm2−a)2 + (vp\nm2−b)2 + (vp\nm2−c)2 (P∗\nstmv2 + Pls2)\ni∗\nm2−c = vp\nm2−c + kQ2(vp\nm2−a −vp\nm2−b)\n(vp\nm2−a)2 + (vp\nm2−b)2 + (vp\nm2−c)2 (P∗\nstmv2 + Pls2)\n(10)\nwhere vp\nm2−abc are fundamental positive sequence three-phase\nmain grid MV AC bus voltages and P∗\nstmv2 is the reference\npower depending upon the mode of operation. Pls2 is the\nMVDC bus power loss component generated to maintain the\nnominal dc bus voltage. The reference (V ∗\nmdc2) and measured\n(Vmdc2) MVDC bus voltages are compared and the error\nis passed through a PI controller to generate Pls2. The PI\ncontroller parameters are tuned using symmetrical optimum\nmethod [26]. The constant kQ2 controls the reactive power\ninjection to the respective buses and is given by,\nkQ2 = Q∗\nstmv2\n√\n3(P∗\nstmv2 + Pls2). (11)\nThe reference currents generated in (10) are used with a PWM\ncontroller to generate necessary switching pattern.\nC. ST dc-dc Converter\nFor both ST-1 and ST-2, the dc-dc converters ensure the\nconstant power ﬂow between MVDC and LVDC buses. This\nis ensured by maintaining LVDC bus voltage at the constant\nreference value. The measured LVDC bus voltage (V ldci) is\ncompared with the reference value (V ∗\nldci). The error is passed\nthrough a PI controller to generate a reference phase angle\n(δ∗\ni). This phase angle is maintained between the MVDC and\nLVDC side converter switching instances. Maintaining this\nphase shift ensures the required power ﬂow is exchanged\nbetween MVDC and LVDC buses [23]. The block-diagram\nrepresentation is shown in Fig. 4(c).\nD. ST LV Converter\nA three-phase balanced sinusoidal voltage is required at the\nST LV AC bus for both ST-1 and ST-2.

P ERFORMANCE COMPARISON\nIn this section, the performance of the proposed system is\ncompared with different existing solutions [7], [8], [21], [22].\nReactive power capability and active power loss are explained\nbelow. Different system parameters considered are given in\nTable I and Table II.\nA. Reactive Power Capability\nReactive power capability of microgrid is an important\nfeature to ensure the necessary voltage support and stability.\nIn the conventional ac microgrid shown in Fig. 1(a), the DG\nconverter can be utilized with full capacity to provide reactive\npower support. During this time the active power exchange\nfrom DG needs to be reduced to zero. The reactive power\navailability is given as,\nQDG1 = SDG1 (12)\nwhere QDG1 is the reactive power rating of DG and SDG1 is\nthe rating of DG.\nIn the second case, the ac system shown in Fig. 1(b)\nis considered. The reactive power availability ( Qtot1) at the\nMV AC microgrid bus is given by,\nQtot1 = SDG1 + SBTB1 (13)\nwhere SBTB1 is the rating of BTB converter. Here, the DG-1\ncapacity is also considered for reactive power support.\nIn the third case, an ST based microgrid is considered\nwithout MVDC interconnection as shown in Fig. 1(c). The\nreactive power availability from ST-1 MV converter is given\nby,\nQmv1 =\n√\nS2\nmv1−rat −P2\nllv1 (14)\nwhere Smv1−rat is the rating of ST-1 MV converter and Pllv1\nis the loading on the LV AC bus.\nIn the proposed system shown in Fig. 1(d), if the ratings\nare considered similar to the ST system without MVDC\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel.

(16)\nThe reactive power availability in microgrid MV AC bus is\nconstant irrespective of the LV AC loading both in the con-\nventional ac system and ac system with BTB converters. In\naddition, generally BTB converters are rated for maximum\nactive power transfer. The percentage reactive power capability\nof ST-1 MV converter is plotted against percentage ST-1 LV AC\nloading in Fig. 5(a) for the proposed system and the ST based\nsystem without MVDC interconnection. The proposed system\nhas better reactive power capability compared to the ST system\nwithout MVDC interconnection.\nB. Active Power Loss\nActive power loss is important during the inter-feeder power\ntransfer. In the conventional ac system shown in Fig. 1(a), the\ncontrolled active power transfer is not possible. However, for\nthe system shown in Fig. 1(b), the controlled power transfer is\npossible with BTB system. The active power loss (P loss−ac)\nfor transferring the power from one feeder to other is given\nby [28],\nPloss−ac = P2\nli + Q2\nli\nV2\nbill\nRacij (17)\nwhere Pli and Qli are the load active and reactive powers\nof bus-i. Vbill is the bus-i voltage (L-L). Racij is the line\nresistance in Ohms (Ω) per kilometre.\nIn the ST system without MVDC interconnection shown in\nFig. 1(c), the controlled power transfer is not possible since the\npower is transferred through the ac system. In this case, the\nST LV converters supplies the required load reactive power\nand it is not absorbed from the other feeder. Therefore, the\nactive power loss in this case is,\nPloss−ac = P2\nli\nV2\nbill\nRacij. (18)\nIn the proposed ST based MVDC system, the controlled ac-\ntive power transfer is enabled through MVDC interconnection\nand is written as [28],\nPloss−dc = 2P2\nli\nV2\ndci\nRdcij (19)\nwhere Vdci is the MVDC link voltage at the ST-i terminal and\nRdcij is the line resistance in Ω per kilometre.\nThe percentage reduction in losses (∆P loss−perc) for the\nproposed system as compared to the ST based ac system\nwithout MVDC interconnection is given by,\n∆Ploss−perc = (1 −2V2\nbillRdcij\nV2\ndciRacij\n) ∗100.

(e) MVDC bus voltages. (f) Different\npowers.\nConsidering same ac and dc resistances, the percentage\nactive power loss reduction is nearly 40% for the proposed\nsystem. The percentage of per-kilometre active power loss\nfor a particular amount of active power transfer is calculated.\nThis quantity is plotted against the percentage active power in\nFig. 5(b) for different systems and the proposed system curve\nshows the lowest active power loss percentage.\nFor the conventional AC conﬁgurations or proposed ST\nbased system, the losses are broadly classiﬁed as, (1) device\nlosses, and (2) line losses. In this paper, the line loss com-\nparison is given, and the proposed system shows a decrease\nin losses. Currently, the three-stage ST used in this paper\nhas more device losses than the CPT. However, for the\ninterconnection of remotely located microgrids with the main\ngrid feeder require longer lines, and the line losses will become\nmore signiﬁcant in the overall losses.\nThe main features of different distribution systems are com-\npared in Table III. Both the BTB system shown in Fig. 1(b)\nand the proposed system provides high ﬂexibility in controlled\npower transfer. The continuous operation during MV AC micro-\ngrid failure is possible with short interruption in the BTB based\nsystem. The proposed system provides continuous operation\nwithout any interruption. After the failure and reconnection of\nMV AC microgrid, the DG resynchronization is not required in\nthe proposed system. From these characteristics, the proposed\nsystem shows an improved performance compared to the other\nexisting solutions.\nVI. S IMULATION RESULTS\nThe simulation analysis is carried out in PSCAD environ-\nment. Normal and emergency mode operations are shown in\nthe simulation.

Normal Mode\nIn Fig. 6 the power transfer during low-load condition of\nmicrogrid LV AC bus is demonstrated. The microgrid LV AC\nbus loading is 40% of the maximum load till t = 10 s. The\nPlv1−ll is set as 25% of the maximum load. At t = 10 s, the\nload decreases below Plv1−ll. The Popr is selected as 50% of\nthe maximum load. As discussed in the Fig. 2, the power is\ntransferred from MV AC microgrid to main grid feeder through\nMVDC line. Fig. 6(a) and (c) show the microgrid and main\ngrid feeder MV AC voltages, respectively. Fig. 6(b) and Fig.\n6(d) show the ST-1 MV and ST-2 MV converter currents and\nST-2 MV converter currents decreases after load change due\nto MVDC power transfer from microgrid. The MVDC bus\nvoltages are shown in Fig. 6(e) and ST-1 MVDC link voltage\nincreases to facilitate power transfer. Fig. 6(f) shows ST-1 and\nST-2 MV active powers, ST-1 LV AC load active power, and\nMVDC power transferred.\nB. Emergency Mode\nIn this mode, two cases are analyzed in the simulation,\nmicrogrid ST-1 MV converter failure and MV AC main grid\nsource failure.

The\nnormal operation shown in Fig. 10 exhibits the MVDC power\ntransfer based on the loading condition. Till the load change\nhappens, the ST-1 and ST-2 operate by supplying their own\nLV AC loads. As the load in ST-1 LV AC converter becomes\nlower than the limit, the active power transfer is initiated and\nthe same is visible in the Fig. 10 waveforms. The ST-2 MV AC\ncurrents decreases as seen in Fig. 10(d), since a portion of the\nST-2 loads are supplied from microgrid through the MVDC\nline. Different active powers are shown in Fig. 10(f).\nFig. 11 and Fig. 12 show the operation during emergency\ncondition. In the ﬁrst case, the ST-1 MV converter fails due\nto the converter fault and the ST-2 MV converter supplies\nthe ST-1 LV AC loads through the MVDC bus. The dc link\nvoltage of ST-2 remains high to facilitate the transfer. This\ncase is exhibited in waveforms shown in Fig. 11(a)-(f). The\nFig. 12(a)-(f) show the MV AC main grid failure condition.\nIn this case, the MV AC grid failure is visible in the voltage\nwaveforms shown in Fig. 12(c) and the microgrid support the\nST-2 LV AC load through the MVDC line.\nVIII.
