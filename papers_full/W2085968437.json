Introduction \nThe cosmetics industry achieved stupendous growth within a short span of time and is \nnow a multi-billion dollar industry. It would continue to grow as long as people are ready \nto spend a fortune to look their best. Realizing the potential in the cosmetics i ndustry, \nmore and more players are now joining the cosmetics bandwagon to get a slice of an ever -\ngrowing pie. The result of which is large number of brands and twice the number of \ncosmetic products in both hair and skin care. Cosmetics are defined by the U .S. Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) as an “articles intended for beautifying, cleansing, promoting \nattractiveness or altering appearance”. \n Makeup can do wonders for women , but it can be dan gerous to their health, if  not \nhandled properly [1 , 2]. Cosmetic contamination leads to several types of infections that \nrange in severity from mild to serious [ 3]. Cosmetic contamination awareness is even \n                                                 \n*Corresponding author: miqtedar@yahoo.com \n524 Incidence of Human             Short Communication \n \nworse among the younger age. Many women even share makeup and applicators with \nfriends and their family, increasing their chances of facial infection. Makeup can easily be \ncontaminated by the repetitive use to the skin using an applicator, or finger and al so by \npoor handling procedures during manufacturing that can cause defects in the preservative \ncapacities [2]. The rich texture of cosmetic creams are mainly due to moisture content, \npresence of essential minerals and growth factors, which provides a broad spectrum of \ninorganic and organic compounds and a suitable environment for the growth of \nmicroorganisms [4,5] . \nCosmetician uses a variety of beauty accessories like tweezers, scissors, and variety of \nbrushes sponges for makeup application and for skin ca re treatments  [6]. Body waxing \nenhances a risk of infection transmission both to the esthetician and clients. Quality and \ninappropriate label description of makeup also controls the contamination [ 7]. Skin \npathogenicity due to repetitive use of salon tools has gained tremendous intimidation  over \nthe past several  years. Microbial spoilage can be caused by bacteria, fungi and yeast \nwhich are extremely versatile in their metabolic activity. In spite of this relatively few  \naccounts of microbial degradation of cosmetic or pharmaceutical has been published \n[8].The present study focuses on isolation and detection of human skin pathogens ,  \nStaphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and fungi on selective media for the \nassessment of microbes contaminating the tools used in beauty salons [9]. \n \n2. Material and Methods \nSampling: Total 100 samples of makeup sponge, brush and wax was taken from 33 \ndifferent beauty salons of Lahore City from April to June, 2010. All the samples were \nanalyzed for microbial contamination at Zoology Science Research Lab of Lahore College \nfor Women University Lahore, (LCWU). \nMedia: Mannitol salt agar (Merck), Cetrimide agar (Lab M)  and Potato dextrose agar \n(Merck) were used for the enumeration of S.  aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungi. \nMedia were prepared according to manufacturers details.  A serial dilution for each sample \nwas spread on respective media plates and later  incubated at 37°C for overnight. CFU/ml \nof sample was calculated as described by [10]. \n \nStatistical Analysis: For statistical analysis, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied \nusing SPSS version 13.0 using 0.005 level of significance. \n \n3. Results and Discussion \nIn the present study, 100 samples of in use makeup sponge, blusher brush and  wax were \nobserved for microbial contamination of Staphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas \naeruginosa, yeast and fungus. Sponge and brush samples had 100% S. aureus \ncontamination, while 88%  contamination for the similar pathogen from the wax samples \nwas observed (Fig.1, Table 1).  \nThe percentage of P. aeruginosa contamination among all areas in the makeup sponge, \nbrush and wax samples was 69.6, 81.8 and 73.5%, respectively  (Fig. 1, Table 1) . Almost \n51.5% of the total sponge samples revealed fungal and yeast colonies, while 30.3 and \n20.5% contamination was observed in brush and wax samples, respectively. Sponge \nS. Naz et al. J. Sci. Res. 4 (2), 523-527 (2012) 525 \n \nsamples studied from different saloons showed high Staphylococcus aureus contamina tion \n(24.24×104 CFU/ml) from all the areas studied.  \n \nTable 1.

Low temperature \nand moist conditions are favorable to Staphylococcus aureus  growth and since majority of \nthe functions are arranged mostly during winter season, cosmeticians repeated use of \nsponge applicator and other tools causes the surging growth of these pathogens [11, 12] . \n \n \nFig. 1.

While the maximum \ncontaminants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was estimated to be 21.52 ×10 4 CFU/ml. Yeast \nand fungal growth were 20.06×104 CFU/ml. Cosmeticians have to treat a large number of \ncostumers in a limited time, the repeated use of same brush to apply facial makeup causes \nspread of microbial contamination as these pathogens are reported to adhere to the poly \n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n100000\n1000000\ns.sa sp sf b.sa bp bf wsa wp wf\nCFU/ml\nType of samples\narea1 area 2 area 3 area 4 area 5\n526 Incidence of Human             Short Communication \n \n(ethylene oxide) -PEO brush coatings very well [13]. In the wax samples the estimated \ncontamination of Staphylococcus aureus  was 25×10 3 CFU/ml. While for Pseudomonas \naeruginosa counts obtained were 26.55x10 4 CFU/ml but yeast and fungal contamination \nobtained was 120x104 CFU/ml. \nIn the present study S.aureus  contamination was seen in large number for all three \ntypes of salon tools that are frequently used. Many authors have reported the isolation of \npathogens from different parts of the face, in one such study [14], Staphylococcus aures \ncounts obtained from eyelashes ranged from 0±0 to ( 8±0.43) ×104 CFU/ml and for E.c oli \nranged from (1±0.13) ×104 to (7±0.12)×104 CFU/ml. It was also reported that cosmetics \nitems in possession of persons harbor Staphylococcus aureus in foundation samples \nranged from 0 to ( 6±0.7)×104 CFU/ml and for E.c oli it ranged from 0 ±0 to \n(9.2±0.52)×105CFU/ml. Similarly on eye shadow samples, Staphylococcus aureus \npresence ranged from 0 ±0 to (1.9±0.47)×106 CFU/ml and E.coli from 0±0 to \n(8.6±4.2)×105 CFU/ml. Inadequate preservation or outdated products can lead to microbial \ndeterioration and also favors growth and proliferation of skin pathogens after use  [15, 16]. \nMany authors have reported the presence of coagulase -positive Staphylococcus in \nunpreserved cosmetic products after use, lending importance to adequate preservation  [17, \n11]. Ashour et al.  [3] have reported several pathogens such as S. aureus  and P. \naeruginosa, as well as coliforms, recovered from some of the toothpastes. Staphylococcus  \nspp. contamination in the samples of both talcum powders and body lotions were detected \nin refs. [18] and [19].  Behravan et al. [20] have reported the incidence of contamination \nby Gram -positive bacteria, Bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus  was higher for used \ncosmetic creams which was 54%, 38% and 8%, respectively. Many other authors have \nalso reported contamination of cosmetic products with skin pathogens [ 16, 21]. Cosmetic \napplicators can be an instrument of accidental trauma that introduces potentially \nhazardous microorganisms [22] . It was also reported from the examination of cosmetics \nafter microbial spoilage that  P. aeruginosa  and Enterobacter gergoviae  were the most \npredominant bacteria in large number [23, 24]. \nFrom the present study it can be concluded that repetitive  use of saloon tools harbors  \nlarge number of pathogens that can cause serious skin infections. By adapting the proper \npreventive precautions such as  sterilization and proper washing of these tools the \nmicrobial contamination from one person to other can be controlled. \n \nReferences       \n \n1.
