Simultaneously, the \nnumber of older adults with chronic diseases has also \nincreased, with 31.7% of the 9,432 older adults in China \nin 2015 having had one or more chronic diseases [2]. US \nstudies have found that older adults with major chronic \nconditions—such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and \nchronic respiratory disease—have a higher incidence \nof disability in activities of daily living [3]. This increase \nin the aging population has added to the burden on the \nsocial welfare system, with the US spending an additional \n$135.7 billion from 1996 to 2013 [4]. Recently, US Medi -\ncare and Medicaid Services reported that due to an aging \npopulation, the proportion of national health expendi -\ntures exceeded 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \n2016 and will reach 19.4% (approximately $6 trillion) of \nGDP by 2027 [5].\nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  dlmin20@wku.ac.kr\n4 Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, Wonkwang University, 460, \nIksandae‑ro, 54538 Iksan, Jeonbuk, Republic of Korea\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 12Kim et al. BMC Health Services Research         (2022) 22:1376 \nNursing homes are care facilities where older adults \nwith physical or cognitive disabilities live while receiving \nprofessional support until death, with approximately 70% \nof people with dementia in the US receiving care during \ntheir final stages of life in such facilities [6, 7]. To improve \nand maintain the quality of care in these nursing homes, \nmany countries around the world have devised quality \nindicators and implemented institutional evaluations, \noften fusing the concepts of quality of care and patient \nsafety [8]. Most nursing home quality indicators include \nphysical and mental safety indicators for residents, such \nas falls, severe pain, bedsores, urinary tract infections, \nphysical restraints, premature death, emergency room \npresentations, delirium/dementia, weight loss/malnutri -\ntion, and drug-related events [8–10].\nSeveral studies have reported that organizational cul -\nture emphasizing the importance of quality improvement \nand patient safety is an important factor that influences \nthe care quality of nursing homes [11, 12]. An analysis of \nthe relationship between patient safety culture (PSC) and \nnursing home ratings in 186 nursing homes across the US \nin 2016 reported that PSC significantly affected health -\ncare quality [11]. Another survey of 1,447 facility manag -\ners working in 818 nursing homes found that higher PSC \nresulted in fewer customer complaints and lower fines \n[12].\nHowever, some studies have reported that organiza -\ntional culture or climate for patient safety did not actu -\nally improve residents’ quality indicators [13, 14]. To the \nbest of our knowledge, there has been no consensus on \nthe factors affecting patient safety among nursing home \nresidents. Another peculiarity is that different tools are \nused to measure the same patient-safety-related con -\ntent. In a study that measured PSC in 2017, the Nursing \nHome Survey on Patient Safety Culture (NHSPSC) tool \nwas employed [15], but in a Norwegian study in 2016, the \nSafety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) tool was employed \n[16]. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to (1) review \nprevious studies on patient safety of older adults living \nin nursing homes, (2) analyze the tools used to meas -\nure patient safety, and (3) identify the factors affecting \npatient safety of older adult residents in nursing homes. \nThe results of the study will contribute to devising strate -\ngies to improve their quality of life.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nThe review process was made in line with PRISMA \nguidelines [17]. A literature search was conducted using \nthe following databases: EMBASE, PubMed, CIHNAL, \nand COCHRANE. The main search terms were “nurs -\ning home” or “skilled nursing facility” or “long-term care \nfacility” and “safety” or “patient safety. ” Articles published \nat any time and in any country were considered. To \ndevelop a comprehensive search strategy, an effort was \nmade to ensure that there were no documents that could \npotentially be missed in the database search. This was \nensured by performing a search using terms from Medi -\ncal Subject Headings or keywords mentioned in the ref -\nerences related to patient safety.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nThe following criteria for inclusion in the literature \nreview were used: nursing home participants, topics \nrelated to patient safety or safety, focusing on primary \nresearch, and English publications. Exclusion criteria \nwere short-term residential care homes, visit home care, \ngray literature, instrument development, scoping review, \nand literature that did not use instruments to measure \npatient safety in nursing homes.\nStudy selection\nWe handled literature using a literature management \nprogram EndNote 20 version (The EndNote Team, 2013, \nPhiladelphia, PA, Clarivate) [18]. After discarding dupli -\ncate articles using the software, two researchers (JL and \nDK) independently conducted the selection and exclu -\nsion processes. The two researchers conducted all titles \nand abstract sifting for half of the papers and continued \nto share opinions. Disagreements between the research -\ners were resolved through discussion. The discussion \ncontinued until an agreement was reached. In addition, \nby placing different researchers in charge at each stage, \nwe checked each other’s results.\nData extraction and analysis\nTwo authors (DM and KK) validated the extracted data \nand resolved any disagreements. Previous literature on \ndata selection was referred to in a systematic literature \nreview [19], and a structured format was developed to \nensure uniformity of the extracted data. Data on the fol -\nlowing were extracted using data-charting forms: first \nauthor’s last name, publication year, country, sample size, \nstudy design, population, tool of measurement, qual -\nity assessment scores, study aim, and main result. The \nextracted data were then synthesized to summarize and \ninvestigate the current status of tool use, related factors, \nand implications for patient safety in nursing homes. The \nsynthesized data are presented in tables describing the \ncharacteristics of the selected studies and their outcomes.\nIn addition, this study analyzed other tools based on \nthe domain of HSOPSC version 1.0. HSOPSC is a reli -\nable and valid tool developed by Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality (AHRQ). The tool was modified \nto version 2.0 in 2019 after releasing version 1.0 in \n2004 [20], but version 1.0 is still used in many studies \nPage 3 of 12\nKim et al. BMC Health Services Research         (2022) 22:1376 \n \n[21, 22]. It consists of the following 12 domains; Com -\nmunication openness; Feedback and communication \nabout error; Teamwork within units; Non-punitive \nresponse to error; Organizational learning; Super -\nvisor/manager expectations and actions promoting \npatient safety; Staffing; Teamwork across units; Hand -\noffs and transitions; Management support for patient \nsafety; Frequency of events reported; Overall percep -\ntions of safety [23].\nQuality assessment\nTwo authors (KK and DM) assessed the quality of each \nselected study using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool \n(CCAT) version 1.4 [24]. The CCAT is a validated \ninstrument that has been widely used in systematic \nreviews. The study design that is used does not affect \nthe assessment. All categories had to be scored; the \nlowest score for a category is 0 and the highest score \nis 5. At first, the agreement between authors for 25 \npapers was 88%. Any potential discrepancies that may \narise during this process were resolved through discus -\nsion among the authors.\nResults\nA total of 13,586 articles were identified in the primary \nsearch: EMBASE returned 3,458 articles; PUBMED \n4,374; CIHNAL 4,661; and COCHRANE 1,093. After \ndiscarding 2,521 duplicate papers, we performed a selec -\ntion and exclusion process for 11,065 papers. In the first \nand second selection and exclusion rounds, 10,214 arti -\ncles were excluded after reading their titles and, following \nthe third and fourth rounds, a further 739 articles were \nexcluded after reviewing the abstracts. After review -\ning the original text and excluding 71 papers that did \nnot meet the selection criteria of this study, 41 papers \nremained. Among them, 25 papers were included in the \nfinal analysis, excluding 16 that did not include the use of \npatient safety tools (Fig. 1).\nCharacteristics of the selected studies\nTable. 1 presents the detailed characteristics of the 25 \nstudies included in this systematic review. The NHSPSC \nand the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture \n(HSOPSC) were used in 10 [11–13, 15, 25–30] and nine \nstudies [21, 22, 31–37], respectively. In addition, the \nNHSPSC-China, Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), \nSafety Attitudes Questionnaire in a Skilled Nursing \nFig. 1 Process of literature selection\nPage 4 of 12Kim et al.

BMC Health Services Research         (2022) 22:1376 \n \n[26], China [32], the Netherlands [41], and Canada [42]. \nMost were quantitative studies, and there was one mixed \nstudy [42]. With regard to the participants, one study \nincluded long-stay nursing home residents with demen -\ntia [29], five studies targeted or included administrators \n[12, 15, 27, 34, 36], and the rest were conducted among \nfacility staff working at nursing homes (registered nurses \n[RNs], certified nursing assistant [CNAs], nurse aides, \ndirect care staff, and support staff). Minimal variation \nwas noticed in the quality of the studies assessed using \nCCAT, with scores ranging from 36 (36/40, 90%) to 40 \n(40/40, 100%) out of a total of 40 (100%) points.\nComparison of the differences between tools\nAs shown in Table.  2, all the tools used in the selected \nstudies were analyzed to assess whether the PSC ele -\nments—based on the elements included in the HSOPSC \nversion 1.0—were met. The results revealed that there \nwas no “frequency of reported incidents” in the NHSPSC; \nthus, “procedure compliance” was added. The SAQ \ntool did not have “communication openness, ” “feedback \nand communication on errors, ” “non-punitive response \nto errors, ” “organizational learning, ” “employee place -\nment, ” “transition and transition, ” or “overall awareness \nof safety;” instead, it measured “job satisfaction, ” “work -\ning conditions, ” and “stress recognition. ” The MSI tool \nconsists of seven areas, and compared to the HSOPSC, \n“Management expectations and actions promoting \npatient safety” and “Overall perceptions of safety” are \nincluded. In addition, more emphasis is placed on safety \nsuch as “Perceived State of Safety” and “Senior Leader -\nship Support for Safety. “ Overall, factor 3 of “Teamwork \nwithin units, “ factor 8 of “Teamwork across units, “ and \nfactor 10 of “Management support for resident safety” \nwere included in all tools, except for the MSI tool, while \nfactor 6 of “Management expectations and actions pro -\nmoting patient safety” was included in all tools. On the \nother hand, factor 11 of “Frequency of events reported” \nwas not included in other tools except for the HSOPSC \ntool. Its Cronbach’s alpha reliability was reported to \nrange between 0.7 and 0.90.\nPatient safety culture differences between hospitals \nand nursing homes\nThe PSC scores of nursing homes and hospitals differed \nslightly in terms of their subdomains, although most \nstudies reported that nursing home scores were low [22, \n28, 34, 36, 37]. However, one study reported that nurs -\ning homes also had higher scores than hospitals in some \ndomains [28]. The PSC score was higher for RNs and \nCNAs in hospitals with low turnover rates [15]. While \neach increase in the overall positive response rate to PSC \nreported a decrease in medical defects (p = .001), proven \ncomplaints (p = .004), and fines (p = .059), there was an \nincrease in the probability of being assigned a 4- or 5-star \nquality rating [12]. However, studies using the NHSPSC \nreported no sub-factors significantly associated with \n5-star ratings [11]. People living with dementia in the \nnursing home group had a lower risk of in-hospital death, \nas their openness to communication regarding their PSC \nscores was higher [29]. The results reveal that higher \nPSC scores among CNAs are reflected by patients’ falls, \nfor which modulated restraint use was reported [21]. In \naddition, increasing age and job position were associated \nwith significantly higher mean scores for patient safety \nfactors (teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfac -\ntion, and working conditions) [40].\nPatient safety culture differences between employees\nConsidering the factors influencing nurses in terms of \nPSC, the PSC questionnaires reveal that the scores of \nCNAs were lower than those of RNs [41], while nurse \nmanagers reported higher scores than staff nurses [35, \n36]. Licensed nurses employed in government-run estab -\nlishments had significantly lower awareness of a posi -\ntive safety culture than did nurses employed in nonprofit \norganizations [35]. RNs, licensed practical nurses, and \nnurse management/supervisors received the highest rat -\nings for quality of collaboration and communication \n(very high), whereas nurse practitioners and physician \nassistants received the lowest ratings (range: 2.5–2.9) \n[38].\nFactors affecting patient safety\nAs shown in Table.  3, factors affecting patient safety \nincluded transformational leadership, job demands, job \nresources [30], facility ownership (p < .001), facility scale \n(p < .001), reporting management (p < .001) [40], being an \nintegrated care institution or not (p = .006), frequency \nof concern about patient safety (p = .001), occurrence of \nadverse events in departments (p = .001), and a punitive \natmosphere [32]. One study reported a positive correla -\ntion between teamwork climate, job satisfaction, per -\nceptions of management, safety climate, and working \nconditions [37]. In this study, the explanatory power was \n42.7%, with staffing and communication openness being \nsignificant predictors [31].\nDiscussion\nThis review aimed to investigate the factors affecting \npatient safety in older adults living in nursing homes \nby reviewing previous studies on patient safety in nurs -\ning homes. The synthesis of the 25 papers identified \nrevealed that most of the tools used to measure patient \nsafety in nursing homes were related to PSC and \nemployees’ attitudes.

BMC Health Services Research         (2022) 22:1376 \nwere found to be associated with lower reported medi -\ncal defects [8 , 11, 12].\nPSC was found to be an important factor affecting \nthe safety of nursing home residents. These findings \nare consistent with existing studies on the effect of PSC \non patient safety as an organizational factor [21, 29]. \nThis study is particularly meaningful in that it system -\natically analyzed the tools developed for nursing homes \n(NHSPSC), unlike previous studies that reported that \nthe HSOPSC was the only tool to measure PSC in nurs -\ning homes in 2008 [21]. The selected literature used the \nHSOPSC tool developed for hospitals until the AHRQ \npublished the NHSPSC in 2009 to measure PSC in \nnursing homes [33]. However, even after its publica -\ntion, although nursing homes were the focus of several \nstudies, HSOPSCs were used for comparison with hos -\npitals [36, 37, 41].\nThis study revealed that nursing homes generally \nscored lower than hospitals when using the HSOPSC to \nmeasure PSC. The authors attribute this to a dimension \nrelated to error reporting. In the case of the US, the fed -\neral government is required to report abuses, injuries \nof an unknown source, mistreatment, among others, of \nresidents in nursing homes [43], but this is not included \nin the dimension of the NHSPSC tool. According to the \nresults reported by 173 Swedish nursing homes in 2018, \n89% of serious adverse reactions occurred due to medi -\ncation errors, falls, delays or improper interventions, \nand neglect of care [44]. Therefore, a system for the \noccurrence of accidents in nursing homes is important, \nfor which the NHSPSC tool may have to be modified in \nthe future.\nIn addition, the differences in PSC scores between \nhospitals and nursing homes may reflect the person -\nnel composition and characteristics between the two \nsettings. Unlike hospitals, nursing homes often pro -\nvide residents with care through nurse assistants or \ncare workers rather than RNs [22]. Many studies have \nreported that the higher the number of RNs, the bet -\nter the patient safety and quality indicators [45, 46]. \nIn 2014, 11,339 nursing homes across the US investi -\ngated the inappropriate use of antipsychotic drugs in \nboth mentally ill and normal groups of patients [47]. \nIncreasing the number of hours of direct care provided \nby a nurse assistant instead of by an RN was found to \nincrease the use of psychotropic drugs, sounding a \nwarning about the decrease in the number of RNs. \nAlthough the dimension of “procedure compliance” \nwas added to NHSPSC due to the different personnel \ncomposition, a program providing better education to \nthose who provide direct care to residents is not only \nneeded but will also be more valuable in ensuring bet -\nter PSC.\nIn the US, nursing home evaluations of quality indi -\ncators, such as falls, severe pain, pressure sores, urinary \ntract infections, and physical restraints, have been pub -\nlished on a public website [48]. South Korea also con -\nducts quality assessments of nursing homes, with most \nstudies focusing on structures and processes and failing \nto include health outcomes for residents [49]. Although \ninformation on the overall facility, including the num -\nber of RNs, has been disclosed, it does not address the \nquality and safety of care at the facility. Moreover, in \nKorean nursing homes with fewer RNs, the number of \nRNs did not affect the quality of care indicators [50]. \nWith the development of the Korean PSC tool in 2013 \n[51], interest in patient safety in nursing homes has \nincreased. Therefore, in future research, it is necessary \nto develop an evaluation system and tool to compre -\nhensively evaluate and measure patient safety in nurs -\ning homes, including PSC.\nThis study has several limitations. First, since this \nonly considered studies that used tools, the results \nshould be cautiously interpreted because studies that \nemployed other designs without the use of tools were \nexcluded. Second, this study compared the tools used \nin each literature with the version 1.0 domain of the \nHSOPSC tool. Since version 2.0 has been released, it \nis necessary to compare them in future studies. Third, \nsince all articles were in English, important articles \npublished in other languages may have been over -\nlooked. Finally, a meta-analysis could not be performed \nbecause the literature analyzed in this study was \nreported using various tools and considering different \nresults. It is necessary for future research to present \nquantitative evidence for studies that report findings \nbased on using the same tools.\nConclusion\nThis study revealed that the PSC of nursing homes is \na critical factor that influences the safety of their resi -\ndents. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen organi -\nzational factors, such as the staff education system and \nthe composition of appropriate personnel, for estab -\nlishing and fostering a PSC in nursing homes, for which \npolicy support is also essential.\nAbbreviations\nAHRQ: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; CCAT : Crowe Critical \nAppraisal Tool; CNAs: certified nursing assistants; HSOPSC: Hospital Survey on \nPatient Safety Culture; MSI: Modified Stanford Patient Safety Culture Survey \nInstrument; NH: nursing home; NHSPSC: Nursing Home Survey on Patient \nSafety Culture; PSC: Patient Safety Culture; RNs: registered nurses; SAQ: Safety \nAttitudes Questionnaire; SAQ‑AV: Ambulatory Version of the Safety Attitudes \nQuestionnaire; SAQ‑SNF: Safety Attitudes Questionnaire in a Skilled Nursing \nFacility.\nPage 11 of 12\nKim et al.
