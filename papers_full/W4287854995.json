Compared with five existing meth-\nods in three human values alignment datasets,\nSENSEI not only achieves higher alignment per-\nformance in terms of both automatic and hu-\nman evaluations, but also shows improvements\non robustness and transfer learning on unseen\nhuman values.\n1 Introduction\nPre-trained language models (LMs) have been\nshown to capture rich semantic and syntactic fea-\ntures, as demonstrated by their state-of-the-art per-\nformance on many down-stream tasks such as read-\ning comprehension (Clark et al., 2019; Mihaylov\net al., 2018), commonsense QA (Kwiatkowski\net al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2017), few-shot (Gao\net al., 2021; Schick and Schütze, 2021), and zero-\nshot settings (Wei et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2020).\nThese models obtain such ability via training on\nLM\nCritic\nActor\nContext Response\nHuman Demonstrations\nFigure 1: SENSEI aligns LM generation with human\nvalues by 1) learning how to distribute human rewards\ninto each step of language generation with a Critic, and\n2) guiding the generation towards the direction that has\nmaximum estimated reward with an Actor. Both Critic\nand Actor are MLP layers plus the shared LM.\nlarge amount of unsupervised data: for exam-\nple, Google’s T5 was trained on the 800GB C4\ndataset (Raffel et al., 2019), while OpenAI’s GPT-\n3 was trained on 45TB of text data collected from\nthe Web (Brown et al., 2020). Considering the\ncost of human labor, these datasets are normally\nnot carefully filtered for ethical considerations, but\nsimply cleaned by removing surface-level “bad”\nwords via automated tools1. Trained on these uncu-\nrated datasets with a language modeling objective\n(e.g., MLE), existing LMs are reported to be easily\nmisguided to generate toxic (Gehman et al., 2020),\nbiased (Liu et al., 2021c; Sheng et al., 2019a), and\nimmoral content (Emelin et al., 2021).\nPre-trained LMs fail to properly capture human\nvalues even when fine-tuned. Table 1 shows three\nexamples extracted from recently released human\n1In the official introduction page of C4 dataset, the de-\nscribed cleaning procedure includes removing duplication,\nbad words, etc. Evidently, no human judgement is involved.\nSee: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4\n242\nQuery [MS/HHH/TQA] Options LLM\nMiles needed help getting to the airport\nin a wheelchair.

We find MLE fine-tuned GPT-2 can hardly choose the proper option\nby choosing the one with lower LM loss (LLM), which demonstrates that solely language modeling is not sufficient\nto model human values.\nvalues alignment benchmark datasets. Given a\nquery describing a particular context, the fine-tuned\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) (via MLE training on\nthe dataset) still fails to pick the human-preferred\noptions by choosing the option with lower language\nmodeling loss (i.e., LLM): In the QA task that re-\nquires trustful answers (TQA), the fine-tuned LM\nstill replies with a fictional address even though\nthe query explicitly says “In real life, ...”. Similar\nproblems also exist in the other two examples, and\nin general in cases where the option not preferred\nby humans is also semantically coherent.\nThough ever-larger LMs are capable of learning\nmore knowledge from the physical world, embed-\nding human values judgements into such systems\nremains an outstanding challenge without many\nconcrete strategies (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Given\nthat text generated by these models is becoming\nubiquitous in everyday applications (and these text\ncould unintentionally be included in the next itera-\ntion of LM training data collection), it is of utmost\nsocietal importance to develop better training strate-\ngies that can guide LMs to generate prosocial text,\nas supported by recent calls by human-centered AI\nresearchers (Blodgett et al., 2020).\nSince manual curation of the training datasets for\nthese LMs is not scalable, we propose a new train-\ning strategy to address this problem. In this paper,\nwe consider the alignment problem from a contex-\ntual perspective: given a context 𝑥, how to teach\nan LM to generate text 𝑦that is not only coherent\nto the context, but also more likely to be preferred\nby humans, in accordance with some shared hu-\nman values, such as morality, non-toxicity, etc.?\nTypically, the instances in the alignment datasets\ncome with a context (𝑥), and a set of human demon-\nstrations (𝑦, including positive 𝑦+and negative 𝑦−).\nThe goal of alignment is to teach the LM to learn\nfrom the value-aligned demonstrations and penal-\nize the non-aligned ones, and extend this judgement\nability to unseen contexts.\nTo this end, we present SENSEI , a new LM train-\ning framework that is able to align LM generation\nwith human values. As shown in Figure 1, we first\ntrain a human reward machine 𝑓 that can output\nscalar reward for a given context + generation input\n(i.e., (𝑥+𝑦)), and decompose the alignment goal\ninto two learning objectives: 1) learning a reward\ndistributor that can assign the scalar human reward\nto different parts of 𝑦(Critic), and 2) guiding the\ngeneration towards the direction that can maximize\nestimated reward (Actor).\nThe advantages of SENSEI are three-fold. First,\nSENSEI better aligns with human values. We apply\nSENSEI to three alignment datasets, and demon-\nstrate that, compared with five baseline methods,\nSENSEI achieves better alignment performance in\naccuracy and language resemblance, and is robust\nin few-shot scenarios. Second, SENSEI is an of-\nfline alignment method. Requiring neither interac-\ntive human labeling, nor recursive model training,\nSENSEI runs on offline human-labeled data and\nthus is less costly and easier to deploy. Third, hu-\nman evaluations confirm the “alignment tax” of\nSENSEI is affordable. Recent studies have shown\nthat alignment with human values often comes with\nperformance deterioration in other aspects like flu-\nency, which is called the “alignment tax” (Askell\net al., 2021). We investigate this problem through\nhuman evaluations and find SENSEI can achieve\nsignificant improvement on alignment with negligi-\nble deterioration on the generation quality.\n243\n2 Approach\n2.1 Why is Alignment Hard?\nGiven a context 𝑥 (e.g., a social situation), we\nask an LM to generate a sequence of tokens 𝑦 =\n{𝑦0,𝑦1,...,𝑦 𝑡 }as the response2. The MLE training\nprocedure aims to minimize the language modeling\nloss LLM (typically via cross-entropy):\nLtrain\nLM = −E𝑦∼𝑝World\n[𝑇∑︁\n𝑡=0\nlog 𝑝LM (𝑦𝑡 |𝑦<𝑡 ,𝑥)\n]\n,\n(1)\nwhere 𝑦 ∼𝑝World denotes the data collected from\nthe open world (e.g., OpenAI’s WebText (Radford\net al., 2019)). The training goal of the LM is to\nlearn a parameterized distribution (𝑝LM) to approx-\nimate the open-world data distribution (𝑝World).\nDuring test-time inference, we evaluate how well\nthe generated text from the trained LM aligns with\nhuman values, expecting to maximize:\nLtest\nLM = E𝑦∼𝑝LM\n[𝑇∑︁\n𝑡=0\nlog 𝑝Human (𝑦𝑡 |𝑦<𝑡 ,𝑥)\n]\n, (2)\nwhere 𝑦 ∼𝑝LM now corresponds to the data dis-\ntribution that is derived from the trained LM. We\ntake the sum of log-likelihoods over the distribution\nof human-aligned references (𝑝Human) as the Ltest\nLM.\nCommon evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Pap-\nineni et al., 2002) can be viewed as approximating\nthis probability, though via token overlaps.\nComparing Eq.1 and Eq.2, we notice that the\nMLE training of LMs is minimizing a forward\nKL divergence 𝐷KL(𝑝World||𝑝LM)(Choshen et al.,\n2020)3, while the evaluation of human data align-\nment is actually rewarding minimal reverse KL\ndivergence 𝐷KL(𝑝LM||𝑝Human).\nThe challenges of aligning human values for\ngeneration can be presented as:\n1. It is hard to estimate𝑝Human from 𝑝World. Only\na small subset of the data collected from the\nworld (𝑝World) is aligned with human values\n(𝑝Human), because most of the data either does\nnot carry any human values judgement (e.g.,\n2We use 𝑦<𝑡 to denote the tokens generated before the 𝑡-th\nstep LM generation.\n3Cross-entropy loss differs from KL-divergence by a\nconstant entropy term (the entropy of real data distribution\n𝑝World), which can be essentially ignored in an optimization\nprocedure.\n“The USA is a country in North America.”) or\nnot aligned with human values (e.g., “ I will\nnever help my friends.”). An LM trained on\nthe 𝑝World with MLE has no scheme to be\naware of the preference of 𝑝Human.\n2. KL divergence is asymmetric. An LM opti-\nmized with MLE (forward KL) does not guar-\nantee good performance when evaluated with\nreverse KL, since MLE training encourages\nthe LM to put probability mass on all the data\nin the training set (i.e., be inclusive, or high\nrecall). On the other hand, the alignment crite-\nria requires the generated text from the trained\nLM to be always aligned with human values\n(i.e., be exclusive, or high precision) (Pang\nand He, 2021).\nA straight-forward solution could be training\nwith test metrics (reverse KL) directly; however,\ncomputing the term 𝐷KL(𝑝LM||𝑝Human)is practi-\ncally intractable since the concrete form of 𝑝Human\nis unknown (Pang and He, 2021). SENSEI is able\nto learn from positive demonstrations labeled by\nhumans while penalizing the generations resem-\nbling the negative ones. SENSEI is a reinforcement\nlearning based Actor-Critic framework, where we\nindirectly incorporate test metrics as part of the\nlearning objective during training, and use human\nlabels as the reward to guide the generation towards\na value-aligned direction. We describe SENSEI in\nthe following part.\n2.2 RL Formulation for Text Generation\nTo formulate text generation as an RL problem, we\ndefine the state at time 𝑡 as the generated tokens\nbefore 𝑡(i.e., 𝑠𝑡 = 𝑦<𝑡 ), and the action as the cur-\nrent step’s output token (i.e.,𝑎𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 ). The softmax\noutput of the language modeling head (i.e., a cate-\ngorical distribution 𝑝𝑡 over the entire vocabulary),\nis considered as the policy 𝜋𝑡 for picking token\n𝑦𝑡 (action 𝑎𝑡 ) given the state 𝑠𝑡 = 𝑦<𝑡 (Liu et al.,\n2021e). We also denote the context (e.g., prompt,\nscenarios, etc.) of the current generation as 𝑥.\nReward. Given a dataset with context 𝑥 and\naligned/not-aligned demonstrations (𝑦 ∈{𝑦+,𝑦−}),\nwe first assign pseudo labels {1, 0} to each type of\ndemonstration respectively. Next, we train a clas-\nsifier 𝑓 over this pseudo-labeled dataset. We take\nthe sigmoid of the log-likelihood predicted by 𝑓 as\nthe alignment reward 𝑟, which is:\n244\n𝑟 = 𝜎log(𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)𝑦∼𝑝LM ) (3)\nSince we treat aligned demonstrations as class 1,\nthe sigmoid output measures the likelihood the text\ninput (𝑥,𝑦)will be classified as aligned by humans,\nwhich essentially functions as an alignment reward.\nOne long-standing challenge of incorporating\nhuman reward into generative models is how to dis-\ntribute such “end-of-episode” reward into each step\nof language modeling training (Wu et al., 2021;\nStiennon et al., 2020). Since the reward is only\navailable when the whole sentence is generated, it\nis hard for an LM to leverage this supervision dur-\ning step-wise language modeling. To address this\nissue, instead of manually designing a set of tokens\nas “reward tokens” (i.e., control codes) (Dathathri\net al., 2020; Keskar et al., 2019), we directly use the\nLM to learn human reward distribution by adding\nan MLP head on top of the LM (GPT-2 medium in\nthis paper), which we use to guide the generation\ntowards the direction that can obtain more reward.\nThis follows the general idea of the Actor-Critic\nmethod in RL (Mnih et al., 2016; Schulman et al.,\n2015). We detail both parts as follows:\nCritic. Critic refers to the GPT-2 + MLP head\nmodel, which aims to learn an accurate reward dis-\ntributor. The MLP head is composed of an MLP\nlayer plus a dropout layer (denoted as MLP for\nsimplicity), which will project the GPT-2 hidden\nstates to a scalar at each step. The LM estimated\nreward distribution at time step 𝑡 is denoted as\n𝑉(𝑠𝑡 )= MLP(𝑝LM (𝑦𝑡 |𝑥)). We minimize a mean\nsquare error (MSE) loss between estimated reward\nand ground truth reward to force the LM + MLP\nhead to have a better estimation:\nLCritic = MSE(𝑟𝑡 −𝑉(𝑠𝑡 ))\n= MSE\n[\n𝑟−𝐷KL(𝜋ref\n𝑡 ||𝜋𝑡 )−𝑉(𝑠𝑡 )\n](4)\nNote that we incorporate a KL term between the\ncurrent policy (𝜋𝑡 ) and a policy from a reference\nLM4 (𝜋ref\n𝑡 ) as a penalty term for the reward 𝑟𝑡 so\nthat high reward via drift-away policy would be\npenalized (Schulman et al., 2017). The MLP layer\nhas a dimension of [ ℎdim, 1], where ℎdim is the\nhidden size of the specific LM (for GPT2-medium\nℎdim = 1024).\n4We take the predicted vocabulary distribution from a\nweight-frozen reference LM as the reference policy. The\nreference LM is the same type as the LM, which is GPT-2\nmedium in our experiments.\nActor. The critic will be optimized by minimiz-\ning LCritic, and the estimated reward is leveraged to\nguide the current generation. Specifically, we use\nGAE(𝜆, 𝛾) (Schulman et al., 2016) to unfold future\nreward estimation into the current step return 𝑄𝑡 :\n𝑄GAE(𝜆,𝛾)\n𝑡 =\nL∑︁\n𝑙=1\n(𝜆𝛾)𝑙 [𝑟𝑡 +𝛾𝑉(𝑠𝑡+𝑙+1))] (5)\nwhere 𝑉(𝑠𝑡 )is the value estimation from the Critic,\nand 𝑙is the length for reward unfolding (limited by\nmax sequence length 𝐿). 𝜆and 𝛾 are two hyper-\nparameters of GAE 5. Then the current policy is\ntrained to minimize the actor loss LActor:\nLActor = −𝜋𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 )\n𝜋ref\n𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 )𝑄𝑡 +𝛼log 𝜋𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 ), (6)\nwhere 𝑄𝑡 is adjusted by an importance-sampling\nratio between current and reference policy for off-\npolicy stability (Munos et al., 2016). We also add\nan entropy bonus term (log 𝜋𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 )), discounted\nby 𝛼, to encourage more exploration of current\npolicy (Haarnoja et al., 2018)6.\nThe critic loss is minimized to produce better\nestimation of reward distribution, while minimiz-\ning actor loss aims to push the generation policy\ntowards the higher reward direction. Compared\nwith MLE, the joint training procedure will not\nonly make the LM aware of human judgements so\nthat it can learn a better representation for 𝑝Human,\nbut also as we show later, improve the efficiency\nof learning in few-shot scenarios where human-\nlabeled data is scarce. Combining all the above def-\ninitions, the policy gradient procedure of SENSEI\nis summarized in Algorithm 1.\n3 Datasets and Experimental Setup\nWe study the alignment performance of our method\non three human values alignment datasets:\nMoral Stories7 The Moral Stories dataset exam-\nines whether contemporary language generation\nmodels can generate proper actions and anticipate\ncorresponding likely consequences under moral\nconstraints (Emelin et al., 2021). We combine the\nnorm, situation, and intention of each data sam-\nple as context, and treat moral actions and conse-\nquences as positive demonstrations, while immoral\n5For all experiments we use {𝜆= 0.95, 𝛾= 1}.\n6For all experiments we use 𝛼= 0.1.\n7https://github.com/demelin/moral_stories\n245\nAlgorithm 1:SENSEI Alignment\nFine-tune the LM with MLE;\nTrain a classifier 𝑓 for fine-grained reward;\nfor 𝑡 = 1,2,... do\nGenerate samples (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 )by policy 𝜋𝑡 ;\nCalculate 𝑟𝑡 , 𝑄𝑡 by Eq.3 and 5;\nUpdate current policy\n𝜋∗\n𝑡 ←arg min𝜋∗\n𝑡\n𝐽𝑡 by minimizing total\nloss 𝐽𝑡 = LCritic +LActor via Adam;\nGenerate tokens with updated policy 𝜋∗\n𝑡 ;\nend\nones as negative demonstrations (with a ratio of\n{50%, 50%} of 𝑁 = 20,000 samples in total).\nETHICS: Deontology8 The ETHICS dataset in-\nvestigates the performance of LMs on five hu-\nman values alignment tasks (e.g., justice, virtue,\netc.) (Hendrycks et al., 2021). We pick the deon-\ntology split because of its contextual nature: The\ncontexts are everyday situations (e.g., “I am taking\nmy kids to the zoo. ”), and the positive and neg-\native demonstrations are whether the reaction is\nreasonable and ethical (e.g., “So I should check the\nweather.”) or not (e.g., “ So I should bring food\nfor the animals.”), with a ratio of {54%, 46%} of\n𝑁 = 25,356 samples in total.\nRealToxicityPrompts9 RealToxicityPrompts pro-\nvides around 100k combinations of prompts + trig-\ngered GPT-2 generations to diagnose the toxicity\nwithin the pre-training data (Gehman et al., 2020).\nThe sentences are labeled with toxicity scores by\nPerspective API10. We pick those sentences whose\nprompts (context) and GPT-2 generations are both\nscored below 0.5 as positive demonstrations, and\nthose where both are scored above 0.5 as negative\ndemonstrations (with a re-balanced ratio of {50%,\n50%} of 𝑁 = 10,000 samples in total).\nWe use the official train/valid/test split of Moral\nStories and RealToxicityPrompts, and we use the\n“test hard” split as test set and “test” split as valid\nset for ETHIC: Deontology11. For pre-processing,\nwe removed hashtags and urls in the text, but leave\npunctuation and stop words. Besides the generative\n8https://github.com/hendrycks/ethics\n9https://toxicdegeneration.allenai.org\n10A widely used, commercially deployed toxicity measure-\nment tool: https://www.perspectiveapi.com.\n11The authors of ETHIC dataset claim the “test hard” split\nhas more out-of-domain samples than “test” split.\nLM (i.e., GPT-2 medium) we use throughout the pa-\nper, we train three RoBERTa-large classifiers (Liu\net al., 2019) on the pseudo-labeled datasets of the\nabove three tasks, achieving F1 scores of {95.3,\n83.2, 88.5}, respectively. These classification mod-\nels are used as judgement classifiers for alignment\naccuracy during evaluation, as well as the reward\nmachines 𝑓 during RL refinement. To measure\nperplexity (PPL), we use GPT-2 extra large. We\nrun all experiments on a machine with four RTX\nA6000 GPUs. We train for {120, 54, 21} epochs\nfor the three tasks (respectively) for the best per-\nforming SENSEI (with an early stopping condition\nof no reward increase for 3 epochs). Training takes\n{76min, 55min, 27min} for the three tasks, respec-\ntively. We run all the experiments of SENSEI with\n5 different random seeds and report the average.\nWe also consider two smaller-scale human val-\nues alignment datasets: HHH (Helpful, Honest,\n& Harmless) (Askell et al., 2021) ( 𝑁 = 178) and\nTrustful QA(Lin et al., 2021) (𝑁 = 299), to eval-\nuate the domain transfer ability of SENSEI . We\nexclude the “others” subset in the HHH dataset as\nit shows unclear human values.\n4 Evaluation\n4.1 S ENSEI Better Aligns with Human Values\nWe first study whetherSENSEI can help LMs better\nalign with human values in terms of: 1) Accuracy\nto be classified as aligned (i.e., how likely is the\ncontext + generated text aligned with human val-\nues?), 2) ROUGE-L between generated text and hu-\nman references (i.e., how much does the generated\ntext resemble the positive human demonstrations?),\nand 3) Perplexity of the context + the generated\ntext (i.e., how fluent is generated text following the\ngiven context?). We only pick the positive demon-\nstrations in the test set of each task to represent the\nground-truth that is aligned with human values.\nAs shown in Table 2, we find that SENSEI out-\nperforms all other GPT-2 based baselines (with\naffordable “alignment tax” (Askell et al., 2021) in\nperplexity), especially in the alignment accuracy\n(ACC), presumably because SENSEI learns how\nto distribute human values reward via the Critic.\nMLE-trained GPT-2 with all available data has the\nlowest perplexity, but its generation is less aligned\nsince it has no scheme to be aware of human val-\nues. Data Filtering directly clones the human data\nbehavior by only training LMs with aligned data,\nwhich results in a small improvement over MLE\n246\nTask Moral Stories ETHICS: DeontologyRealToxicityPrompts\nExisting Methods (with GPT-2 M [340M]) ACC R-L PPL↓ ACC R-L PPL ↓ ACC R-L PPL ↓\nMLE 55.8 17.9 11.4 69.8 10.2 15.6 70.3 12.4 22.5\nData Filtering 60.4 18.3 12.5 70.4 9.6 17.3 79.2 13.5 23.1\nPPLM (Constrained Decoding; 2020) 52.5 14.2 42.7 42.5 13.4 20.3 57.5 11.3 33.9\nContext-Distill (Imitation Learning; 2021) 70.1 12.5 90.1 37.6 3.7 30.7 73.1 10.0 50.3\nDialoGPT (MMI Reranking; 2020) 75.3 15.6 23.6 85.3 10.5 20.5 82.2 12.6 30.8\nOurs:SENSEI (Actor + Critic) 93.5 18.5 11.7 93.1 14.2 16.3 90.3 13.9 27.6\nOurs:SENSEI (Actor Only) 87.4 19.3 10.5 79.8 12.5 19.0 85.7 13.0 30.3\nGPT-3 (Four-shot In-context Learning) 60.5 4.6 15.7 44.4 9.2 17.3 56.0 7.3 33.2\nGPT-3 (Fine-tuned with All Data) 82.6 19.1 9.4 85.7 17.5 12.3 87.8 16.5 15.8\nTable 2: Benchmark results of SENSEI on three human values alignment tasks. Compared with prior arts, SENSEI\nimproves alignment performance by at most 24% in accuracy (ACC) and 8% in ROUGE-L (R-L), with affordable\n“alignment tax” (Askell et al., 2021) in perplexity (PPL). We also report the results of two naive methods (MLE\ntraining and Data Filtering), and GPT-3 (few-shot and fine-tuned)12 for reference. We bold the best performing and\nunderline the second best results (GPT-3 not included as it uses a much larger model (babbage, 1.3B)).\ndue to its limited generalization on the out-of-\ndomain test sets. PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2020)\nand Context-Distillation (Askell et al., 2021) limit\nthe decoding space by either static or dynamic word\nlists from the human data (obtained via an extra\nforward pass of a larger LM). Both show higher\nperplexity since their alignment control over gener-\nation is at the token level. DialoGPT (Zhang et al.,\n2020) first generates multiple candidates and re-\nranks them by a MMI (Maximum Mutual Informa-\ntion) model to pick the best continuation. SENSEI\nhas a superior performance than the other methods\npossibly because of its joint training on the Actor\nand Critic modules. We see that removing Critic\nlearning effects the alignment accuracy more than\nthan language similarity (R-L), since the Critic is\nresponsible for better estimation of the reward.\nDoes Scaling-up LM help?We further investi-\ngate whether simply scaling up LMs can improve\nhuman values alignment. As shown in Table 2,\nscaled-up GPT-3 LM still suffers low alignment\nwith human values even if we provide few-shot\ndemonstrations (two positive and two negative).\nThis demonstrates that the success of GPT-3 on\nknowledge-intensive tasks can not be fully trans-\nferred to tasks requiring value judgements (Brown\net al., 2020). Without deliberate optimization, the\nbenefit of fine-tuning GPT-3 on all data is not on\npar with SENSEI , but we find there is significant\nimprovement over MLE on GPT-2 medium, poten-\ntially owing to the enlarged model capacity (≈4x\nlarger →30% improvement).\nTask Moral Story (25% Training Data)\n+ # of Demo(s) 1 (▲)no demo 1 (▼) 2 ( ▲▼) 2 ( ▼▲)\nMLE ↑1.2930.6 ↓1.07 ↓2.17 ↑1.23\nData Filtering ↑0.1340.9 ↓1.44 ↓1.58 ↑2.19\nDialoGPT ↑0.1346.3 ↓1.44 ↓2.58 ↓1.19\nSensei(A+C) ↑0.1053.7 ↓0.07 ↓0.73 ↑0.93\nSensei(A) ↑0.1449.4 ↓0.12 ↓1.01 ↑1.11\nGPT-3 ↑0.1061.5 ↓0.20 ↑1.1 ↑3.4\nTable 3: Robustness evaluation when using in-context\ndemonstrations as prompts to query the LMs. SENSEI\n(Actor + Critic) is the most robust method (in alignment\naccuracy) under perturbation strategies on prompts, such\nas ending changing (ending in ▲positive or ▼negative\ndemonstration), and number of in-context demonstra-\ntions (two pairs v.s. one demonstration).\n4.2 S ENSEI is Robust in Few-shot Scenarios\nPrompt-based learning has been demonstrated to be\nuseful for LMs to perform well, especially in few-\nshot scenarios (Liu et al., 2021a). When provided\na prompt that contains a few demonstrations, the\nLM is more likely to recall similar data it has seen\nduring training, which is also interpreted as intro-\nducing necessary inductive bias (Gao et al., 2021;\nLiu et al., 2021a). However, such prompt-based\nlearning is reported to be non-robust: The genera-\ntion after the prompt tends to closely correlate with\nthe attribute of the demonstrations, which may be\nundesirable. For example, if we query MLE-trained\nGPT-2 with “My friend Amy is in trouble. I should\nnot help her. My mum needs my help. I should ”,\n247\nthe generation could be “not help her.”. This non-\nrobustness could lead to unethical generations, and\ncan be exploited for adversarial attacks.\nIn Table 3, we prepare several perturbation strate-\ngies on prompts to mislead few-shot trained LM\ngeneration. In general, SENSEI with both Actor\nand Critic is the least influenced method. Chang-\ning the ending demonstration seems to have sig-\nnificant influence on the alignment accuracy: the\nLM tends to generate sentences whose attribute is\nsimilar to the demonstrations near the end of the\nprompt, which can explain why negative-ending\nprompts can often lead to decrease in alignment\naccuracy (Zhao et al., 2021). More demonstrations\nhelp the in-context learning but they become more\nsignificant in zero-shot settings (see GPT-3 results).\n4.3 Values Transfer Learning of SENSEI\nSince data labeled with human values is costly and\nscarce, we explore whether the alignment on one\nvalue can be extended/transferred to another, which\ninvestigates the generalizability of SENSEI on un-\nseen values. In Figure 2 we show two transfer\nmatrices of alignment accuracy, from seen values\n(rows) to unseen ones (columns). SENSEI has bet-\nter generalization, especially in Morality (M) and\nDeontology (D), and Data Filtering seems to obtain\nmore gains on generalization from Non-Toxicity\n(N), potentially because the toxicity dataset (i.e.,\nRealToxicityPrompts) covers some of the other val-\nues in an implicit way.\n4.4 Human Evaluation\nWe conducted human evaluation on Amazon Me-\nchanical Turk (MTurk) to validate the quality of\nSENSEI alignment. In total 210 participants were\nrandomly assigned to evaluate the three tasks. Par-\nticipants (57.1% male, 41.9% female, 1% unan-\nswered) were all from the United States and above\n18 years old, with an average age of 31.5 years\nold. Each participant was paid 1 dollar for com-\npleting 16 questions in each questionnaire (average\ncompletion time per questionnaire was about 5.07\nminutes). They were properly informed that the\ncollected data would be used for research purposes\nin the consent form at the beginning.\nResults.

For readability, both SENSEI\nand baselines are rated lower than the MLE method\nbut not significantly; we take this as the tax of align-\nment. SENSEI and DialoGPT both bring benefits\nin alignment with respect to the overall ratings, but\nthe improvement from DialoGPT is not significant\nfor deontology ( 𝑝 = 0.25). These results further\nconfirm that SENSEI better aligns the generation\nwith human values with affordable “alignment tax”.\n5 Related Work\nValue Judgement in LMs. By querying LMs\nwith manually created (Petroni et al., 2019; Kass-\nner and Schütze, 2020) or automatically generated\nprompts (Shin et al., 2020), many studies present\nsystematic analysis on how well pre-trained LMs\ncan memorize knowledge in different domains,\nsuch as temporal numbers (Lin et al., 2020; Qin\net al., 2021), abductive inference (Bhagavatula\n248\nMoral Stories ETHIC: Deontology RealToxicityPrompts\nMLE DF DG S ENSEI MLE DF DG S ENSEI MLE DF DG S ENSEI\nAlignment Mean 4.77 5.22 4.81 5.25 4.57 4.85 4.73 4.91 5.23 5.25 5.45 5.61\np - .00* .07 .00* - .04* 0.06 .03* - .30 .03* .00*\nReadability Mean 5.64 5.52 5.31 5.42 5.33 5.27 5.19 5.25 4.96 4.88 4.93 4.90\np - .10 .05 .09 - .23 .10 .22 - .12 .18 .14\nOverall Mean 5.13 5.33 4.97 5.39 4.72 4.85 4.77 4.93 5.07 5.13 5.22 5.30\np - .02* .05 .00* - .09 .25 .03* - .10 .02* .00*\nTable 4: Human evaluation results on Alignment, Readability, and Overall quality of SENSEI and other baselines.\nDF: Data Filtering.

All these works focus more on on the\nso-called “descriptive knowledge” (Emelin et al.,\n2021), while recent work have started to pay spe-\ncial attention to whether LMs are well-encoded\nwith proper social values, which are typically ab-\nstract and sophisticated. For example, there are\nmany studies on bias in NLP, including gender\nbias (Wang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2017), race\nbias (Sheng et al., 2019a), sentiment bias (Sheng\net al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020), and etc. Everitt\net al. (2018) give a review of Artificial General In-\ntelligence (AGI) safety literature, discussing com-\nmon problems for designing safe AGI caring about\nshared human values.\nHuman Values Alignment of LMs. Aligning\nhuman and language model objectives is seen as es-\npecially important for “embodied” AI agents which\nlearn through active interaction with their environ-\nment (Tamkin et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021;\nEveritt et al., 2018). By continuously asking hu-\nman feedback during evaluation, Christiano et al.\n(2017) are able to train an RL agent that is aware\nof human preferences. Irving et al. (2018) attempt\nto address AI safety and ethics problems by us-\ning two RL agents to debate and have it judged\nby humans. Aiming to tackle larger scale align-\nment problems, researchers have tried to decom-\npose the problem into sub-problems (e.g., recur-\nsively summarizing chapters of a book to align\nwith human preference) (Wu et al., 2021), or de-\nploy a sequence of models while keeping humans\nin the loop (Leike et al., 2018). All these meth-\nods can be seen as online alignment methods, as\nthey require human periodic human involvement.\nSENSEI , instead, learns human values from offline\ndata, making it less costly and easier to deploy.\n6 Limitations\nSENSEI can be limited by the LM that it uses —\nfor instance, in few-shot learning scenarios, the to-\ntal length of in-context demonstrations + context is\nlimited by the max sequence length of the LM used.\nAdditionally, our work is focused on English, and\nSENSEI may require additional resources to accom-\nmodate the shared values in other languages and\ncultures. To handle cases where the context and\ngeneration are in different languages (e.g., machine\ntranslation to align with human values), SENSEI\nmay requires non-trivial modifications of its ar-\nchitecture. One could potentially extend SENSEI\nto these scenarios using multi-lingual sequence-\nto-sequence models such as multilingual-T5 (Xue\net al., 2021).\n7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we proposed SENSEI , a novel training\nframework aimed at aligning LM generation with\nhuman values. Given offline alignment datasets\nwith human demonstrations, SENSEI jointly learns\na reward distributor (Critic) and a conditional gen-\nerator (Actor). Compared to several baselines,\nSENSEI shows superior performance on three hu-\nman value alignment datasets and additional bene-\nfits for transfer learning of unseen human values.\nFuture work could explore more fine-grained hu-\nman values and the value transfer ability ofSENSEI\non a larger scale. Another direction is to further\nstudy the integration of SENSEI with full-size foun-\ndation models, like GPT-3 (175B), or DeepMind’s\nGopher (Rae et al., 2021), to explore SENSEI ’s po-\ntential.\n249\nEthics Statement\nThe goal of SENSEI is to provide a general-purpose\nhuman values alignment framework for generative\nLMs. Still, the generation of SENSEI can be af-\nfected by certain biases from the LM it is based\non (Rae et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b), though\nthese biases may be partially mitigated by the align-\nment itself. Another major ethical consideration\nis that SENSEI can mimic undesirable attributes\nof the target alignment demonstrations that could\nbe non-contemporary and do not represent current\nnorms and practices (Liu et al., 2021d; Sheng et al.,\n2019b)—and SENSEI has no scheme to diagnose\nthese problems. Furthermore, our experiments and\nanalysis are done in English, and therefore we do\nnot claim that our findings will generalize across\nall languages and cultures, although our framework\nhas the potential to be extended to other languages\nthrough necessary modifications.\nReferences\nAmanda Askell, Yuntao Bai, Anna Chen, Dawn Drain,\nDeep Ganguli, Tom Henighan, Andy Jones, Nicholas\nJoseph, Ben Mann, Nova DasSarma, et al. 2021.
