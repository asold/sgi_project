  "abstract": "With the development of IoT, IoT devices have proliferated. With the increasing demands of network management and security evaluation, automatic identification of IoT devices becomes necessary. However, existing works require a lot of manual effort and face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose IoT-Portrait, an automatic IoT device identification framework based on a transformer network. IoT-Portrait automatically acquires information about IoT devices as labels and learns the traffic behavior characteristics of devices through a transformer neural network. Furthermore, for privacy protection and overhead reasons, it is not easy to save all past samples to retrain the classification model when new devices join the network. Therefore, we use a class incremental learning method to train the new model to preserve old classes’ features while learning new devices’ features. We implement a prototype of IoT-Portrait based on our lab environment and open-source database. Experimental results show that IoT-Portrait achieves a high identification rate of up to 99% and is well resistant to catastrophic forgetting with a negligible added cost both in memory and time. It indicates that IoT-Portrait can classify IoT devices effectively and continuously.",
