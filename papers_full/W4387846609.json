    "abstract": "The First Workshop on Personalized Generative AI1 aims to be a cornerstone event fostering innovation and collaboration in the dynamic field of personalized AI. Leveraging the potent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user experiences with tailored responses and recommendations, the workshop is designed to address a range of pressing challenges including knowledge gap bridging, hallucination mitigation, and efficiency optimization in handling extensive user profiles. As a nexus for academics and industry professionals, the event promises rich discussions on a plethora of topics such as the development and fine-tuning of foundational models, strategies for multi-modal personalization, and the imperative ethical and privacy considerations in LLM deployment. Through a curated series of keynote speeches, insightful panel discussions, and hands-on sessions, the workshop aspires to be a catalyst in the development of more precise, contextually relevant, and user-centric AI systems. It aims to foster a landscape where generative AI systems are not only responsive but also anticipatory of individual user needs, marking a significant stride in personalized experiences.",
