Following this approach of‘biological language modeling’, statistical\nn-gram analysis has been applied for comparative analysis of whole proteome sequences of 44 organisms. It has\nbeen shown that a few particular amino acid n-grams are found in abundance in one organism but occurring very\nrarely in other organisms, thereby serving as genome signatures. At that time proteomes of only 44 organisms\nwere available, thereby limiting the generalization of this hypothesis. Today nearly 1,000 genome sequences and\ncorresponding translated sequences are available, making it feasible to test the existence of biological language\nmodels over the evolutionary tree.\nResults: We studied whole proteome sequences of 970 microbial organisms using n-gram frequencies and cross-\nperplexity employing the Biological Language Modeling Toolkit and Patternix Revelio toolkit. Genus-specific\nsignatures were observed even in a simple unigram distribution. By taking statistical n-gram model of one\norganism as reference and computing cross-perplexity of all other microbial proteomes with it, cross-perplexity was\nfound to be predictive of branch distance of the phylogenetic tree. For example, a 4-gram model from proteome\nof Shigellae flexneri 2a, which belongs to theGammaproteobacteria class showed a self-perplexity of 15.34 while the\ncross-perplexity of other organisms was in the range of 15.59 to 29.5 and was proportional to their branching\ndistance in the evolutionary tree fromS. flexneri. The organisms of this genus, which happen to be pathotypes of\nE.coli, also have the closest perplexity values withE. coli.\nConclusion: Whole proteome sequences of microbial organisms have been shown to contain particular n-gram\nsequences in abundance in one organism but occurring very rarely in other organisms, thereby serving as\nproteome signatures. Further it has also been shown that perplexity, a statistical measure of similarity of n-gram\ncomposition, can be used to predict evolutionary distance within a genus in the phylogenetic tree.\nBackground\nMicrobes are the most diverse organisms on earth.\nGenomic and proteomic sequences of most major\nmicrobes are either already available or soon to be\nreleased; these sequences provide an almost overwhelm-\ning amount of information about the microbes and their\ngenetic makeup. The first bacterial genome sequence\nwas reported in 1995 [1] and now more than 1,000 gen-\nome and proteome sequences of microbes including\nplant, animal and human pathogens, are available\npublicly (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.\ncgi). With the rapidly increasing availability of whole\ngenome and proteome sequences of microbes, large\nscale computational recognition and comparison of pat-\nterns in biological sequences could be a first step\ntowards discovering and understanding the biology of\nmicrobes and their diversity. Understanding their diver-\nsity is important to make progress in the field of medi-\ncine, public health and agriculture [2], and possibly in\nexploring alternate energy sources [3]. Currently, the\nwidely accepted method for studying phylogeny (diver-\nsity) of microbes is based on a comparison of genes that\nencode a small subunit RNA (SSU rRNA) [4]. However,\n* Correspondence: madhavi+bmc@pitt.edu\nDepartment of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, 5150 Center\nAve, Suite 301, Pittsburgh, PA, 15232, USA\nOsmanbeyoglu and GanapathirajuBMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/12\n© 2011 Osmanbeyoglu and Ganapathiraju; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The use of the whole genome/\nproteome is considered to provide more robust informa-\ntion for grouping of organisms than the information\nprovided by selected gene sets [6]. However, comparison\nof whole genomes/proteomes may not be feasible for\nlarge sets of organisms using multiple sequence align-\nment (MSA) based methods as only a small portion of\ngenes is shared across all the organisms that are being\ncompared. Orthologous genes comparison (eg. as shown\nin [7]) which requires correct selection of orthologous\ngenes, protein sequence/structure domains comparison\n(eg. as shown in [8,9]) which requires the assignment of\nprotein domains at the seque nce/structure level, and\nwhole genome/proteome sequences (the pair-wise align-\nment eg. as shown in [10] or the alignment free eg. as\ns h o w ni n[ 1 1 ] )a r et h em a i napproaches for inferring\nwhole-genome-based phylogeny of microbial organisms.\nIn their previous work, Ganapathiraju et al. have sug-\ngested that genome or proteome sequences show char-\nacteristics typical of natural-language texts, and drawing\nupon this analogy of biology and language [12] algo-\nrithms originally developed for natural language proces-\nsing may be applied to study biological sequences: topic\ndetection algorithms to secondary or transmembrane\nstructure prediction, statistical n-grams for protein or\nproteome classification, etc.\nN-grams are sequences of‘n’ words in a running text.\nThe different n-grams that occur in a document and the\nfrequency of occurrence of each n-gram can be used to\ncharacterize the topic of the document or the author-\nstyle. N-gram frequencies or more sophisticated statisti-\ncal models of n-grams are widely used for text processing\napplications such as information retrieval [13], language\nidentification [14], automatic text categorization [15] and\nauthorship attribution [16]. In a biological context,\nn-grams can be sequences of amino acids or nucleotides.\nBy employing this analogy between natural language\ntexts and biological sequences, namely by applying‘biolo-\ngical language modeling’, whole proteome sequences of\nmicrobial organisms have also been shown to contain n-\ngram genome-signatures [17].\nFirst, Ganapathiraju, et al. [17] compared the n-gram\nfrequencies of 44 different organisms using the simple\nMarkovian uni-gram model (context independent amino\nacid model). For the proteins of Aeropyrum pernix ,\nwhen the training and the test set were from the same\norganism, a perplexity of 16.6 was observed, whereas\ndata from other organisms varied from 16.8 to 21.9.\nThis showed that the differences between the ‘sublan-\nguages ’ of the different organisms were automatically\ndetectable with even the simplest language model. They\nalso demonstrated that the modified Zipf-like analysis\ncould reveal specific differences in n-grams (proteome\nsignatures) in different organisms. In other words, speci-\nfic n-gram sequences were found in abundance in one\norganism but very rarely in other organisms, thereby\nserving as the proteome-signature of that organism.\nFurther, it has also been proposed that a statistical\nmodel of n-grams (more specifically perplexity )o fp r o -\nteome sequences varied from organism to organism. At\nthe time biological language modeling approach was\nproposed (2002), proteome sequences of only 44 organ-\nisms were available, thereby limiting the generalization\nof this hypothesis.\nN-gram based methods also have been successfully\napplied to biological domain. Karlin et al. introduced a\n“ genomic signature ” based on dinucletiode odds ratio\n(relative abundance) values which appeared to reflect\nthe species-specific properties of DNA modification,\nreplication and repair mechanism [18]. Campbell et al.\ncompared dinucleotide frequencies (genomic signatures)\nof prokaryote, plasmid, and mitochondrial DNA [19].\nThey showed that plasmids and their hosts have sub-\nstantially compatible nucleotide signatures. Mammalian\nmitochondrial genomes were very similar, and animal\nand fungal mitochondria were generally moderately\nsimilar, but they diverged significantly from plant and\nprotist mitochondria sets. Passel et al. studied genome-\nspecific relative frequencies of dinucleotides of 334\nprokaryotic genome sequences [20]. Intrageneric com-\nparisons showed that in general the genomic dissimilar-\nity scores were higher than in intraspecific comparisons.\nHowever, genera such as Bartonella spp., Bordetella\nspp., Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. had low average\nintrageneric genomic dissimilarity scores and they sug-\ngested that members of these genera might be consid-\nered the same species. On the other hand, they observed\nhigh genomic dissimilarity values for intraspecific ana-\nlyses for organisms such as Prochlorococcus marinus ,\nPseudomonas fluorescens, Buchnera aphidicolaand Rho-\ndopseudomonas palustris and they suggested that differ-\nent strains from the same species might actually\nrepresent different species. Recently, Pandit et al. identi-\nfied the distinctive genomic signature associated with\nthe DNA sequence organization in different HIV-1 sub-\ntypes [21].\nOne of the other earlier applications is protein classifi-\ncation based on n-gram frequencies [22]. Cheng et al.\nand Daeyaert et al. used n-gram composition of amino\nacid sequences for protein classification [23,24]. King et\nal. presented an n-gram-bas ed Bayesian classifier that\npredicts the localization of a protein sequence [25].\nRecently, Maetschke et al. developed an alignment-free\nand visual approach to analyze sequence relationship of\nproteins [26]. They used the number of shared n-grams\nOsmanbeyoglu and GanapathirajuBMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/12\nPage 2 of 12\nbetween sequences as a measure of sequence similarity\nand rearranging the resulting affinity matrix applying a\nspectral technique. They made use of heat maps of the\naffinity matrix to identify and visualize clusters of\nrelated sequences or outliers and n-gram-based dot\nplots and conservation profiles to allow detailed analysis\nof similarities among selected sequences.\nN-gram composition based approaches have also been\napplied to phylogenetic analysis. Stuart et al. used the\ns i n g u l a rv a l u ed e c o m p o s i t i o no fas p a r s e4 - g r a mf r e -\nquency matrix to represent the proteins of organisms\nuniquely and precisely as vectors in a high-dimensional\nspace [27]. Then, they used vectors of this kind to calcu-\nlate pair-wise distance values based on the angle\nbetween the vectors, and generated phylogenetic trees of\nmitochondrial genome based on the resulting distance\nvalues. Alternatively, Qi et al. developed a method to\nreconstruct phylogenetic tree based on n-gram frequen-\ncies from which random background is subtracted and\nneighbor joining method is applied [28]. Tomovic et al.\nalso developed classification and unsupervised hierarchi-\ncal clustering of genome based on n-gram profile simi-\nlarity measure [29].\nDiverse n-gram based methods for identification of\ncompositionally different regions have been devised. For\nexample, Mitic et al. reported genomic island determi-\nnation via binary classification of islands based on\nn-gram frequency distrib ution [30,31]. Rani et al.\ndemonstrated n-gram based promoter prediction where\nn-grams are used to determine a special bias towards\ncertain combinations of b ase pairs in the promoter\nsequences [32].\nIn language modelling, the most common metrics for\nassessing n-gram model composition is perplexity [33],\nwhich can be interpreted as the (geometric) average\nbranching factor of the language according to the\nmodel. Perplexity is a function of both the language as\nwell as that of the model. When considered a function\nof the model, it measures how good the model is (the\nbetter the model, the lower the perplexity). The higher\nthe perplexity, the more branches need to be considered\nstatistically. Perplexity h as been used to test perfor-\nmance of language models in a wide range of areas.\nSpeech recognition tasks [33,34], linguistic steganogra-\nphy detection [35], identification of news coverage [6]\nare some of the examples of the perplexity measure\nusage. In biological sequence modelling, Buehler et al.\n[36] used the perplexity metric as a measure of their\nsuccess in showing that the use of“ long distance” fea-\ntures can improve the maximum entropy based model\nof amino acids sequences.\nIn this study, we use Zipf-like analysis and the per-\nplexity measure to study the diversity among pro-\nteome sequences of microbial organisms as first\nproposed by Ganapathiraju et al. [17] to address the\nquestion of whether or not the sequences in proteins\nof different organisms are statistically similar or\nwhether organisms may be viewed to possess different\nlanguages. Today, with several ongoing genomics\nefforts, nearly 1,000 microbial genome sequences, and\ncorresponding translated sequences are available,\nmaking it feasible to test the existence of biological\nlanguage models over the evolutionary tree. Here, we\nextend the previous work [17] with 970 whole micro-\nbial proteome sequences and discuss how n-grams\ntruly reveal proteomic signatures and demonstrate\nhow the n-gram statistical language model could be\nindicative of evolutionary divergence at the genus\nlevel.\nMethods\nDataset\nOur dataset is comprised of all available translated chro-\nmosomal and plasmid amino acid sequences from\nwhole-genome sequences of 970 different microbial\norganisms downloaded from NCBI (January, 2010). The\nwhole microbial proteomes that belong to bacteria and\narchaea super kingdoms are 903 and 67, respectively.\nMore details on the distribution of microbial organisms\ninto classes are given in Figure 1.\nN-gram analysis\nN-grams are sequences ofn words. In a biological context,\nn-grams can be sequences ofn amino acids or nucleotides.\nFor instance, the sequence “ AAANTSDSQKE ” has two\ncount of the 2-gram AA, and one count each of the\nFigure 1 Dataset. The pie-chart represents distribution of microbial\norganisms in the dataset. For proteobacteria which is a very large\nphylum, the classes within this phylum are labelled. For all other\nphyla only the phylum name is shown.\nOsmanbeyoglu and GanapathirajuBMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/12\nPage 3 of 12\n2-grams AN, NT, TS, SD, DS, SQ, QK and KE. The formal\ndefinition of n-grams is given below:\nDefinition 1\nGiven a sequence ofN words S = s1s2...sN over the voca-\nbulary A, and n ap o s i t i v ei n t e g e r ,a nn - g r a mo ft h e\nsequence S is any subsequence si...si+n-1 of n consecutive\nwords [37]. There are N-n+1 such n-grams inS. For a\nvocabulary A with |A| distinct words, there are |A| n\npossible unique n-grams.\nZipf-like analysis\nZipf’s law is based on observations made by the linguist\nGeorge Kingsley Zipf and states that the most frequent\nword in any kind of text is expected to be twice as fre-\nquent as the second most frequent word, etc. In this\nstudy, we used a modified Zipf-like analysis as employed\nby Ganapathiraju et al. [17] to explore the differences\nbetween n-gram usage in different organisms. First,\namino acid n-grams of a given length are sorted in des-\ncending order by the frequency with which they occur\nin a reference organism of choice. In all the figures per-\ntaining to this type of analysis, the frequencies of the\nreference organism are shown in bold line. For com-\nparative analysis, the corresponding frequencies of these\nn-grams in all other organisms are shown in thin lines.\nFor microbes that are associated with animal hosts, the\nlines are shown in red and those that are associated\nwith plant hosts are shown in blue.\nPerplexity analysis\nIn text-processing, for a known corpus and its corre-\nsponding language model (for instance, a 4-gram\nmodel), how well the language model predicts a new\ntext composed of unseen sentences can be estimated\nby computing its perplexity [6]. The entropy of its\nwords ( H)d e t e r m i n e st h ep e r p l e x i t y(2\nH)o fat e x t .\nWe take the n-grams of the new text, and compute\nwhat the probability is of generating that n-gram with\nrespect to the n-gram distribution of the reference\ntext. The lower the perple xity, the better the unseen\ntext fits to the known corpus. When applied to amino\nacid sequences of whole proteome of organisms, it\ncan reveal how similar a new organism’ ss e q u e n c ei s\nto known organisms. This analysis can give us inside\ninto evolutionary relatedness of organisms. The for-\nmal definition of perplexity and related terms are\ngiven below:\nDefinition 2\nLet p(x) be the probability mass function of a random\nvariable X, over a discrete symbol (or alphabet) X: p(X) =\nP(X = x), xÎ X\nThe entropy is the average uncertainty of a single ran-\ndom variable [38]:\nEp EX px px\nxX\n() ( ) () l o g ()==\n∈\n∑ 2 (1)\nDefinition 3\nThe cross-entropy between a random variable X with\ntrue probability distributio n p(x) and probability mass\nfunction q (normally a model of p) is given by [38]:\nEXq px qx\nx\n(, ) ( ) l o g ( )= ∑ 2 (2)\nDefinition 4\nIn terms of n-gram analysis, perplexity is a measure of\nthe average branching factor and can be used to mea-\nsure how well an n-gram predicts the next juncture type\nin the test set. IfN is the order of the n-gram andQ is\nthe number of junctures in the test set, the perplexityB\ncan be calculated from the entropyE by [38]:\nB E= 2 (3)\nwhere\nE Q px qj j j i\ni\nii N=−\n=\n−− +∑\n1\n2\n1\n11( ) log ( | ,..., ) (4)\nWith respect to n-grams, perplexity is given for pre-\nvious n-1 letters in a sequence denoting how many dif-\nferent letters can occur in the n th position on an\naverage. For example, given any two letters in the\nsequence AACCTAACCTAACCTAA CCTAACC..., the\nthird letter can be only one out of 4 possibilities. In\nother words, perplexity is only 1 in guessing the 3\nrd let-\nter given two previous letters in the sequence (as\nopposed to being 4 for a random sequence of\nnucleotides).\nIn this study, perplexity is defined by frequencies of\nn-grams and n-1 grams computed as follows:\nFor each n-gram denoted as n-gram\nj, its count in both\ntraining and test set data are found and denoted as\nC\ntrain-nj and Ctest-nj, respectively.\nT h ec o u n t so ft h e( n - 1 )g r a mf o rn - g r a mj (i.e the\nsequence of the first n-1 characters in n-gramj)a r ea l s o\nfound and denoted as Ctrain-(n-1)j and Ctest-(n-1)j.\nThen the entropy of the test sequence is computed as\nE N C C\nCtest nj\nj\ntrain nj\ntrain n j\n=− −\n=\n−\n−−\n∑\n1\n2\n1 1\nlog ( )\n()\n(5)\nOsmanbeyoglu and GanapathirajuBMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/12\nPage 4 of 12\nwhere j represents the jth n-gram and N is the count\nof all the n-grams in the sequence.\nPerplexity is computed as2E.\nMultinomial Logistic Regression\nMultinomial logistic regression (MLR) is used for multi-\nclass classification where the dependent variable is poly-\ntomous and independent variables (predictors) are\nnumerical or categorical. The model is generalization of\nlogistic regression where the binary dependent variable\nis interpreted as occurre nce or non-occurrence of a\ncharacteristic. It is expressed in the form\nlog Pr\nPr1 0\n1−\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟ =+\n=\n∑bb x i\ni\nn\ni (6)\nwhere is the intercept and the bi’sd e n o t et h e\nunknown logistic regression coefficients ofxi parameters\n(ngram occurences) while Pr denotes the probability\nthat the characteristic will occur. The quantity on the\nleft side of the equation is called alogit. The model can\nbe generalized in the case where the dependent variables\nhave more than two categories. For possible q cate-\ngories, q-1 logits are needed to be modelled as\nlog Pr( )\nPr( ) ,()category\ncategory bb x jj\nq\nj\ni\nj\ni\nk\ni\n⎛\n⎝\n⎜⎜\n⎞\n⎠\n⎟⎟ =+ =\n=\n∑0\n1\n1,,..., q − 1 (7)\nAs seen from the above equation, one of the cate-\ngories is used as reference (baseline category). After esti-\nmating the coefficients of the model by maximum\nlikelihood model, the probabilities of each one of the\ncategories can be calculated. The final prediction is the\ncategory with highest probability [39].\nSuites of tools\nBiological Language Modeling Toolkit (BLMT) [40] and\nPatternix Revelio (under review) are two suites of tools\nfor proteome and genome sequence processing, devel-\noped by Ganapathiraju and others. The suites contain\ntools for computing n-gram frequencies and perplexity,\nand are designed to use data preprocessing in suffix\narrays for efficient comparisons of large scale sequences.\nAll of the computations presented here have been car-\nried out with these two suites of tools.\nResults and Discussion\nUnigram signatures of whole proteomes\nWe performed the modified Zipf-like analysis to investi-\ngate word-usage in whole proteomes of all the 970\nmicrobial organisms in our dataset. In Figure 2, the fre-\nquencies of the unigrams of Brucella suis 1330 are\nshown in bold magenta. The x-axis shows the unigrams\n(amino acids) in descending order of their frequency in\nB. suis 1330. Frequencies of corresponding unigrams in\nother plant pathogens are shown in thin blue lines and\nthose in animal pathogens are shown in thin red lines.\nThe rank of a specific unigram refers to its position\nwhen listed in descending order of frequency. For B.\nSuis 1330 s h o w ni nF i g u r e2 ,a m i n oa c i dA has rank 1,\nL h a sr a n k2a n dC has rank 20. It can be seen from\nthis figure that the ranks of corresponding unigrams are\ndifferent in other organisms, but rare-unigrams in one\norganism are rare overall in all organisms.\nWe explored whether this type of analysis would\nenable classification and groupings of organisms based\non similarities in unigram counts and whether unigram\npreferences are conserved across different species of a\ngiven genus. In Figure 3, the unigram distribution is\nshown separately for six differentgenera (Brucella, Bur-\nkholderia , Bacillus , Xanthomonas, Pseudonomas ,a n d\nE. coli). To allow comparison across the six plots shown\nin the figure, the ordering of unigrams along the x-axis\nis kept consistent and it is that of their rank inB. suis\n1330. Supplementary material Additional File 1 shows a\nlist of species in each genus. Within a specific genus\n(i.e., within each subplot) the species show a similar uni-\ngram distribution, thereby suggesting that the unigram\ndistribution serves as agenus signature.W h e nw ec o m -\npare unigram distributions of different genera within the\nsame class (a class is composed of several genera), we\nfind that unigram signatures are similar but not identical\nFigure 2 Comparative Zipf-like analysis for unigrams .\nDistribution of amino acid n-grams with n = 1 inBrucella suis 1330\nin comparison with the distribution of the corresponding amino\nacids in other organisms is shown. The unigrams on the x-axis are\narranged according to their rank inB. Suis 1330. Percentage count\nof n-grams ofBrucella suis 1330are plotted in bold magenta line.\nCorresponding frequencies of unigrams in the other animal\npathogens are shown in thin red and plant pathogen in thin blue\nlines.\nOsmanbeyoglu and GanapathirajuBMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/12\nPage 5 of 12\nfor different genera within the same class. The signa-\ntures are different when genera are of different classes.\nFor example, in Figure 3, E. coli, Xanthromonas and\nPseudonomas belong to theGammaproteobacteria class\nand show more similar unigram distribution pattern\ncompared to other genera which belong to different\nclasses such as Brucella (belongs to Alphaproteobac-\nteria), Burkholderia (belongs to Betaproteobacteria), and\nBacillus (belongs to Bacilli). More examples can be seen\nin supplementary material Additional File 2.\nWe also carried out multinomial logistic regression analy-\nsis to see whether the whole proteome unigram occur-\nrences can be used to predict genus, class and phylum\ncategories of microbial organisms. A subset of the dataset\nconsisting of genera which have at least 9 species each are\nused to build the multinomial logistic regression model.\nEach model is built on the occurrence a single unigram.\nA 10-fold cross-validation has been carried out for predic-\ntion of genus, class and phylum levels. The performance\nof the model was evaluated by averaging the accuracies\nover 10 sets. Additionally, dimensionality reduction has\nbeen carried out on the on the dataset to explore the pre-\ndiction power principle components. Figure 4 shows the\nprediction results of the models built with a single variable\n(one of the unigram frequencies, or the first principle\ncomponent). It is seen that the model distinguishes species\nat class and phylum levels with more than 70% accuracy\nRare n-grams\nWhile there is a striking variation in rank of certain\nn-grams in different organisms, n-grams in one organ-\nism are usually rare in all organisms. This was observed\nby [17] and explained by Poddar et al.’s [41] analysis of\nunigram distributions of various proteomes that the\namino acids which are coded by multiple codons occur\nmore frequently than those coded by fewer codons. In\nthe standard genetic code, even among those amino\nacids that are coded by only one codon, the occurrence\nFigure 3 Unigram distribution in the proteomes of different genera . Unigram distribution of species from the genera (A) Brucella ,\n(B) Burkholderia, (C) Bacillus, (D) Xanthomonas, (E) Pseudonomas and (F) Escherichia are shown. Within a specific genus, and to some extent\nwithin the same class, most species show a similar unigram distribution.\nFigure 4 Accuracy of multinomial logistic regression model\nbuilt with unigram (amino acid) frequencies and first principle\ncomponent of all unigrams.\nOsmanbeyoglu and GanapathirajuBMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/12\nPage 6 of 12\nof tryptophan (W) was less frequent than the occurrence\nof methionine (M). This could be linked to the fact that\nits codon (TGG), when changed the third position\nbecomes a stop codon (TGA), and this would be detri-\nmental to the protein and therefore is usually not cho-\nsen by organisms during evolution. Similarly, among\nt h o s ea m i n oa c i d st h a ta r ec o d e db yo n l yt w oc o d o n s ,\nthe occurrence of cysteine (C) was fewer. The change in\nthe third position of C also leads to a stop codon. Tryp-\ntophan and cysteine are the least frequently occurring\namino acids of all the proteomes of micro organisms\nimplies that they are not incorporated in proteins unless\nthey play a specific role. Our findings with a larger data-\nset further support Poddar et al.’s arguments described\nabove.\nHigher order n-gram analysis\nAs we move to the larger n-grams for Zipf-like analysis,\norganisms show much more marked differences with\nsome peculiar outliers. Strikingly, we found n-grams\nthat are very frequent in some organisms, yet rare (or\ncompletely absent) in others. Examples are shown in\nFigure 5 for n = 4 inBartonella tribocorum CIP 105476\n(Figure 5A), Alibrio salmonicida LFI1238 (Figure 5B),\nMycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra(Figure 4C), Borrelia\nduttoni Ly (Figure 5D). For example, Figure 5A shows\nthe 4-gram frequencies withBartonella tribocorum CIP\n105476 as reference organism. The 4-grams YGNA,\nYDNA, NAHV, NARV, NLSH, ARVY and GNPL are\nt h et o pf o r t ym o s tf r e q u e n t4 - g r a m si nB. tribocorum ,\nbut are very rare in other organisms. Similarly, excep-\ntionally frequent 4-grams are also found in other organ-\nisms (see Figure 5). More examples are shown in\nAdditional File 3.\nN-gram proteome composition might also lay a foun-\ndation to explore the biological significance of differ-\nences in individual organisms. The species in the\nBartonella genus are facultative intracellular pathogens\ninfecting humans and other animals. The top forty most\nfrequently used 4-grams in Bartonella tribocorum ,a r e\nused very rarely in other organisms (Figure 5A). These\n4-grams are rare even among other members of the\nsame genus (Figure 6). The other organisms shown in\nFigure 5 are: human-specific pathogen B. baciliformis\nand B. quintana, feline-specific B. henselae,m o u s e ,v o l e\n(human)-specific B. grahamii , and the rat-specific\nB. tribocorum , all of which belong to the same genus.\nW h e nt h et o pf o r t y4 - g r a m so fB. tribocorum are com-\npared to the top forty 4-grams of other members of the\nBartonella genus, B. grahamii shows most similar pat-\ntern for those peculiar 4-grams. The phylogenic tree\nanalysis of Bartonella shows B. tribocorum and B. graha-\nmii a r ec l o s e rt oe a c ho t h e rt h a nB. quintana, B. hense-\nlae,a n dB. baciliformis.M o r e o v e r ,B. tribocorumand\nB. grahamii have three of the important genomic islands\nvbh, virB and trw compared toB. quintana and B.hense-\nlae which have just two virB and trw [42]. Moreover,\nB. bacilliformas has none of those islands and has flagel-\nlum which makes it different from the other members of\nBartonella. Even a simple Zipf-like analysis of the top 4-\ngram distributions of the whole proteome of B. tribo-\ncorum (Figure 6) can reveal differences among species\nin a given genus. Using this method can thus reveal pro-\nteomic signatures.\nWe also explored whether higher order n-gram distri-\nbutions show comparable trend as unigrams, displaying\ngenus specific signatures. Figure 7 shows frequency of\n4-grams for six differentgenera (Brucella, Burkholderia,\nBacillus , Xanthomonas, Pseudonomas, E. coli ). The\nx-axis shows top 40 4-grams of B. suis 1330 in all the\n6 subplots in Figure 7, to enable cross comparison. The\nlist of species in each genus is given in Additional File\n1. Within a specific genus, most species show a similar\n4-gram distribution for these particular n-grams, thereby\nsuggesting that the specific 4-gram distribution is con-\ns e r v e dw i t h i nt h eg e n u s .W h e nw em o v e dt h ea n a l y s i s\nto class-level, we observed variation for 4-gram distribu-\ntio\nn from one genera to the other. Table 1 shows corre-\nlation of top forty 4-gram frequencies betweenBrucella\nsuis and corresponding frequencies of these 4-grams in\nother species, computed as an average over each genera.\nOnly genera with at least 9 species each are considered.\nThe genus to which Brucella suis belongs is shown in\nfirst row. It is seen that the correlation of 4-gram fre-\nquencies is very high at 0.99 for species of the same\ng e n e r ab u ti ti sl o w e rw i t hs p e c i e si no t h e rg e n e r a\nwhether within the same class or different class. 4-gram\nanalysis is able to reveal genus level signatures as in uni-\ngrams, but unlike in unigram analysis, the differences\nare more pronounced for different genera within the\nsame class. In previous analysis, Ganapathiraju et al.\nhave reported that the n-gram frequencies in human are\nvery different from those of bacterial and archaeal\norganisms, presumably due to their evolutionary dis-\ntance from unicellular organisms [17]. In the current\nanalysis over a larger dataset, we find that this is also\nthe case for some prokaryotes such asShigella dysentria\nas shown in Figure 8. None of the top forty 4-grams of\nS. dysentria are seen with that high frequency in other\norganisms in the dataset. More examples are shown in\nAdditional File 4.\nHost-specificity\nNext, we grouped the microbes by their pathogenecity\nas animal-infecting or plant-infecting, and compared\ntheir n-gram distributions. However, we did not observe\nsignificant difference between these two groups. In\nFigure 3, most of the pathogens infect animal but some\nOsmanbeyoglu and GanapathirajuBMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/12\nPage 7 of 12\nspecies of Burkholderia and Pseudomonas also infect\nplants. Plant pathogens that belong to these genera are\nshown in square markers. As seen in this figure, plant\nand animal pathogens do not show large difference in\nterms of their unigram distribution in a particular\ngenus. This might be due to the fact that microbes\nshare strategies for invading the host, whether plant or\nanimal [43]. Some examples of these strategies could be:\nutilizing the type III protein secretion machinery to\ninject effectors into cells, or having some effectors to\ntarget defensive signal transduction pathways in host\ncells, or having a common targeting domain in their\nsecreted proteins to enter host cells.\nPerplexity Analysis\nThe average perplexity of generating a sequence based\non the n-gram model of another sequence (cross-\nperplexity) will tell whether the two are similar to each\nother in terms of amino acid composition. The average\np e r p l e x i t yo fat e s ts e q u e n c ei sl a r g e ri ft h et e s t\nsequence is dissimilar to the reference sequence. In this\nstudy, we investigate whether whole proteome cross-\nperplexity values are comparable among the same group\nof microbes. Perplexity models have been computed for\nmany microbial proteomes and tested against all 970\nmicrobial proteomes. Below is one example.\nA 4-gram model from proteins ofShigella flexneri 2a\nstr. 301,w h i c hb e l o n g st ot h eGammaproteobacteria\nclass, was trained. For reference organism self-perplexity\n(i.e., when test sequence is same as the reference\nsequence) a perplexity of 15.34 is observed. For the\nother 969 organisms, the cross-perplexity ranged from\n15.59 to 29.5. Figure 9 shows the cross-perplexity values\nof only the organisms that belong to Shigellae and\nE. coli genera are shown with respect to their branching\ndistance from the reference organism. It may be\nFigure 5 Comparative Zipf-like analysis for 4-grams.

The species of E. coli also has very\nclose perplexity values with Shigellae , consistent with\nthe fact that the species ofShigellae are pathotypes of\nE. coli. Similar trend of cross-perplexity being propor-\ntional to branching distance is observed in the Barto-\nnella genus [42] (see Figure 10), suggesting that the\nn-gram statistical language model is indicative of evolu-\ntionary divergence within a genus.\nNext, we extended the comparison of cross-perplexity\nto test-organisms outside of the genus of the reference\norganism (see Figure 11). We find that the cross per-\nplexity of organisms within the same (or related genus\nsuch as E. coli) (red markers in Figure 11) is lower than\nthat for the other organisms. For all ‘other ’ genera\nwithin the same class (green markers) as well as for gen-\nera of other classes (blue makers), perplexity is higher\n(ranging from values 20 to 29 in Figure 11). The range\nof cross-perplexity is not different for genera of the\nsame class compared to genera of other classes although\nwithin the same genus as that of the reference organism\nthe cross-perplexity is indica tive of evoluationary dis-\nt a n c e( i . e . ,t h er a n g eo fb l u ea n dg r e e nm a r k e r si st h e\nsame in Figure 11), except for its own genus (red mar-\nkers). For example, Candidatus carsonella ruddii PV\nwhich belongs to the same classGammaproteobacteria\nhas the highest cross-perplexity 29.5. This microbe has\nlow G+C content whereas the reference organism has a\nhigh G+C content.\nConclusions\nThe ability to carry out large scale proteome analysis\nand cross-comparisons across proteomes leads to useful\ninsights in biology, most prominent of them being evo-\nlutionary relations. Our analysis illustrates that unigram\ndistribution of amino acids shows a fine resolution sig-\nnature at the genus level (genus signature). We also\nFigure 8 Usage of very distinct n-gram language models by some organisms.
