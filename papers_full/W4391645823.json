In other words, scheduling deﬁnes \nwhere and when production operations will be performed [ 1]. The production \nscheduling aims to optimize resource utilization, minimize the makespan, reduce \nglobal setup time, and satisfy customer demands [\n2]. According to Lawler et \nal. [ 3], in the majority of the time, scheduling falls under the category of non-\ndeterministically polynomial (NP) time problems. To address the complex nature of \nproduction scheduling problem, advanced techniques have been developed. Some \nof these techniques are the mathematical optimization models, heuristic algorithms, \nand machine learning (ML) approaches. Important inputs that the methods above \ntake into account is information as setup matrices, processing times, quantities \nto be produced, material availability, due dates, technical information, production \ncapabilities of the production lines that such a technique is modelled. Additionally, \nthe use of real-time data from the shop ﬂoor and the use of artiﬁcial intelligence \n(AI) techniques can improve adaptability in dynamic manufacturing environments. \nMoreover, using AI techniques in parallel with real-time data from the shop ﬂoor \narises new challenges, i.e., real-time decision-making. \nDigital twin (DT) is a technology that allows real-time monitoring and opti-\nmization of the physical environment, prosses, or assets [ 4]. DT is a technology \nthat enables the user to gain insights on the model’s accuracy [ 5].

DT have been used in many different domains, including \nhealthcare, urban planning and manufacturing [ 7]. In a variety of industries, the \ncombination of real-time data and the digital replica of the physical environment \npromotes the decision-making and allow the industries to continuously improve \ntheir performance [8, 9]. \nAsset Administration Shell (AAS) technology was introduced within the Ref-\nerence Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4. 0) [ 10] and has become a \nground-breaking idea in manufacturing of how assets are managed and used [ 11]. \nAAS are standardized models that allow industries to combine the physical assets \nwith their digital counterparts (i.e., machines, production systems, or tools), where \nAASs provide a framework to control and monitor the physical assets. AI scheduling \nagents have been used coupled with AAS concept in the literature [ 9, 12, 13]. \nAdditionally, AI scheduling agents are intelligent autonomous systems that take as \nan input production system information to plan resource allocation tasks [ 14]. The \nAI scheduling agents play an important role due to the fact that they can generate \na real-time efﬁcient schedule. Coupled with the AAS and DT technologies, AI \nscheduling agents can be used for the real-time decision-making or for predictions \n[14, 15]. \nMulti-agent system (MAS) are systems that are used to compose many \nautonomous agents, where these agents interact to each other [ 15]. MAS provides \ndecentralized and collaborative decision-making, where it allows the collaboration \nof different agents. Each agent in the MAS has some capabilities, decision-making \nabilities and takes decisions. MAS is used in order to solve complex problems where \none agent is impossible to solve. The idea of dived and conquer is used to divide \nthe problem into subproblems, where each agent solves a subproblem, and provides \nsolutions that are adaptable, robust, and able to handle real-time uncertainties. MAS \nis also combined with DT, AAS, and AI scheduling agents. In a further analysis, \nAASs can enable interaction between different agents, where the agents can be \nmodels as different assets. \nThe contributions of this work are the use of the DT in order to accurately \nsimulate and validate the AI agents that have been developed, as well as training \nsome of the agents. Moreover, the use of the AAS technology to exchange data \nbetween the DT and AI agents within the MAS and ﬁnally the developed AI \nscheduling agents that were developed and modeled based on the bicycle industry’s \nrequirements and challenges. \nThis chapter is organized in four sections, where the ﬁrst section introduces \nthe concepts of digital twins (DT), Asset Administration Shells (AAS), scheduling \nproblem, and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) applications. In second section are discussed \nrelated works. In the third section is explained the proposed MAS framework and \nexplain the optimization tools that have been developed. In the fourth section is \ndescribed the case study that the proposed framework is implemented. Finally, the \nlast section is the conclusion of this work, where some future works are discussed.\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 149\n2 Related Works \nThe manufacturing sector has experienced an evolution thanks to Artiﬁcial Intel-\nligence (AI). AI offers innovative methods for increasing productivity, quality, \nand efﬁciency [\n16]. Due to its capacity to handle complicated issues, evaluate big \namount of information, and make precise predictions, AI approaches have become \nutilized more and more in manufacturing. Numerous manufacturing processes, \nincluding quality assurance, preventative maintenance, supply chain management, \nand production scheduling, have beneﬁted from the application of AI approaches \n[\n17]. \nTwo of the most important tasks in the industrial sector are production planning \nand scheduling. For creating effective and efﬁcient production plan or schedule, a \nvariety of strategies, methods, and technologies have been developed and deployed. \nProduction planning comprises considering what to do and how to do something \nin advance. Scheduling, on the other hand, entails allocating resources or manu-\nfacturing facilities to handle work orders. Effective production scheduling lowers \nproduction costs, boosts productivity, and lastly improves customer satisfaction. \nDue to their capacity to handle complicated scheduling issues and offer precise \nsolutions, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems have been gaining prominence in \nproduction scheduling. Machine learning (ML) is one of the most frequently used AI \napproaches [\n5]. More effective production planning and scheduling algorithms have \nbeen created using genetic algorithms, artiﬁcial neural networks, and reinforcement \nlearning. \nHeuristics is one of the approaches to solve the dynamic ﬂexible job-shop \nscheduling problem [18]. Another popular technique, genetic algorithms, has been \nutilized in several research to improve production scheduling by describing the issue \nas a combinatorial optimization issue [19]. Nevertheless, the rise of Industry 4.0 has \nmade ML techniques an attractive alternative to address manufacturing difﬁculties, \ndue to the availability of data, powerful processing, and plenty of storage capacity. \nNeural networks and deep learning have gained more attention in recent years \n[20]. Additionally, reinforcement learning (RL), which uses experience to improve \nscheduling policies, has been proposed for production scheduling. The scheduling \npolicy is represented in RL as a function that connects the state of the system at \nthe moment with an action [21]. In conclusion, future research may concentrate on \ncombining several AI techniques to develop production scheduling algorithms that \nare more potent and effective. \nThe digital twin (DT) interest is growing from both an academic and an industry \nperspective. However, the deﬁnition of that concept in the scientiﬁc literature lacks \ndistinctiveness. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. \nThen, decisions and optimizations would be based on the same data, which is \nupdated in parallel with the physical system [\n22]. DT can be brieﬂy described \nas a framework or concept that combines the physical and real environment with \nthe digital and virtual one, with the use of novel interconnection methods and \ntechnological innovations [\n23]. This physical to virtual connection for addressing\n150 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nreal processes and assets to their digital representative ones can be characterized as \ntwinning. \nOne of the main technologies used, in order to realize most of DT implementation \napproaches, is simulation [ 24]. As already mentioned, the idea of DT is to build a \nvirtual version of a real system. This replica can be used to simulate and forecast \nhow the physical system will respond to certain situations. Thus, one of the best \nmethods to construct a virtual representation of the physical system seems to be \nsimulation, which enables engineers to test and improve the system before it is built, \nlowering costs and increasing efﬁciency. Digital twin and simulation technology \nare being used more and more frequently in sectors such as manufacturing and \naerospace, exhibiting their ability to completely change how complex systems are \ncreated and optimized [\n25]. \nFurthermore, digital twin implementation methods can support decision-making \nrelated to the scheduling task for a production system with potential uncertainties \n[\n26]. A crucial aspect for the development of a digital twin is the achievement of a \nhigh level of standardization and interoperability with systems outside the digital \nenvironment. The digital twin simulates some of the behaviors of the physical \nenvironment, and thus requires some kind of seamless information exchange with \nthe physical entities and the information they provide. OPC UA is a standard that \ncan provide standardization in the data exchange between the digital twin and \nproduction hardware, achieving real-time monitoring and control, interconnectivity, \nsecurity, access control, while also data modelling and semantics [\n27]. \nThe Asset Administration Shell (AAS) could be also used in order to standardize \nthe description and management of assets. The digital twin technology can exchange \ninformation with the asset via the establishment of a common information language \n[\n28]. In addition, the AAS and OPC UA are complementary standards that can be \nboth used to deﬁne the framework and protocol for that communication [ 29]; it \nis worth noticing that AAS is a collection of standards, namely IEC 62875, DIN \nSPEC 91345, IEC 62541 (OPC UA), and RAMI 4.0. In cases where the digital twin \ncomposes a higher level system such as a production line, a station, or a production \nsystem, it is usually composed of multiple assets and thus AAS models. From the \ndigital twin side, the AAS can be the middleware for exchanging information with \nthe assets or managing their behavior. It is important, however, to highlight that there \nis no standard way for describing an asset using the AAS; although the metamodel \nwill always be the same, there is a freedom to the different submodels and submodel \nelements that will be selected in order to describe any different asset. It is thus usual \nto exploit additional information modelling standards or framework to deﬁne the \nspeciﬁc components and information structures within the AAS metamodel – e.g., \nISA-88, ISO 22400, and ISA-95. \nDigital twin is not only about simulating the environment but also taking \ndecisions over the next actions, which can then be used on the physical environment. \nSimulation on its own cannot address this issue, and AI agents is a way that this \nchallenge can be solved. Multi-agent systems are preferred over centralized software \ncomponents in cases where the problem is hard enough to be solved from a mono-\nlithic software component. It is a decentralized approach that breaks the problem\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 151\ninto subproblems and each agent has access only to the subproblems compatible \nwith its skills. In the case of production scheduling, this is a useful approach as it \nenables different types of scheduling problems being solved by different AI methods \nbased on which method best satisﬁes the requirements. AI is a broad term and in \nscheduling in particular the most common methods are heuristic, metaheuristic, \nmathematical optimization, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and policy-\nmaking. \nMathematical optimization, also referred as mathematical programming, is an \noptimization model consisted of input sets and parameters, decision variables, \nconstraints/expressions, and the objective function. Based on the constraints and \nthe objectives, the model may be classiﬁed as linear, nonlinear, convex, integer, and \nmixed-integer problem, with different type of algorithms to optimize the objectives. \nAs such, as important as the model, the algorithm that is used in order to ﬁnd a \nboth feasible and accurate solution is also crucial for the quality of the solution. The \nalgorithms may be exact or heuristic-based, while metaheuristic methods are also \npopular for various optimization problems. \nHeuristics have been deployed to solve various production scheduling opti-\nmization problems. A combination of constructive heuristics and iterated greedy \nalgorithm was used to solve the distributed blocking ﬂowshop scheduling problem \n(DBFSP) and lead to makespan minimization [\n30]. Montiel et al. (2017) proposed \nan approach for the stochastic optimization of mine production schedules with the \nuse of heuristics, implementing iterative improvement by swapping periods and \ndestinations of the mining blocks to create the ﬁnal solution [\n31]. Heuristics can also \nbe successfully deployed to optimize the scheduling task, aiming at reducing total \nenergy consumption [\n32]. Jélvez et al. (2020) worked for a new hybrid heuristic \nalgorithm to solve the Precedence Constrained Production Scheduling Problem \n(PCPSP) for an open-pit mining industry [\n33]. \nHeuristic and metaheuristic algorithms focus on an intelligent search along the \nsolution space, which does not ensure the quality of the solution, and in complex \noptimization problems require ﬂexible time delays. Deep learning methods, on the \nother hand, do not depend on searching the solution space, but rather predicting \nthe solution based on patterns from historical information. Although in most cases \nthe results are guaranteed to be fast, it is not necessarily of high quality. In \nreality it depends on the deep learning model that was used, the dataset quality \nand quantity. In some cases, there is also a dataset shortage which makes the \nproblem even more difﬁcult to solve. In practice, researchers may address this \nproblem via the utilization of a system digital replica which is able to simulate \nthe behaviors of the actual system in a realistic manner. This can support the \ndevelopment of either reinforcement learning methods that use the simulation as \na reward retrieval plugin or for extracting artiﬁcial dataset that can then be used in \nsupervised learning models to learn and adapt to the actual system implementation. \nEspecially, deep reinforcement learning has showed great potential in recent years in \ndealing with complex scheduling optimization problems. Researchers have focused \non the implementation of deep reinforcement learning techniques for production \nscheduling-related problems where there is lack of data, and the problem appears\n152 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nhigh complexity. The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is one of the most \ncommon optimization problems related to production scheduling that the scientiﬁc \ncommunity has tried to solve with the application of deep reinforcement learning. \nZhang et al. (2020) developed a deep reinforcement learning agent, able to select \npriority dispatch rules to solve the JSSP [\n19]. Liu et al. (2020) followed a similar \ndeep reinforcement learning approach to solve both the static and dynamic JSSP \n[\n34]. Rather than only solving the JSSP, there have been also solutions for the \noptimization of the whole production system with the use of deep Q-learning, a \nvery popular deep reinforcement learning technique in the last decade [\n35]. \nWhile all the technologically innovative techniques have helped to develop \nsmarter and more efﬁcient systems and tools, these solutions could also be integrated \nin an efﬁcient way in the actual production system through a digital twins (DT) \nand can help in integrating such solution to increase productivity. Villalonga et al. \n(2021) proposed a framework for dynamic scheduling with the use of digital twins to \nrepresent actual production assets in order to enhance decision-making [\n36]. Zhang \net al. (2021) use the digital twin concept to gather real-time data from the shop \nﬂoor and realize an effective dynamic production scheduling [ 37]. To achieve real-\ntime decision-making, the implementation of a digital twin appears a great potential, \nsince uncertain and dynamic events are addressed effectively. Dynamic interactive \nscheduling method can be enhanced and strengthened by the use of DT [ 26, 38]. \nHowever, digital twin concept can also be implemented to support production \nscheduling in an ofﬂine mode, such as the ofﬂine simulation of a production system. \nThis gives the ability to train scheduling agents in more dynamic environments and \nrespond to uncertainties even when they have not yet been identiﬁed. Nevertheless, \na main challenge in implementing production scheduling solutions and digital twins \nis the lack of a well-deﬁned data model. A solution to this issue can be offered by the \nAsset Administration Shell (AAS) concept. AAS is basically a method to represent \ndata in a deﬁned architecture [\n13, 39]. While in other problems there is some effort \nmade by the literature to implement AAS concept, in production scheduling it is not \nexplored. \nThe need to explore and address well-deﬁned standards for production opti-\nmization agents is clearly revealed when there is a need for cooperation between \ndifferent production agents, in order to formulate a multi-agent system. Researchers \nfrom a variety of ﬁelds have given multi-agent systems (MASs) a great deal of \nattention as a way to break down complicated problems into smaller jobs. Individual \ntasks are assigned to agents, which are autonomous entities. Using a variety but \nwell-deﬁned inputs, each agent chooses the most appropriate plan of action to \ncomplete the task [\n40]. Agents make decisions based on the information provided \nin the environment they are integrated and choose their actions proactively or \nreactively [\n41]. In manufacturing, multi-agent systems have gathered attention of \nmany researchers during recent years. MAS can limit the complexity of order \nscheduling in production systems through a cooperative multi-agent system for \nproduction control optimization [\n42]. A similar approach was followed for the \nimplementation decentralized scheduling algorithms in a test-bed environment [43]. \nA scheduling strategy to assist a manufacturing system experiencing learning and\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 153\nforgetting was supported by a multi-agent system to carry out the scheduling tasks in \nconventional production systems in close to real-time, and a simulation was utilized \nfor validation [44]. \nWhile the multi-agent systems implementation methods have been explored in \nrecent years, further investigation to address challenges is required. For example, \nthe use of standards in a scheduling multi-agent system is something crucial, in \norder to develop systems that could be easily transformed to a “plug & play” \napplication. In addition, agents that control or implement different applications \nand software should follow a hierarchical implementation to achieve better multi-\nagent system utilization and agents’ distribution. Lastly, if external applications are \ncontrolled through a multi-agent system functionality, Application Programming \nInterface (API) and standards are almost inevitable for the proper scheduling MAS \nintegration for the actual production system. The implementation of the scheduling \nmulti-agent system proposed in this work addresses the aforementioned issues and \ngives the opportunity for a more ﬂexible implementation of scheduling algorithms, \nwith different functionalities and heterogenous optimization techniques. \n3 Multi-Agent System Framework \n3.1 System Architecture \nThe architecture presented in Fig. 1 merges numerous Industry 4.0 technologies \nwithin a single framework with the goal of creating quality decision-making support \nfor the production manager in his/her daily tasks. Speciﬁcally, there is used a (1) \nuser interface for production manager interaction, (2) a multi-agent system for \ndecentralized production scheduling, (3) a production digital twin for performance \nvalidation, and (4) Asset Administration Shell concept for the description of \nproduction information and agents as assets within the I4.0 environment. \nThe ﬁrst aspect of the proposed framework is deﬁning the information exchange \nmechanisms and the corresponding information model to pass data over the different \ncomponents. This is one of the interoperability issues associated with enterprise \nsoftware as it is usual to utilize different information format and structures for \nthe same information context. In this architecture the AAS is used in order to \nrepresent production information, such as work orders, process plan, and production \nresources. However, AAS is a metamodel, and although it may specify some abstract \nmodelling objects and interaction mechanisms, it does not specify the detailed \nmodel to be used for the description of the asset. In other words, there could be more \nthan one AAS descriptions for the same asset, structuring differently the same asset \ncomponents and behaviors. To this end, there is a whole other topic of choosing the \n“right” information model for describing the production data so that it is achieved \nstandardization over the information exchange. However, this is not within the\n154 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nFig. 1 Framework Architecture of all modules and their interactions \nscope of this framework, and although the AAS is used for exchanging information \nbetween ERP software and the agents, the underlying model is not standardized. \nAs displayed in Fig. 1, information from the enterprise resource planning (ERP) \nare described within AASs for the corresponding work orders that the manager is \ncalled to satisfy within the following production period. This type of information is \nrestored from the user interface (UI), allowing the user (in this case the production \nmanager) review the workload of the upcoming days. The connection between the \nAAS and the ERP is performed via an ERP-to-AAS connector so that the proposed \nUI platform depends on the AAS model rather than the speciﬁc ERP information \nmodel structure. The UI rather than visualization of production information, it is \nalso an enabler for interaction of the user with the MAS as well as the production \ndigital twin. It is important to highlight that, unlike other systems, the integration of \ndecision-making results to the actual system is not a trivial task. In practice human \ninterferences is required to review and apply the production plan. \nThe exchange of information between the UI and the MAS is achieved via a \nMAS API, which is in practice a way of passing and receiving data regarding the \nproduction workload and status. The MAS is responsible for handling the data and \nprovide scheduling decisions for the user given the current production scenario. \nThere are multiple AI agents that were developed to address this problem each one \ngiving its own beneﬁts for the user. The reason for using more than one agent for a \nscheduling problem arises due to complexity of the problem, the user requirements, \nas well as the problem itself. Scheduling problems are widely diverse with respect to \nthe environment, constraints, objectives, and equivalently the optimization methods \nare usually compatible with a small portion of the overall set of scheduling \nproblems available. To this end, there cannot be a monolithic approach capable \nof addressing all production scheduling problems without lacking on satisfying the \nuser requirements. In order to address this issue, there was proposed the concept of a \nmeta-scheduling agent, which in practice was a compound of multiple AI scheduling \nagents each one providing different optimization attributes.\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 155\nFig. 2 MAS implementation based on the AAS description for the agent, showing interaction \nbetween agents and services/schedulers as well as the agent spawn procedure \nThe AAS was developed for the description of agent, which was retrieved by \nthe MAS framework in order to deploy the corresponding entities and bring the \nalgorithms to life. The AAS model for the meta-agent was consisted of a toolbox \nof optimization methods, with the description of connection dependencies as well \nas capabilities and skills provided by the speciﬁc method. During the initialization, \nthere were spawned individual entities within the MAS, each one carrying a speciﬁc \nset of skills (operations) corresponding to the AAS operations. It is important to \nhighlight though that the deployment of the agent within the MAS with the actual \nalgorithm runtime may differ. Speciﬁcally, the MAS is operating within a single \nframework, which is usually a local installation of all the partial components, and in \nthis case the deployment of the algorithms is better to be remote. Figure \n2 illustrates \nthis aspect for an example case of a scheduling agent. It can be displayed that a \nscheduling agent AAS may contain more than one scheduling methods, which are \nspawned as individual agents within the MAS framework. On top of that a meta-\nscheduling agent is spawned within this framework in order to support the scheduler \nselection and orchestration process within the MAS. The scheduling algorithms, \nhowever, may be deployed in different remote servers depending on the case. While \na scheduling operation is requested from one of the schedulers, the AAS interfaces \nsupport the communication between the agent installation and the actual algorithm. \nIn the previous architecture, it is important to clarify the need for the meta-\nagent as well as the requirement for generating multiple agent entities within \nthe MAS framework. In essence, the notion of an agent, as an independent\n156 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nentity, is useful when there is achieved some kind of communication within a \nnetwork of agents. This type of communication is achieved usually via a MAS \nframework implementation, which allows all the messages exchange and events to \nbe broadcasted between the inner entities seamlessly. As such, a MAS framework \nfacilitates the interaction between the agents; however, the implementation of the \nagent logic does not have to be within the same software component as the MAS. \nThis is because, usually the MAS is a unique software component with all of its \nagents and events operating within the same software container. It thus makes sense \nnot to include complex computational process (such as scheduling) within the same \nresources. \nTo this end, the actual optimization processes are kept aside from the agent \ninterfaces within the MAS. However, the reason that the scheduling agent AAS that \ncontains multiple scheduling methods is not spawned within the single agent in the \nMAS is dues to easier management of the different scheduling operations. Although \nthis is most of a design decision, it is easier to distribute a network of agents, each \none responsible for a speciﬁc scheduling method, because on the contrary side, all \nscheduling requests independent of method selection would ﬂow through the same \nagent, making it less efﬁcient to work with two different scheduling requests in \nparallel. The meta-agent is thus present to support the selection of the algorithm \nbased on the scheduling problem and allocate the optimization process to the \ndifferent agents. In practice, this speciﬁc agent is aware of the different scheduling \nmethods available within the system and is capable to analyze the request before \nselection. \nIn order to accurately assign the scheduling problems to the scheduling algo-\nrithms, there were used a problem classiﬁcation method based on three notations: \nenvironment, constraints, and objectives. This notation method is widely used in \nthe description of scheduling problems and has the ability to classify any type \nof problem. The environment expresses the production system equipment and \nprocess ﬂow, the constraints express the job-related characteristics or speciﬁc \nequipment/buffer requirements, while the objectives have to do with the criteria that \nthe scheduler need to optimize. The following are some examples for each case: \n• Environment: job shop, ﬂexible job shop, parallel machines, single machine, ﬂow \nshop, ﬂexible ﬂow shop, conveyor line, batch machine (e.g., oven), and so on. \n• Constraints: job release time, block (no buffer capacity before the machine), \ndeadline, sequence-dependent setup time, recirculation, stochastic processing \ntime, and so on. \n• Objectives: makespan, ﬂowtime, tardiness, energy consumption, and so on. \nIn order to classify the problem based on these notations in an automatic way, \nthe meta-agent was enriched with different rules (per characteristic per notation) in \norder to check whether the speciﬁc type of problem complies with these conditions. \nFor example, identifying a Job Shop schedule has to contain exactly one route per \nproduct and no alternatives. As a results, in cases that the agent was given with a \nschedule request that did not specify the type of scheduler to use, these rules were \napplied and the scheduler that complied with the rules was selected. In some cases,\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 157\nFig. 3 Simulation model of the wheels assembly department utilized as a digital twin to apply the \nschedule outcome from the MAS and observe performance \nmore than one scheduler would comply with the rules and more than one responses \nmay be produced. \nIt is also important to highlight that within a request there was used a speciﬁc \ninformation structure for providing the production data and similarly the scheduling \noutputs were contained within a speciﬁc scheduling response. The structure of the \ninformation may vary based on the implementation and thus it was not speciﬁed \nwithin this section. There are different alternative standards also to be used, while \nin some cases a speciﬁc ERP data model could be also utilized. In any case, this \nis another important aspect that is not speciﬁed within the chapter. However, the \nmethodology remains the same, with the exception that the problem classiﬁcation \nshould be applied to a different model. \nThe digital twin was the ﬁnal component of the architecture and ensured that \ninformation is validated in a close-to-reality scenario and the system performance \nis approved by the user. The production schedule was received by the MAS and \nthen sent (on-demand) to the digital twin in order to calculate its performance (see \nFigs. \n3 and 4). This step was executed before the schedule was displayed in detail \nto the user as there could be one of multiple competitive schedules available for a \nsingle case from different schedulers. The reason for using a digital representation \nof the production system was to give the ability to the user to evaluate the resulted \nschedule.\n158 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nFig. 4 Simulation model of the painting department utilized as a digital twin to apply the schedule \noutcome from the MAS and observe performance \n3.2 Paint Shop Scheduling Agents \n3.2.1 Mathematical Optimization \nThe paint shop scheduling agents were designed in order to be able to give \nsolution to the Paint Shop Scheduling Problem (PSSP) as it can be found in the \nliterature. This problem addresses the sequence of the items entering the painting \nline of the factory in order to optimize the performance indicators. This problem is \ndifferent from other scheduling problems as it usually encounters higher detail in the \ncombination of items and sorting before entering the line. The line itself is usually a \nmoving conveyor of carriers with some speciﬁc spatial constraints, setup delays due \nto color, and a constant speed. The objective is to ﬁnd the optimal combination of \nthe items within the “bill of material” of the products and sequence them in order to \ncomply with the desired performance. \nFigure 5 illustrates the PSSP in a simplistic way. As it can be seen the goal \nis to create a schedule – sequence and combination of items – for entering the \npainting line so as to create the maximum utilization of the line, which will reﬂect \nin reducing the makespan for the system. There are some requirements, however, \nthat the decision-making system needs to comply with in order to be in line with \nthe physical characteristics of the system. The following aspects were taken into \nconsideration: \n• The conveyor speed is constant and the carriers are equally spaced along the line. \nThis ensures that the input and output rate of the line is also constant.\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 159\nFig. 5 PSSP graphical representation \n• Each carrier has a unique capacity (100%) similar of all the carriers that cannot \nbe exceeded. \n• Items with different color cannot be placed within the same carrier. This is \nbecause in most cases the items are painting all together within the painting \ncabins. \n• In cases where two consecutive colors are placed within the line there should be \na setup delay, expressed in empty carriers so that the operators have the time to \nsetup the new color. \n• Each item type occupies a speciﬁc percentage of the carrier and can be mixed \nwith others as long as the max capacity is not violated. \n• In cases where an item cannot ﬁt into one container/carrier, then it will be used \nthe next consecutive carrier in order to hold the remaining capacity of the item. \nIt is made the exception, however, that no item needs more capacity than two \ncarriers. \nBased on the proposed conversions, the following mathematical formulation can \nbe created: \nSets: \nP Set of production orders that need to be painted \nI Set of different items (types) that need to be painted \nC Set of color codes \nParameters: \nqp, i Quantity of items i∈I included in production order p∈ P, q p, i ∈ Z≥0 \nci Capacity a carrier required in order to carry item i∈ I; c i ∈ R>0 \ndp, p’ Setup delay required between the items of two different production orders \n(p,p ’ )∈ P, d p, p’ ∈Z ≥0 \nAuxiliary variables: \nsi Deﬁnes whether item i∈ I has a size higher than one carrier, s i ∈{0, 1} \nac, t Deﬁnes whether this color c ∈ C has entered the line on time t ∈ Z ≥0, \nac, t ∈{0, 1} \nep, t Deﬁnes whether this item i∈ I has entered the line on time t∈ Z ≥0, ep, t ∈{0, 1} \nDecision variable:\n160 E.

This can be ensured by the following nonlinear \nexpression: \n. \nN∑\nt=0\n∑\n∀p∈P\n∑\n∀i∈I\nsi\n(\nxp,i,t •x p,i,t+1\n)\n≥1\n. Number of constrains:1\nIn order to transition to the linear version of the above expression, we start from \nthe logical expression: \n. \n(\nxp,i,t >0\n)\n∧\n(\nxp,i,t+1 >0\n)\n∨\n(\nxp,i,t−1 >0\n)\nThen, we deﬁne two auxiliary variables to carry the outputs of the above logical \nexpressions:\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 161\n. zp,i,t =\n(\nxp,i,t+1 >0\n)\n∨\n(\nxp,i,t−1 >0\n)\n. yp,i,t =\n(\nxp,i,t >0\n)\n∧z p,i,t\nThen, we use the linear expressions for ∧ and ∨ operators: \n. \nzp,i,t ≥x p,i,t+1\nzp,i,t ≥x p,i,t−1\nzp,i,t ≤x p,i,t+1 +x p,i,t−1\nyp,i,t ≤x p,i,t\nyp,i,t ≤z p,i,t\nyp,i,t ≥x p,i,t +z p,i,t −1\n⎫\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎬\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎭\n∀p∈P,∀i∈I,∀t∈Z\n≥0 |s i >0\n.

It is clear that in this \nexample, missing to produce the items at the average rates that are departed from \nthe buffer afterwards will cause an overﬂow, and in this case it is illustrated that the \ncircle needs to be at a much slower output rate than the cube item. \nThe ways that this can be applied are more than one, speciﬁcally the user may \nrequire this to be a constrain to the scheduler, by means that at no times this rate is \nexceeded, which can be applied by the next inequality, or via the objective function \ntrying to approach a speciﬁc value, yet this does not necessarily ensure that this \nvalue will not deviate in the ﬁnal results. \n. λi,k ≤λ desired\ni ,k=0,1,2, .., N,∀i∈I\n. min\n{ ∑\n∀i∈I\n∞∑\nk=0\n(\nλi,k −λ desired\ni\n) 2\n}\nThe above mathematical formulation is a very complex optimization problem to \nsolve for a real-scale production problem. As shown in the results section, real-scale \nindustrial problems may require scheduling up to 20,000 items from different orders, \ncolors, and types, making the problem extremely difﬁcult to solve in a considerably \nshort time frame. Thus, following the previous mathematical formulation, three \ndifferent versions were formed, each utilizing the expressions presented above \ndifferently. \n• The ﬁrst model is the nonlinear version (MINLP) of the problem, which applies \nthe nonlinear inequality constraints presented above. This allows lower number \nof constrains (thus lower memory utilization), but a very complex solution space \nthat most of the times requires more sophisticated optimization algorithms and \nmore demanding computational delay.\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 163\nFig. 6 Actual diagram from example case displaying the CPU delay differences of the modeling \napproaches as the number of orders increase \n• The linear version (MILP) was also considered where only the linear constrains \nare utilized, improving the computational demand but increasing the require-\nments for memory utilization in computational resources. \n• The last one was a simpler form of the linear version (two-stage MILP) in \nwhich constrain #4 is removed from the model, running the optimization only for \nmixing the items of order that acquire the same color. This allows a much faster \nresponse horizon, since there were no setup constrains to apply in the schedule. \nIn a second stage, once the allocation of items is achieved, the optimization \nprocess is repeated, but this time it schedules the sequence of colors as a function \nof minimizing the setup delay. In this way, the model manages to reduce the \nsolutions space and the constrains limitations. The problem with this model, \nhowever, is that it decreases the ﬂexibility of the solution as a trade-off for lower \nCPU time because it is not capable of providing good solutions for the production \nrate issue. \nIn Fig. 6, the implications of the different models on the CPU duration of the \ncomputational resources is clearly shown. The graphs are in a logarithmic scale in \nthe Y-axis and is clearly shown that both MILP and MINLP cannot outperform the \nsimpliﬁed-MILP, which can cover up to a very high number of items (100 orders \nare usually 18,000 items) in a relatively short period of time (20 min). \nIndices: \nDiscrete sets: np, ni, nc, nt \nDecision variables: np 2 + ni (np + 1) \nInput variables: np 2 + ni (np + 1)\n164 E.

First, a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) \nwas developed, which uses as an input information over the workload data (i.e., \norders, items, colors, and sizes), as well as produces the sequence of orders/items \nallocated into the painting line. The input layer to the model was based on the \nsame parameters that were used for the mathematical formulation of MIP models, \nresulting in the following encoded input vector (\n. x), while also the decision variable \nxp,i,t was described the output vector (. y) (Figs. 7 and 8):\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 165\n. x =\n[\n(( (q [p][ i] ∀i ∈ I),(f [p][ c] ∀c ∈ C)) ∀p ∈ P) ,c [i] ,d [c]\n[\nc']]\n. y = [x [∀p][ ∀i][ ∀t]]\n. Lx = pmaximax + pmaxcmax + imax + (cmax)2\n. Ly = imax tmax pmax\n. Lx and . Ly shown in the above equation represent the dimensions of the input and \noutput layers, respectively. In contrast to the model-based methodologies, neural \nnetworks are consisted of a static number of I/O parameters, which contradicts to \nthe arbitrary scale of the scheduling problems. In order to address this issue, the \nencoded input considers a preﬁxed maximum number of orders (pmax), items (imax), \ncolor codes (c max), and production duration ( tmax). For cases where less than this \nmaximum number is provided as an input, the encoder generates additional orders \nso as to fulﬁl the I/O layers of the neural network (NN) although sets the items \nquantity to zero, which will have no effect on the allocation process; for cases with \nmore than the maximum numbers, the model is unable to encode the input. The \nnumber of neurons per layer and the total number of trainable parameters for the \nwhole NN model are provided by the following formula: \n. neurons# = 2kLx\n. params# =\n∑\n∀k:layer\n[\n2kLx\n(\n2k−1Ly + 1\n)]\nAnother data-driven approach has been developed that treats the scheduling \noutput as a time series from which the next allocations can be predicted based on \nknown previous values of the sequence. As such, the whole production schedule can \nbe generated in a recursive manner, reducing the model’s prediction variables which \nimproves the accuracy as well as avoiding any limitations regarding the problem’s \nscalability. Similar to the above-mentioned approach, the ultimate objective is the \nprediction of x\np,i,t, for all the given orders, items, and timesteps; however, in this \nmodel a prediction is only applied for one timestep and is repeated for all the output \nsequence. The input features of the LSTM neural network consist of a dynamic and \na static part. The dynamic part as presented below are the features that change as \nmoving in the time axis. \nThe allocation of all items over a speciﬁc timestep (carrier) is given by the \nfollowing \nvector: \n.x [ti] = [x [∀p][ ∀i][ ti]] ,ti ∈ N\n166 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nFig. 9 Overview of LSTM RNN I/O layers design and how the speciﬁc input is derived as well as \nhow the output is represented \nThe following deﬁnes a variable that provides the number of remaining items of \nan order at that given timestep, given the sequence of previous allocation selections: \n. Q [p][ i][ ti] =q [p][ i] −\nti∑\nt=0\nx [p][ i][ t]\nGiven the above formula, the following vector is deﬁned: \n. Q [ti] = [Q[∀p][ ∀i][ ti]] ,ti ∈N\nMoreover, similar to the feed-forward NN model, some static information of the \nworkload revealing the colors, sizes, and setup delays must also be provided. The \nﬁnal conﬁguration of the input layer is shown in Fig. 9. \nFigure 9 presents the format of the I/O model, which is required for the LSTM \nmodel. Unlike MIP models, this method arises a problem in deﬁning the ﬁrst \nallocations (\n.x [0:L ]) as it requires historical information of a window (L), which \nare not deﬁned as the face a totally new schedule request. This problem is more \napparent in the training procedure as multiple scheduling results from different \nworkloads merged together into a single sequence to train the LSTM model. This \nissue was addressed by adding L number of timesteps in the beginning of each \nschedule, where L is the window of previous allocations that the model is using \nfor the prediction. These timesteps contained zero allocations of items and were \nresponsible only for fulﬁlling the input layer of the LSTM neural network model \n(Fig. \n10).\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 167\nFig. 10 Each graph (row) shows the total number of allocations from a product over time. Each \ngraph contains two lines for display purposes \n3.3 Deep Reinforcement Learning Scheduling Agent \nThe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent was selected to solve the dynamic \nscheduling problem (DSP). According to Chien and Lan [45], the DSP is susceptible \nto a number of uncertainties, including machine failures, the arrival of new, urgent \njobs, and changes to job due dates. In the literature there are several articles on \nthe DSP [\n46–49]. DRL agent is also combined with DNNs and deep Q-network to \napproximate of a state action value function [ 50, 51]. The proposed DRL agent is \ncombined with a discrete event simulator in order for training and testing the DRL \nmodel. In details, the DES that was used is the Witness Horizon from Lanner [\n52]. \nThe DRL and DES communicated via API, where the API is provided by Witness \nHorizon. In addition, except from API ﬁles, text ﬁles were used to exchange data \namong the DES and DRL (see Fig. \n11). The concept that was used for the DRL \nagent is to purpose task allocation to resources via the use of dispatch rules. In the \nliterature there are several research works that study the use of RL agent combined \nwith dispatch rules [\n53].\n168 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nFig. 11 DRL agent operation architecture \nThe Q-learning is an off-policy temporal difference algorithm and is based on \nthe idea of Q-function [54]. In the following equation, the Qπ(st,a t) is the expected \nreturn of the discounted sum of rewards at state st by taking action at: \n. Qπ (st,at) =max πE\n[\nrt+1 +γr t+2 +γ 2 rt+3 +...|s t =s,a t =a,π\n]\nThe main concept of the Q-learning is to use the Bellman equation as a value \niteration update. The agent in a decision point t in a state s t ∈S selects an action \nat ∈ A according to a policy π. Taking the action a t the agent gets to a state s t+1 \nwith transition probability p(s t+ 1 |st, a t) ∈ P(S × A → S) and reward r t ∈ R. \nAdditionally, γ is a discount factor at each timestep t.A l s o , a is a learning rate, \nwhere 0 < a ≤1. The objective for the agent is to ﬁnd the optimal policy π ∗ that \nmaximizes the expected sum of rewards. The Q-leaning has some limitations when \nthe environment is huge. For that reason, the deep Q-network (DQN) concept was \nused. Coupled RL with deep learning techniques Q-tables can be replaced with \nQ-function approximator with weights [\n55]. In order to solve the DSP problem, \ndue to the fact that the environment is huge, DRL DQN concept was used. Let \nus denote as Q(s,a; θ\ni) the approximate value using deep convolutional neural \nnetwork. Additionally, the ψ i are the weights at iteration i of the Q-network. The \nexperiences are denoted as e t = (st,a t,r t,s t+1 ) where each time t a r es t o r e dt oa \ndataset Dt ={e 1, ...,e t}. Chosen uniformly at random an instance from the pool of \nstored instances, a Q-learning update is applied of each experience (s,a,r,s\n'\n)~U(D). \n.

This chapter \ncontains the stats of the resources (down, busy, and available), the stats of the tasks \n(waiting, pending, on-going, and ﬁnished), and ﬁnally a list with the quantities or \nthe product orders. Moreover, an action describes the dispatch rule that is selected \nby the DRL agent to propose the task allocation over resources. \n3.4 Heuristic Optimization \nThe hierarchical scheduler is a decision-making module for extracting an efﬁcient \norder of required tasks [\n56]. The problem that the scheduler solves is the resource \nallocation problem [ 57], where the problem seeks to ﬁnd an optimal allocation \nof a discrete resource units to a set of tasks. The heuristic algorithm is based \non the scientiﬁc research of [\n58]. It is based on the depth of search concept, \nexcept the number of layers for which the search method looks ahead. The main \ncontrol parameters are the decision horizon (DH), the sampling rate (SR), and the \nmaximum number of alternatives (MNA). In each decision point, a decision tree \nis created based on the DH, SR, and MNA. Figure \n12 shows the nodes A1 ... . A N \nthat represents decision point where a task is assigned to an operator. The proper \nselection of MNA, DH, and SR allows the identiﬁcation of a good solution. For \nexample, it is proven in [\n59] that the probability of identifying an alternative of good \nquality (i.e., utility value within a rangeΔwith respect to the highest utility value) \nis increasing with the MNA andΔ. The pseudocode of the algorithm is deﬁned as \nfollows [\n60]: \nFig. 12 Search methodology example in tree-diagram showing the generation of different \nbranches and layers based on the MNA, DH, and SR\n170 E.

MNA and DH control the breadth and DH the depth of the \nsearch, \nrespectively. On the other hand, SR is used to direct the search toward \nalternatives that can provide better quality solutions. Thus, the quality of the solution \ndepends on the selection of the MNA, DH, and SR. \n4 Case Study \nThe proposed multi-agent scheduling framework was implemented, validated, and \nevaluated for a case study from the bicycle production industry. For this work \nand the deployment of AI scheduling agents in a production environment capable \nof producing optimized long- or short-term scheduling, two departments were \nchosen: painting and wheels assembly department. As already mentioned, there \nwere different types of scheduling agents. The purpose of using a multi-agent \nsystem for the deployment of various scheduling applications is twofold. The ﬁrst \nreason is that with the realization of a multi-agent system, one can use an integrated \nsolution without affecting the other entities of the production system. An algorithm \ncan be developed separately, as a stand-alone application in a multi-agent system. \nThe second reason is that with a multi-agent system, there is the possibility for \nautomated cooperation between different applications to coordinate multiple assets \nor functionalities. To combine both beneﬁts of a multi-agent system capable of \nsolving different scheduling problems and combine its assets to solve more than \none scheduling problems at one, the implementation method proposed in this work \nfollows the deployment of different scheduling algorithms integrated in a multi-\nagent system.\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 171\nThe multi-agent system for the scheduling agents was developed with the use of \nJANUS, an efﬁcient and ﬂexible agent-oriented programming framework that gives \nthe opportunity for easy and fast deployment of virtual assets. JANUS multi-agent \nsystem framework is compatible with the programming language SARL and also \nwith JA V A. In this multi-agent system, there are four main concepts that need to be \ndeﬁned before the deployment of any agent: agents, events, capacities, and skills. \nThe agent instance stands for all the operating sequences required for a speciﬁc \nbatch of functionalities and operations to happen when the agent needs to operate. \nAgents’ communication and behavior is controlled by events, which are predeﬁned \npatterns that allow all the agents in the framework to interact one with another. \nThe term capacity refers to an abstract description for an implementation in skills, \nwhich is used to deﬁne reusable capabilities of agent patterns without deﬁning \nimplementation details. Lastly, the concept of skills is a manner of implementing \na capability, which allows exchange and modiﬁcation of implementations based on \nown or adapted skills without modifying the agent’s behavior or the template agent’s \ncharacteristics. To address the scheduling multi-agent system using the JANUS \nframework, the scheduling agents are modeled as agents in the JANUS framework, \ncapable of spawning and operating under the control of a meta-agent, which is \nthe orchestrator agent inside the multi-agent system. The scheduling agents have \nspeciﬁc skills, related to the problem-solving algorithm and the meta-agent concept \nwas integrated, in order to realize an automated and distributed cooperation of the \ndifferent agents inside the multi-agent system, when there is a scheduling request. \nThe user is able to interact with the multi-agent system in the backend of a UI, \ndeveloped for the scheduling tasks visualization. \nIn practice, the meta-agent receives the scheduling request from the UI. This \nscheduling request is modeled in an AAS, as already described in previous sections, \nand the meta-agent is able to spawn the corresponding scheduling agent to solve a \nparticular scheduling problem. A scheduling agent is the parent “class” in JANUS \nthat implements events, skills, and methods, and can also consist of local variables. \nEach one of the scheduling agents accommodated three MAS events: \n• “Initialization,” where the scheduling agent has been spawned by the meta-agent \nduring the initialization of the framework and waits for a scheduling request \nnotiﬁcation from the meta-agent. During the initialization of the agent, speciﬁc \nscheduling agent parameters are deﬁned and initialized, able to serve a speciﬁc \nscheduling request type in the future. \n• “Scheduling request,” where the meta-agent is requested to notify the corre-\nsponding scheduling agent in order for the required scheduling computation to be \nperformed. After this event call, speciﬁc skills and operations are performed by a \nscheduling agent in order for the scheduling algorithm to calculate the schedule. \n• “Schedule response,” where the output of the scheduling task is emitted to all \nother agents of the multi-agent system. When the scheduling agent ﬁnishes its \noperation, the event notices every other agent in the framework that can listen to \nthis event.\n172 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nWhen a scheduling request reaches the multi-agent system, the meta-agent is \nresponsible for identifying the correct scheduler based on the request from AAS. \nThis AAS also contains information that, in addition to the scheduling task infor-\nmation, will indicate the required scheduling agent, which is capable of performing \nthe scheduling task based on some predeﬁned characteristics. After the scheduling \nrequest, the meta-agent performs simple ﬁltering in the provided information in the \nAAS to choose the corresponding scheduling agent. Each scheduling agent has its \nown input format. Since the JANUS meta-agent is responsible for the orchestration \nof the scheduling task, it will pass the information to the appropriate scheduling \nagent capable of performing the correct algorithm to compute the schedule. \nAs it was mentioned above, the reason for realizing a multi-agent system is \nthat a scheduler can be developed as a stand-alone application. Hence, to give \nthe ability to each scheduling agent to perform its scheduling skills without the \ndevelopment of the algorithmic part inside the multi-agent system framework, \ninterfaces were utilized to perform the scheduling algorithms through the scheduling \nagents’ skills. Moreover, a REST API was used for the agents to be able to reach \nout the scheduler’s endpoint and pass information to the algorithm. On the other \nhand, since there is not a certain point in time that the resulted response is expected, \nRabbitMQ message exchange channel was utilized for the scheduler’s responses. Of \ncourse, this is a design decision, and other protocols can be used to pass information \naround the different entities. \nIn the case study, three different scheduling agents were implemented in the \nmulti-agent system, each one with its own characteristics and functionalities. To \nvalidate the aforementioned multi-agent system implementation, the schedulers \ndeveloped and utilized were the following: (1) heuristic multi-objective scheduling \nframework, (2) mixed integer programming (MIP) model optimizer for production \nscheduling [\n65], and (3) a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler for dynamic \nproduction scheduling. The ﬁrst two agents were utilized to solve the scheduling \nproblem for the painting department of the bicycle industry, while the third one was \nutilized to solve the scheduling problem of the wheels assembly department. The \nﬁrst two agents were deployed with the goal of optimizing the scheduling sequence \nof a painting line. The DRL agent was deployed with the goal of solving the dynamic \nscheduling problem of a production system with uncertainties included. \nThe scheduling agents were deployed in the multi-agent system to support the \nscheduling task of the bicycle production system. Nevertheless, since the application \nshould be used by a production manager in an industrial environment, a UI was \nrequired. The UI was developed with the scope to showcase the scheduling task with \nall the mandatory assets in an efﬁcient and user-friendly manner. The UI consists of \nthe scheduling task formulation tab, where the production manager selects the orders \nthat need to be scheduled and chooses the corresponding scheduler. There is also a \nfeature where the user can run all the supported schedulers and compare the results \nbefore one actually can apply the schedule in the real production system. Results \nare shown in another tab, and this is a common table for the scheduled production \norders. In addition, there is the opportunity for the user to show some production\nDigital-Twin-Enabled Framework for Training and Deploying AI Agents for... 173\nFig. 13 UI multi-agent system tab \nKPIs through the digital twin tab where a DES run of the resulted scheduling is \nperformed. \nTo validate the whole framework performance, discrete event simulation (DES) \nwas utilized. Two DES models were developed, representing the production envi-\nronments of the two departments from a bicycle production system. These DES \nmodels were used to showcase the results of the scheduling request that the multi-\nagent framework handled, as well as for the actual operation of the agent for \nsolving the dynamic scheduling problem. The heuristic and the MIP schedulers were \ndeployed for the painting department whereas the DRL scheduler was deployed \nfor the wheels assembly department. JANUS multi-agent system spawned all three \nscheduling agents when the necessary information for accessing them is provided \nwithin the AAS deﬁnition after the scheduling request formulated in the UI. As \nsuch, the user could choose any of the scheduling agents and, using the toolbox \nof schedulers provided in the UI, address similar or different kinds of problems. \nThe user sent scheduling operations to the multi-agent system in an abstract manner \nwithout the need to specify the corresponding problem. After the scheduling request \narrival, the meta-agent was responsible to spawn the required scheduling agent. \nSeamless integration between the SARL software and the individual schedulers was \nachieved. \nThe resulted framework implementation showed great potential in achieving \nmulti-agent scheduling optimization. The UI (Figs. \n13 and 14) allows the user \nto evaluate the resulted scheduling through the use of DES. Production KPIs are \npresented and through the evaluation of the system performance on each occasion, \none can decide if the resulting schedule is efﬁcient. Manual tests were made \nin collaboration with the production manager, and the results were validated for \ntheir accuracy and precision. Hence, the proposed scheduling multi-agent system \nimplementation for the bicycle production industrial environment can effectively \nhandle the workload distribution among its different scheduling agents in order to \npropose the most appropriate production sequence. \nTable \n1 summarizes the agent results from testing the framework over some real-\nlife examples of the industrial use-case. The results do not directly translate on\n174 E. Bakopoulos et al.\nFig. 14 UI digital twin tab \nbusiness KPIs and are the log from the schedulers. This is why the digital twin \ncomponent is necessary to reﬂect how these solutions ﬁt into the overall production \nscenario and inspect the performance. \n5 Conclusion \nIn conclusion, the multi-agent system (MAS), digital twin (DT), Asset Administra-\ntion Shell (AAS) concept, and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technology are part of the \nIndustry 4.0, and more and more researchers and industrial experts aim to combine \nthese technologies. Digital manufacturing is an important step for industries and \nresearchers, where there are many gaps and challenges to overcome. Digitalization \nwill enable automation, increase efﬁciency, real-time decision-making, ﬂexibility, \nand adaptability in industries. This work proposes a MAS framework that was \ndeveloped for the bicycle industry using the concept of AAS, DT, and MAS for the \nproduction scheduling problem. A mathematical optimization, deep reinforcement \nlearning, heuristic algorithm, and deep learning algorithm have been developed \nto address the identiﬁed problems. The key contribution of this work is the \nuse of the DT to accurately simulate the production environment and increase \nthe efﬁciency of the developed AI agents. The AAS concept is also used to \nguarantee interoperable data transfer within MAS. Future research directions could \nbe considered the continuous exploitation of the DT and AI integrations. Moreover, \nthe AAS technology was used to fully parameterize the agents and the production \nenvironment on the simulator. \nAcknowledgments This work has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 \nresearch and innovation program under grant agreement No. 957204 MAS4AI.
