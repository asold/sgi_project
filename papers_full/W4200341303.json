Yee1* , Yanyu Wu1, Magdalena Harrington2,3 and Susan E. Waisbren4 \nAbstract \nBackground: Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) is a rare lysosomal storage disease characterized by cognitive \nimpairment in most patients. This post hoc analysis evaluated changes in cognitive function, adaptive behavior and \nfunctional outcomes in patients with neuronopathic MPS II over time. Fifty-five children with MPS II were enrolled \nin a 24-month observational study (NCT01822184). The Differential Ability Scales, second edition (DAS-II; early years \nbattery for ages 2 years 6 months to 6 years 11 months, school age battery for ages 7 years to 17 years 11 months), \nVineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-II) and the Hunter Syndrome-Functional Outcomes for Clini-\ncal Understanding Scale (HS-FOCUS) were performed at baseline and 3-month intervals over 2 years. A subgroup of \n38 children with a DAS-II General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score of 55–85 (below average–very low abilities) at any \ntime during the study were included in this analysis.\nResults: Mean (standard deviation [SD]) early years DAS-II GCA score decreased from 73.4 (15.7, n = 22) at baseline \nto 62.7 (34.9, n = 6) at month 24. For the six patients with early years GCA assessments at baseline and month 24, \nmean (SD) GCA scores decreased from 72.3 (21.3) at baseline to 62.7 (34.9) at month 24. School age GCA scores were \nstable over 2 years: mean (SD) 72.4 (11.8, n = 10) at baseline; 74.3 (12.3, n = 8) at month 24. Mean (SD) VABS-II Adap-\ntive Behavior Composite (ABC) scores were stable throughout the study (baseline, 81.8 [11.8, n = 36]; month 24, 81.0 \n[10.2, n = 13]). Some associations between items and domains of HS-FOCUS (p < 0.05) and DAS-II GCA and VABS-II ABC \nscores were shown, but there was no clear pattern of changes in HS-FOCUS over 2 years.\nConclusions: The DAS-II measured changes in cognitive function over 2 years in younger patients with MPS II, \nwhereas cognitive function in older patients remained stable. Further research is required to confirm the content \nvalidity of the DAS-II in different patient populations with MPS II. The VABS-II and HS-FOCUS were not sensitive tools \nfor measuring behavioral and functional changes over 2 years. These findings may inform selection of appropriate \ncognitive and behavioral assessment tools for future studies.\nKeywords: Adaptive behavior, Cognitive ability, DAS-II, HS-FOCUS, Mucopolysaccharidosis II, VABS-II\n© The Author(s) 2021.

In \naffected patients, pathogenic variants in the IDS gene \nresult in deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme \nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  karen.yee@takeda.com\n1 Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 12Yee et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:501 \niduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) [1]. This leads to accumu -\nlation of glycosaminoglycans in tissues and organs \nthroughout the body, causing multiorgan dysfunction \n[1–3]. The presentation of MPS II and disease progres -\nsion vary widely between patients [1–3]. Somatic clinical \nmanifestations of MPS II include coarse facial features, \nhearing loss, severe airway obstruction, skeletal deformi -\nties, joint stiffness and cardiovascular disease [1–3]. The \nsomatic burden of disease can be substantial and may \nseverely impact patients’ physical functioning and their \nability to perform day-to-day activities [4].\nApproximately two-thirds of patients with MPS II have \nneuronopathic disease, in which they present with central \nnervous system involvement and cognitive impairment, \nin addition to somatic symptoms [1, 5, 6]. These patients \ntypically experience a developmental plateau between the \nages of 2 and 4  years, followed by deterioration of cog -\nnitive and adaptive behavior, decline in physical func -\ntioning and premature death, usually during the second \ndecade of life [6, 7]. Patients with non-neuronopathic dis-\nease do not have central nervous system involvement, but \nmay still have learning difficulties and behavioral prob -\nlems as a result of somatic manifestations of the condi -\ntion, such as hearing loss, impaired motor skills or brain \nabnormalities [8, 9].\nThe current standard of care for patients with MPS \nII is intravenous enzyme replacement therapy with \nrecombinant I2S (idursulfase [Elaprase ®]; Takeda Phar -\nmaceuticals, Lexington, MA, USA) together with appro -\npriate supportive symptomatic care [2, 10–13]. Enzyme \nreplacement therapy with intravenous idursulfase has \nbeen shown to stabilize somatic symptoms of the disease \n[10–12]; however, it does not cross the blood–brain bar -\nrier in therapeutic quantities from intravenous delivery, \nand it is therefore not expected to affect neurological \nsymptoms [14, 15].\nCognitive and adaptive behavioral testing can be used \nto evaluate disease progression, obtain a better under -\nstanding of the patient’s needs and assess the potential \neffects of interventional treatments [16–18]. Several \ntools have been used to assess cognitive and behavio -\nral function in patients with MPS II. The Differential \nAbility Scales, second edition (DAS-II) and the Vine -\nland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-\nII) are comprehensive instruments that have been \nwidely used to measure cognitive function and adaptive \nbehavior, respectively [19, 20]. The Hunter Syndrome-\nFunctional Outcomes for Clinical Understanding Scale \n(HS-FOCUS) is a parent/patient-reported instrument \ndeveloped to measure limitations in physical function -\ning and daily activities specifically in patients with MPS \nII [4]. It has been validated using data from clinical tri -\nals of intravenous idursulfase and has good internal \nconsistency, test–retest reliability and moderate to high \ncorrelation with other widely used health-related quality \nof life instruments [4, 21–23]. However, it is not known \nwhich components of these instruments best measure \ncognitive and adaptive behavioral decline in patients with \nMPS II. In addition, the association between HS-FOCUS \nscores and measurements obtained using the DAS-II and \nVABS-II has not been explored.\nThe neurodevelopmental and functional status of a \npediatric population with MPS II was evaluated in a \n2-year observational study using the DAS-II, VABS-\nII and HS-FOCUS. This post hoc analysis evaluated \nchanges in all components of the DAS-II and VABS-II \nin patients with MPS II with evidence of early cognitive \nimpairment over 2 years in the observational study, and \nassessed associations between measurements using these \ninstruments and those obtained using HS-FOCUS. The \naim was to better understand and interpret cognitive and \nadaptive function changes measured using these tools in \npatients with neuronopathic MPS II.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis post hoc analysis utilized data from a 24-month, \nmultinational, multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, \nobservational study (HGT-HIT-090; ClinicalTrials.gov \nidentifier: NCT01822184). Patients were enrolled at sites \nin five different countries (Argentina, Mexico, Spain, the \nUK and the USA). The primary objective of the observa -\ntional study was to evaluate the neurodevelopmental sta -\ntus of pediatric patients with MPS II over the course of \n2 years.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with Good \nClinical Practice, the International Council for Harmo -\nnisation of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the \nethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The pro -\ntocol and informed consent documents were reviewed \nand approved by the institutional review board and/or \nindependent ethics committee at each site participating \nin this study. Written informed consent was obtained \nfor all patients from their parent(s) or legally authorized \nguardian(s) before any study-related procedures were \nconducted.\nEnrolled patients attended the study site for assess -\nments (including DAS-II, VABS-II and HS-FOCUS) \nat the following visits: screening (day − 30 to day − 1), \nbaseline (day 0) and then at 3-month (± 14  days) inter -\nvals until the month 24 (± 14  days)/end of study visit \n(Fig. 1). If patients withdrew from the study or discontin -\nued participation because of a parent or physician deci -\nsion, assessments due to be conducted at month 24/end \nof study were carried out within 14 days of withdrawal/\ndiscontinuation. Primary assessments were cognitive \nPage 3 of 12\nYee et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:501 \n \nfunction, using the DAS-II, and adaptive behavior, using \nthe VABS-II. Secondary assessments included the HS-\nFOCUS, which measures functional outcomes. Neu -\nrodevelopmental testing was not repeated if it had been \nperformed during the 8  weeks before the end of study \nvisit.\nPatients\nA total of 55 male patients aged 2– < 18 years with a con-\nfirmed diagnosis of MPS II and a DAS-II General Con -\nceptual Ability (GCA) score of at least 55 (normative \nmean, 100; normative standard deviation [SD], 15) at \nscreening were eligible for inclusion in the observational \nstudy which took place from January 2013 to October \n2016. Patients enrolled in the natural history study there-\nfore had a broad range of cognitive abilities at baseline. \nThis post hoc analysis was performed using data from a \nsubgroup of patients with early cognitive impairment, \ndefined as a DAS-II GCA score of 55–85 (below aver -\nage–very low abilities) at any time during the study. \nThese patients were selected to evaluate the ability of \nthe tools to measure changes in cognitive and adaptive \nfunction over time in patients with MPS II and cognitive \nimpairment.\nA diagnosis of MPS II was established by a deficiency \nin I2S enzyme activity of up to 10% of the lower limit of \nnormal, as measured in plasma, fibroblasts or leukocytes, \nand either a documented pathogenic variant of the IDS \ngene that left the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) \nand 2 (FMR2) genes intact or a normal enzyme activ -\nity level of one other sulfatase, as measured in plasma, \nfibroblasts or leukocytes. All patients were required to \nhave sufficient auditory capacity (with the use of hear -\ning aids if required) to complete the study assessments. \nPatients receiving intravenous idursulfase as well as those \nnot receiving idursulfase were eligible for enrollment. \nKey exclusion criteria were participation in an interven -\ntional trial at or during the 30 days before enrollment, or \nthe presence of non-MPS II-related clinically significant \ncentral nervous system involvement, medical comorbidi -\nties or psychiatric comorbidities that could have affected \nadministration, study data, integrity of the results or \ninterpretation of protocol assessments.\nPatients in this observational study could be enrolled in \na phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating intrathecal adminis -\ntration of idursulfase (HGT-HIT-094; ClinicalTrials.gov \nidentifier: NCT02055118) if they met the eligibility crite -\nria. The clinical decision to enroll eligible patients in the \nphase 2/3 trial was based on the judgment of the inves -\ntigator. These patients then discontinued participation in \nthe observational study.\nDAS‑II, VABS‑II and HS‑FOCUS assessment tools\nDAS‑II\nThe DAS-II evaluates cognitive ability in children relative \nto same-age peers and consists of a series of tests admin -\nistered by a qualified psychologist [19]. There are two test \nbatteries; the early years test battery is designed for chil -\ndren aged 2 years 6 months to 6 years 11 months (with a \nlower level for ages 2 years 6 months to 3 years 5 months, \nand an upper level for ages 3 years 6 months to 6 years \nFig. 1 Study design. aIn addition to the assessments performed at baseline shown in the figure, the screening period includes: obtaining/\nevaluating informed consent/assent, inclusion/exclusion criteria, genotyping, demographic information and medical history. bHeight and weight \nwere measured at baseline and at months 12 and 24 only.

This analysis used normalized \nT scores (mean 50, SD 10) for all subtest scores. Cluster \nscores (mean 100, SD 15) were derived from the sum of \ntwo normalized subtest T scores. The GCA composite \nscore was derived from the sum of six subtest T scores \nand normed with a mean of 100 and an SD of 15.\nVABS‑II\nThe VABS-II is a standardized norm-referenced tool \nused to evaluate adaptive behavior in individuals from \n0 to 90  years of age and is administered by a psycholo -\ngist during a semi-structured interview with the patient’s \nparent or caregiver [20]. The VABS-II has one composite \nscore (the Adaptive Behavior Composite [ABC]), which \nprovides an overall measure of adaptive behavior abil -\nity. The ABC comprises four domain scores in patients \nyounger than 7  years old (communication, daily living \nskills, socialization and motor skills) and three domain \nscores in patients 7  years of age or older (communica -\ntion, daily living skills and socialization). The domain \nscores are derived from 11 subdomain scores (Table  1). \nThe ABC and domain scores have a normative mean of \n100, with an SD of 15. The subdomain scores (V scale) \nare normed with a mean of 15 and an SD of 3.\nHS‑FOCUS\nThe HS-FOCUS is an MPS II-specific tool used to \nevaluate functional status based on parent-/caregiver-  \ncompleted and patient self-reported questionnaires [4, \n21, 22]. A shortened version of the questionnaire devel -\noped to decrease respondent burden was used in this \nobservational study [21]. The HS-FOCUS shortened par -\nent-/caregiver-completed version assesses functional sta -\ntus in five domains (walking/standing, grip/reach, school/\nwork, activities and breathing) comprised 21 items \nTable 1 Components of the DAS-II and VABS-II assessment tools\nABC Adaptive Behavior Composite; DAS-II Differential Ability Scales, second edition; EY early years (2 years 6 months–6 years 11 months); GCA  General Conceptual \nAbility; SA school age (7 years–17 years 11 months); SD standard deviation; SNC Special Nonverbal Composite; VABS-II Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second \nedition\na The DAS-II early years test battery comprises a lower level for children aged 2 years 6 months to 3 years 5 months and an upper level for those aged 3 years 6 months \nto 6 years 11 months\nb DAS-II composite/cluster scores and subtest scores are normed on different scales and ABC/domain scores and subdomain scores are also normed on different scales\nc Composite scores were the sums of subtest T scores normed; cluster scores were the sum of two normalized subtest T scores\nd Normalized T scores were used for all subtest scores\nDAS‑II VABS‑II\nComposite scores GCA (overall score of cognitive performance)\n Derived from verbal and non-verbal cluster scores \n(all), and spatial cluster score (upper  EYa and SA \nonly)\n SNC (similar to GCA but does not include verbal \ntests)\nABC (overall score of adaptive behavioral ability)\n Derived from all four domains for patients aged < 7 years \nand from three domains (motor skills excluded) for \npatients aged ≥ 7 years\nCluster/domain scores and com-\nponent subtest/subdomain scores\nVerbal\n  Verbal comprehension (EY)\n  Naming vocabulary (EY)\n  Word definitions (SA)\n  Verbal similarities (SA)\nNon-verbal\n  Picture similarities (EY)\n  Matrices (EY and SA)\n  Sequential and quantitative reasoning (SA)\nSpatial\n  Copying (EY)\n  Pattern construction (EY and SA)\n  Recall of designs (SA)\nCommunication\n  Receptive\n  Expressive\n  Written\nDaily living skills\n  Personal\n  Domestic\n  Community\nSocialization\n  Interpersonal relationships\n  Play and leisure time\n  Coping skills\nMotor skills\n  Gross\n  Fine\nNormative mean (SD)b Composite and cluster scores: 100 (15)c\nSubtest scores: 50 (10)d\nABC and domain scores: 100 (15)\nSubdomain scores: 15 (3)\nPage 5 of 12\nYee et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:501 \n \n(reduced from 68 items in the original instrument) [21]. \nEach item is scored using the following response scale: \n0 = with no difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with \nmuch difficulty, 3 = unable to do. Higher scores corre -\nspond to worse functional capacity. Self-report question -\nnaires were not used in this study because of the young \nage and low cognitive ability of many of the patients.\nThe shortened version of the HS-FOCUS has accept -\nable internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s \nalpha > 0.70) and test–retest reliability (intraclass cor -\nrelation coefficient for most domains > 0.70, the set cri -\nterion for good reliability), and moderate (> 0.3) to high \n(> 0.6) Spearman correlations with the Childhood Health \nAssessment Questionnaire, Childhood Health Question -\nnaire and Health Utilities Index [21, 23].\nStatistical methods\nGraphs were plotted for mean DAS-II GCA and VABS-\nII ABC scores (± 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) over \ntime. To ensure that measurement scales were compara -\nble, the mean percentage change from baseline was also \nevaluated for all DAS-II and VABS-II subtest/subdomain, \ncluster/domain and composite scores (which are normed \non different scales). Items in the HS-FOCUS were ordinal \nvariables and stacked column plots were therefore pro -\nduced to show changes in functional abilities over time.\nA mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) \nwas performed to identify associations between baseline \nvariables (age, genotype, cognitive function and hearing \nimpairment) and composite DAS-II GCA and VABS-II \nABC scores measured over time for up to 2  years. The \nMMRM was also used to provide adjusted graphical plots \nfor all components of the DAS-II and VABS-II (subtest/\nsubdomain, cluster/domain and composite scores) and all \nitems and domains of the HS-FOCUS to compare trends. \nThere was no adjustment for alpha in these multiple \ngroup comparisons. In addition, the MMRM was used to \nevaluate associations between DAS-II GCA and VABS-II \nABC scores and HS-FOCUS items, while controlling for \nwithin-patient correlations and any associated baseline \nvariables. The purpose of these analyses was to establish \nany associated trends between measurements of cogni -\ntive ability, adaptive behavior and functional outcomes \nspecific to MPS II. For the MMRM statement, com -\npound symmetry was selected for the covariance struc -\nture because it provided a better model fit (based on the \nAkaike information criterion) [24] than an unstructured \ncovariance structure.\nResults\nStudy population\nIn total, 38 of the 55 patients in the observational \nstudy had evidence of early cognitive impairment as \ndetermined by a DAS-II GCA score of 55–85 at any time \nduring the study and were included in this analysis. Most \npatients were younger than 7  years old (27/38, 71.1%) \nand their median (range) age at baseline was 4.90  years \n(2.11–16.74) (Table  2). IDS genotypes in order of fre -\nquency were missense/presumed missense (20/38, 52.6%) \nfollowed by presumed splice site/splice site (9/38, 23.7%), \nframeshift (3/38, 7.9%), nonsense (3/38, 7.9%), prema -\nture truncated (2/38, 5.3%) and large deletion (1/38, \n2.6%).

The \nmean (SD) baseline VABS-II ABC score was 81.8 (11.8), \nindicating moderately low adaptive function (normative \nmean 100, SD 15). Overall, 19 of the 38 patients (50%) \nincluded in this analysis discontinued participation in the \nobservational study to enroll in the phase 2/3 intrathe -\ncal idursulfase trial. A further four patients discontinued \nparticipation from the observational study for other rea -\nsons. Patient flow through the study is shown in Addi -\ntional file 1: Fig. S1.\nDAS‑II\nThe mean (SD [95% CI]) DAS-II early years GCA score \ndecreased throughout the study, from 73.4 (15.7 [66.4, \n80.3], n = 22) at baseline to 62.7 (34.9 [26.1, 99.2], n = 6) \nat month 24 (Fig.  2). For the six patients with assess -\nments available at both baseline and month 24, mean \n(SD [95% CI]) early years GCA score was 72.3 (21.3 [50.0, \n94.7]) at baseline and 62.7 (34.9 [26.1, 99.2]) at month \n24. Individual DAS-II GCA scores were also plotted for \nthese patients (Additional file  1: Fig. S2), however no \nclear patterns were observed. The mean (SD [95% CI]) \nschool age GCA score was 72.4 (11.8 [63.9, 80.9], n = 10) \nat baseline and 74.3 (12.3 [63.9, 84.6], n = 8) at month \n24. Individual DAS-II GCA scores by visit are shown in \nAdditional file 1: Table S1.\nNo baseline variables were significantly associated \nwith percentage change from baseline for GCA scores, \nand therefore none were included in the MMRM model \nto produce the plots of adjusted least-squares mean \npercentage change from baseline for comparison of \nDAS-II subtest and cluster/composite scores. Adjusted \nleast-squares mean percentage changes from baseline in \nDAS-II early years verbal and spatial cluster and the pat -\ntern construction and picture similarities subtest scores \nfollowed a similar trend to the early years GCA score, \ndecreasing over the 24  months (Fig.  3A, B, Additional \nfile  1: Fig. S3). Exceptions to this were the early years \nnon-verbal reasoning ability cluster score (which was sta-\nble for the first 18  months before decreasing), the early \nyears copying, verbal comprehension and matrices sub -\ntest scores (which declined at a greater rate than the early \nyears GCA score) and the naming vocabulary subtest \nscore (which decreased over the first 18 months of obser-\nvations, but increased at 21 and 24 months).\nAdjusted least-squares mean percentage changes from \nbaseline in DAS-II school age cluster scores including \nverbal, non-verbal reasoning ability and spatial scores \nfollowed a similar trend to the school age GCA score, \nremaining stable over the 24  months (Fig.  3C, D, Addi-\ntional file  1: Fig. S4). School age subtest scores also fol -\nlowed a similar trend, remaining stable, except for the \npattern construction and matrices subtest scores, which \nimproved over 24 months. For the verbal similarities sub-\ntest, the scores were highly variable and the model was \nnot able to converge (Additional file 1: Fig. S4F).\nSome DAS-II assessments recorded for patients in this \nstudy were at the floor (the lowest possible score), but \nnever in all six subtests at the same visit. The most com -\nmon subtest with floor scores for patients assessed with \nthe early years battery was copying; the most common \nsubtest with floor scores among patients completing the \nschool age battery was verbal similarities.\nVABS‑II\nVABS-II ABC standard scores were stable over the study \nperiod, with a mean (SD) score of 81.8 (11.8, n = 36) at \nbaseline and 81.0 (10.2, n = 13) at 24 months. While the \nmean ABC score was below one SD of the population \nmean, the ABC scores ranged between 3 SDs below the \nmean and 1 SD above the mean during the 24-month \nobservation period. Age was the only baseline variable \nsignificantly associated with ABC score and, therefore, \nwas included in the MMRM analysis for subdomain and \nFig. 2 Mean DAS-II GCA and VABS-II ABC standard scores: A DAS-II \nearly years and school age GCA scores; B VABS-II ABC scores. \nABC Adaptive Behavior Composite; CI confidence interval; DAS-II \nDifferential Ability Scales, second edition; EY early years (2 years \n6 months–6 years 11 months); GCA  General Conceptual Ability; SA \nschool age (7 years–17 years 11 months); VABS-II Vineland Adaptive \nBehavior Scales, second edition\nPage 7 of 12\nYee et al.

An exception was the \nsocialization interpersonal relationships subdomain \nscore, which varied widely over all study visits (Addi -\ntional file 1: Fig. S8A).\nHS‑FOCUS\nThere was no clear pattern of change in HS-FOCUS \nitems over the 24 months of the observational study, with \nlittle variability in the responses of parents/caregivers for \nmany of these items. A high functional performance was \nreported at baseline, with over 50% of caregivers report -\ning ‘no difficulty’ for 11 of the 21 items. For example, at \nbaseline, 11/14 (79%) of parents/caregivers reported \nthat their children had ‘no difficulty’ attending a full day \nof school or work, and 3/14 (21%) reported only ‘some \ndifficulty’ (Fig.  5A). Similar high baseline values were \nreported for other HS-FOCUS items, including the abil -\nity to take part in physical activities for 1 h (Fig.  5B), go \nout with friends and/or family (Fig.  5C), do daily activi -\nties without losing breath, talk to someone without losing \nbreath, throw/catch a medium-sized ball, turn pages in a \nbook, walk up a flight of stairs and stand without getting \ntired for 10 min.\nIn contrast, items within the grip/reach domain \ndifferentiated varying levels of functional ability \n(Fig.  5D). At baseline, when caregivers were asked \nwhether their children could reach all parts of their \nbody, 2/13 (15.4%), 3/13 (23.1%) and 5/13 (38.5%) \nreported ‘no difficulty’ , ‘some difficulty’ and ‘much dif -\nficulty’ , respectively, and 3/13 (23.1%) stated that they \nwere unable to reach all parts of their body.

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:501 \nAssociations between DAS‑II GCA, VABS‑II ABC \nand HS‑FOCUS scores\nThere was a significant positive association between \nDAS-II GCA and VABS-II ABC standard scores \n(β = 0.1104; p = 0.0316). For HS-FOCUS, percentage \nchange from baseline could not be evaluated as the out -\ncome variable because values for some items were not \navailable at baseline (e.g. when parents had reported ‘not \napplicable’ for items such as schoolwork and walking). \nTherefore, associations between HS-FOCUS and DAS-II \nGCA and VABS-II ABC scores were investigated using \nraw scores for each item and domain.\nThe DAS-II GCA score was significantly (p < 0.05) and \nnegatively associated with two of the five domains and \nfive of the 21 items of the HS-FOCUS (Table  3), indicat-\ning that increasing cognitive function is associated with \nbetter functional abilities. For the VABS-II ABC score, \nthere was a significant (p < 0.05) negative association with \ntwo domains and three items of the HS-FOCUS, suggest-\ning that increasing adaptive behavior was associated with \nimproved functional performance.\nDiscussion\nThis post hoc analysis examined changes in cognitive \nfunction, adaptive behavior and functional outcomes in \npatients with MPS II and early cognitive impairment over \n2 years of follow-up, as assessed using the DAS-II, VABS-\nII and HS-FOCUS, respectively. The aim of our analysis \nwas to better understand the ability of these instruments \nto measure changes in patients with neuronopathic MPS \nII in a natural history setting, and thus inform the analy -\nsis and interpretation of data collected using these tools \nin clinical trials.\nThe DAS-II has been used to assess cognitive ability in \nseveral studies of patients with MPS II and is considered \nan appropriate tool for measuring the effect of treatment \non cognitive outcomes in individuals with the disease in \nclinical trials [16–18, 25]. The DAS-II GCA score meas -\nures cognitive ability relative to a normative sample of \nsame-age, typically developing peers and does not pro -\nvide information on absolute changes in performance \nover time [26]. A decrease in an individual’s GCA score \nmay reflect deteriorating cognitive function, stabilization \nFig. 5 Parent/caregiver responses to HS-FOCUS items assessing ability to (A) attend a full day of school or work, (B) take part in physical activities \nfor 1 h, (C) go out with friends and/or family and (D) reach all parts of their body. Data for all HS-FOCUS items are shown in Additional file 1: Figure \nS9. HS-FOCUS Hunter Syndrome-Functional Outcomes for Clinical Understanding Scale\nPage 9 of 12\nYee et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:501 \n \nof cognitive development or below-average improve -\nment in cognitive ability [26]. In this analysis, DAS-II \nearly years GCA scores decreased over the 2-year study \nperiod, whereas DAS-II school age GCA scores remained \nstable. These results suggest that the DAS-II was able to \nmeasure changes in cognitive function in the younger \npatients assessed with the early years test battery in this \nstudy over 2  years. The different pattern of changes in \nGCA score over time in the two age groups may have \nimplications for the use of this measure in clinical trial \nendpoints for investigational treatments. In younger chil-\ndren, stabilization or a smaller decrease in GCA score \nmay be sufficient to demonstrate a treatment effect over \nat least 2  years, whereas in older children it is possible \nthat gains in GCA score would need to be shown.\nTo help overcome the challenges associated with \ninterpreting changes in GCA scores and to allow \ncharacterization of absolute changes in norm-based \nability test scores, the Projected Retained Ability Score \n(PRAS) was recently developed and retrospectively \napplied to DAS-II GCA scores in three children with \nMPS II from this observational study [26]. Among chil -\ndren with relative declines in norm-based GCA scores, \nthe PRAS method was able to distinguish between \ndeteriorating cognitive function, stabilization of cogni -\ntive development and below-average improvement in \ncognitive ability [26]. Mathematical methods have been \nproposed for evaluating the statistical reliability of differ -\nences in GCA/PRAS scores as well as the extent to which \nthey are clinically meaningful [26]. Further research is \nrequired to increase our understanding of the validity \nand clinical applications of PRAS in measuring absolute \nchanges in cognitive function in patients with MPS II.\nTable 3 Associations between DAS-II GCA and VABS-II ABC standard scores and HS-FOCUS items\nBold font indicates statistically significant associations and asterisks denote p values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:501 \nThe content validity of the DAS-II in different popula -\ntions with MPS II has not yet been fully established and \nis important if this tool is to be widely used for assessing \ntreatment effects in patients with this condition [27]. It is \nnot yet known whether the DAS-II is equally suitable for \nyounger and older children with greater or lesser degrees \nof cognitive impairment. Younger children with MPS II \nmay experience an early cognitive decline and then stabi -\nlize in terms of developmental gains at a more expected \nrate as they grow older. It would be valuable to define a \nmore specific age when children with neuronopathic \nMPS II experience cognitive decline and stabilization, \nhowever this was not possible with the data available \nfrom this natural history study.\nIn patients with MPS II and low cognitive function at \nbaseline, the activities of daily living domain from the \nVABS-II instrument would be expected to decline signifi-\ncantly over time for children older than 6 years of age [8]. \nHowever, in this analysis, VABS-II scores remained rela -\ntively stable over 2 years. This may be because the VABS-\nII is not sensitive enough to detect small changes in \nyoung children with MPS II and moderately low adaptive \nbehavior at baseline (mean VABS-II ABC standard score \nof 81.8). Parents/caregivers providing responses for the \nVABS-II may also be unable to detect small changes after \nadaptation to their child’s behavior. Changes in adaptive \nbehavior measured by the VABS-II may be more appar -\nent when assessed beyond a 2-year period and could still \nbe a measurement of interest over longer periods of time.\nThe VABS has been considered an appropriate tool \nfor assessing adaptive behavior in clinical trials evaluat -\ning the effect of treatment in children with MPS II [18]. \nThe content validity of the VABS has not been extensively \nstudied in the context of MPS II, however, therefore fur -\nther research may be needed to confirm whether this is \na sufficiently sensitive tool to measure adaptive behavior \nin these patients [27]. Additional limitations of the VABS \ninclude those inherent in an instrument based on par -\nent/caregiver responses, variability of results depending \non the administrator, existing parental expectations and \nother factors that can affect parental observations of the \nchild’s behavior.\nThere was no clear pattern of change in most HS-\nFOCUS items over the 2-year study period, and high \nfunctional performance was reported for items at base -\nline. This indicates that the items were not sensitive \nenough to differentiate between patients with various \nlevels of functional performance, creating a ceiling effect. \nIn contrast, items within the grip/reach domain showed \nsensitivity in detecting varying levels of functional dif -\nficulties in patients with MPS II, possibly owing to the \nspecificity of the questions asked and high number of \nitems included in this domain.\nThe shortened version of the HS-FOCUS question -\nnaire used in this study has previously been described \nas a valid and reliable tool with which to assess the \nimpact of MPS II on physical functioning [23]. How -\never, the activities domain of the HS-FOCUS has a \nslightly lower test–retest reliability in the shortened \nversion, which contains only two items [23]. Respon -\nsiveness to changes in physical functioning and activity \nlimitations was not evaluated during the validation of \nthis tool [23]. In addition, the HS-FOCUS was validated \nusing data from patients with a mean age of 10.8 years \n[23], whereas most patients in this study were younger \nthan 7  years old at baseline. Some HS-FOCUS items \nand domains may not be sensitive to early functional \ndecline in very young children with MPS II or may not \nmeasure specific disease burden in patients this young. \nOther limitations of the HS-FOCUS include the lack of \nobjectivity inherent in assessments based on parent/\ncaregiver responses and the fact that caregivers may \nfind it difficult to observe functions for some items, \nsuch as snoring while sleeping. In the longer version of \nthe HS-FOCUS, sleep questions were removed [21].\nThere was a statistically significant association between \nDAS-II GCA scores and VABS-II ABC standard scores \nafter controlling for the within-patient correlation. DAS-\nII GCA was significantly negatively associated with seven \ndomains/items of the HS-FOCUS and the VABS II ABC \nwas associated with five domains/items. This indicates \nthat functional performance in patients with MPS II \nreflects cognitive development and adaptive behavior to \nsome extent. The magnitude of these associations, how -\never, could not be determined from this analysis. Further \nresearch into HS-FOCUS items associated with adaptive \nbehavior and cognitive function is required.\nLimitations of this analysis included those inherent in \npost hoc analyses and the small sample size, which was \nfurther affected by the loss of patients over time who \ndiscontinued involvement in the observational study \nto enroll in a phase 2/3 study of intrathecally delivered \nidursulfase. The patient population who remained in \nthe natural history study at 2  years may therefore have \nhad different characteristics from those who originally \nentered the study. Data were not available for every \npatient at each visit, which, together with the discontinu -\nation of patients, resulted in missing data values during \nthe study. In addition, patients were followed for 2 years, \nwhich may not have been long enough to record changes \nin all measures. The content validity of the assessment \ntools used in this analysis for MPS II has also not yet \nbeen fully established. Several challenges are associated \nwith assessing cognitive function and adaptive behavior \nin children with MPS disorders, including difficulties in \nmeasuring changes in cognitive function in individuals \nPage 11 of 12\nYee et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:501 \n \nwith neurodegenerative disease, and the interference \nof sensory, motor and behavioral problems caused by \nsomatic disease manifestations with neurocognitive test -\ning results [28, 29]. Work is ongoing to develop an MPS \nII-specific neurobehavioral rating scale [30]. An instru -\nment for which measurement is not confounded by \ninherent physical disabilities in the disease would help \nclinicians to obtain a more accurate measurement of cog-\nnitive abilities in children with MPS II [29].\nConclusions\nFindings from this post hoc analysis provide data to \ninform the selection of cognitive, behavioral and func -\ntional assessment tools for future clinical trials in patients \nwith MPS II. The DAS-II results indicated changes in \ncognitive ability in younger children assessed with the \nearly years test battery over the 2-year study, whereas \ncognitive function remained stable in older children \nassessed with the school age test battery, suggesting that \nage-specific clinical trial endpoints may be needed. The \nVABS-II and HS-FOCUS may not be appropriate clini -\ncal trial endpoints for measuring behavioral or functional \nchanges over a 2-year period. Further validation stud -\nies and novel tools and approaches, such as the PRAS \nmethod, may play an important role in improving assess -\nment of cognitive function and behavior in patients with \nMPS II.\nAbbreviations\nABC: Adaptive Behavior Composite; CI: Confidence interval; DAS-II: Differential \nAbility Scales, second edition; GCA : General Conceptual Ability; HS-FOCUS: \nHunter Syndrome-Functional Outcomes for Clinical Understanding Scale; I2S: \nIduronate-2-sulfatase; MMRM: Mixed-effects model for repeated measures; \nMPS: Mucopolysaccharidosis; PRAS: Projected Retained Ability Score; SD: \nStandard deviation; VABS-II: Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, second edition.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s13023- 021- 02118-3.\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.
