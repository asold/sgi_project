Introduction \n \nIn recent years, with the rapid development of substation automation and network \ncommunication technology, especially the promulgation and implementation  of the IEC \n61850 standard,  the traditional substation has shown gradual transition to a digital substation. \nElectronic voltage transformer s (EVT) and electronic current transformer s (ECT) are \nimportant instruments in digital substations [1-3]. Their outputs are sent to the merging unit \n(MU) of transformer s, and digital signal s are converted into  the data bus serving for \nsubstation monitoring , relay protec tion and control systems, so  reliability can reach 99%.  \nBased on the IEC60044-7/8 standards, the electronic transformer secondary output is divided \ninto two kinds of digital output and analog ou tput [4-5]. However, traditional calibration \nequipment cannot meet the requirements. This motivates some study of calibration systems of \nelectronic instrument transformers [6-9]. \nCalibration systems with digital output and analog output  are used to replace conventional \ncalibration systems because of the principle of diversity and characteris tics of  EVT/ECT. \nTherefore mainly considering the factors influencing the accuracy of the calibration system \nand employing  a simple but reliable structure ,  a n on-site calibration system for electronic \ninstrument transformers is designed with a rated voltage of 10 to 500 kV of EVT and a rated \ncurrent of 5 to 5000 A of ECT. In the system, an Agilent 3458A digital multimeter is used to \n \n M. Zhang,  K. Li, J. Wang , S. He : AN ON-SITE CALIBRATION SYSTEM FOR  ELECTRONIC  INSTRUMENT… \n \n \ngreatly expand the sampling  precision to improve the accuracy  and reliability. For data \nacquisition to obtain simultaneous measurement s,  the self-developed PCI synchronization \ncard can provide pulse synchronization signals   to synchronize the reference and tested \nchannels of the system.  The human-computer interface and analysis algorithm are designed \nbased on LabVIEW , which can make a r eal-time display of the waveform, frequency, \namplitude, phase, and other data to facilitate comprehensive analysis of transformer \nperformance. On the other hand , software exploiting , debugging and improving are easier, \ncompared with the hardware circuit. It not only accelerates progress in the development, but \nalso improves the stability of the product  [10-11]. The system has achieved a high accuracy    \nof EVT/ECT calibration, which enhances both the flexibility of digital signal processing and \nthe computing speed as well. To improve the measurement accuracy,  the Hanning window \ninterpolation FFT (HWIpFFT) algorithm is used. It  not only meets the requirements of high-\nprecision sampling, but also is  not sensitive  to high frequency interference and frequency \nfluctuation of the tested signal. \n The combination of the key technologies  which were proposed in the paper is the most \nimportant feature to realize high accuracy and also the contributions of the paper. The paper is \norganized as follows.  Section 2 elaborates the theory and design proposal of the system .               \nThe design of the on-site calibration system is presented first and then the  scheme of the key \ntechnologies is discussed  in Section 3. Then experiment  results are presented and discussed \nin Section 4. At last, the conclusions are given in Section 5. \n \n2. Principle and structure \n \nIn this paper, according to  the IEC 60044-7/8 standard , the on-site calibration system                \nof electronic instrument transformers is designed to  estimate the  measuring accuracy  of the \ntested EVT/ECT.  The block diagrams of the calibration system are shown in Fig s. 1 and 2. \nThey describe the system principle  and structure  of testing of EVT/ECT, respectively. \nThe proposed calibration system contains a reference channel, a  test ed channel, and a  \ntesting  device. In Fig . 1, the reference channel includes the standard voltage transformer \n(VT), and \n2\n18 digital multimeter (Agilent 3458A for analog-to-digital conversion).  In Fig. 2, \nthe reference channel includes the standard current transformer (CT), sampling resistor, and \nAgilent 3458A . The standard CT would provide an output current, and then throu gh the \nsampling resistor, the Agilent digital multimeter with data acquisition  functions can acquire \nthe signal and ensure high accuracy . In Figs. 1 and 2, the tested channel includes the tested \nEVT/ECT and MU. The signal from the tested EVT/ECT is sampled  on the high voltage side \nof power systems, then sampling results are transmitted to the MU by the optical fiber.  \nThe data reception of the reference and  tested channels  is charged by  the testing device \nbased on an industrial personal computer ( IPC), which has a PCI-GPIB  (general purpose \ninterface bus) card and an Ethernet interface. Using a self-developed  clock synchronization \ncard, the IPC transmits pulse synchronization signal s to achieve the synchronization of data \nacquisition.  Then, the  IPC begins receiving 10 cycles of data  from the two  channels every \ntime and stores them in order. In the I PC, Labview is used as the unified software platform  \nfor  computing, s aving, calling, and displaying , which provides a convenient way for the \nproposed calibration system. Thus, the development program is characterized by the use                \nof software  to calibrate the tested EVT/ECT with the standard transformer . A number                   \nof  measurements can be performed, for example ratio error, phase error, frequency, harmonic \ncontent about two sets of data using the HWIpFFT algorithm. \n \nMetrol.

Design  \n \nFurthermore, the proposed calibration system combines the signal conversion unit ,  data \nacquisition unit, signal synchronization unit, IPC, and LabVIEW software programs and  so \non. In the s ystem, signal acquisition, signal synchronization and other hardware  are \nconcentrated in an IPC in which signal processing and other functions are implemented by the \nLabview software.  \n \n3.1. Hardware Design \n \n(1) Signal conversion unit (I/V conversion). The unit is individually set f or CT calibration. \nThe  secondary current output signal s of the standard CT  (with accuracy 0. 02 class) are \nconverted to voltage signal s  by the high precision sampling resistor  (\n1 with 0.01 accuracy \nclass),   so that the Agilent  digital multimeter can  read data properly.  \n \n M. Zhang,  K. Li, J. Wang , S. He : AN ON-SITE CALIBRATION SYSTEM FOR  ELECTRONIC  INSTRUMENT… \n \n \n(2) Data acquisition unit. The Agilent 3458A digital multimeter is the fastest, most flexible, \nand most accurate multimeter offered by  Agilent Technologies, which is important to  be  \ncompatible with  LabVIEW software. It  is  used  to  measure the input signal s as  an A/D \nconverter of the reference channel.  It can provide  an  effective precision of 24 bits with  the  \nleast significant bit weighted 2 -23. The error of  the  test setup  is  small enough to be ignored \nwhen it is used for verification of the calibration. MUs are used  to merge and synchronize the \nsampled voltage/current signals and transmit these data to IEDs (intelligent electronic \ndevices). The model of the MU used in the paper is OEMU702 . It  supports connectons to \nEVT/ECT and electro-magnetic VT/CT.  And i t can  also operate as an A/D and D/A \nconverter in a substation between the ECT/EVT and convent ional VT/CT to deliver \nsynchronized signals to busbar protect ion and transformer protect ion. The technical data                \nof OEMU702 is shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1.

The key of t he calibration system is also reflected on the \npulse synchronization signal s.  The a cquisition process must be synchronized sampling, or \nelse the calculation result s will lack  any sense . The PCI synchronization card  is self-\ndeveloped, based on the ARM7 mi crocontroller (LPC2214). The synchronization error limit \ncan be less than ± 1μs  if  each MU shall be able to compensate the signal delay . The card is \ninserted in the IPC PCI slot, and can output four synchronous pulses of the 2-channel \nelectrical signals and 2-channel optical signals. So, it is easy to be used to meet the diffe rent \nsynchronization needs of MUs.  The  block diagram of the PCI synchronization card is shown \nin Fig.3. As shown in Fig.3, we design a serial port  in the card, which is for serial \ncommunication between the PCI synchronization card and IPC. It can be convenient and \nflexible to use a different PC.  \nLevel\nTranslation\nOptical \nSignals\nPCI  Synchronization  Card\nSerial \nCommunication\nSignal \nProcessing\nO/E PCI\nInterface\nI/O\nElectrical \nSignals\nPower\nIPC\nRS232\nLED\nO/E\nLPC2214 PCI\n \nFig. 3.

Therefore, the IPC  uses a  clock synchronization signal to control s ynchronous \nsampling of the two  channels. The two channels start sampling when they receive the \nsynchronizing pulse generated by the synchronization card. The optical synchronization pulse \nsignal (or electrical synchronization pulse signal) is used for  the MU clock synchronization, \nso that the sampling beats of  the MU  are synchronous with Agilent 3458A . So, t his will \nconfirm the synchronization of the signals that are from the reference and tested channels, and \nit can make sure that the follow-up analysis is correct. \n \n \nt2>500ms10us<t1<500ms\nT=1s\nOptical Power \n100%\n50%\n0%\n       t\n       \n       \n Synchronous  Moment  Synchronous  Moment\n \n \nFig. 4.

If  the difference between adjacent pulses  interval time \nand the ideal interval time (1s)  is larger than  10μs, the synchronization signal is a bnormal, \nthen the synchronization state  sent  out according to   IEC61850-9 is “1”.  Otherwise,  the \nMUs can be synchronized  and send out the synchronization state  as “0” according to \nIEC61850-9.  \n(4) Interfaces. The GPIB interface  and Ethernet interface  can improve reliability  and \nconvenient access interface  of the calibration system . And h igh-speed data t ransfer can be \ncarried out by these interfaces in the system too. The NI PCI-GPIB communication card is \nused ,  inserted in the IPC PCI slot . It can  facilitate the  connection between the IPC and \nAgilent 3458A. Further,  it is important that  LabVIEW software supports GPIB and Ethernet  \nprotocols.  \n \n M. Zhang,  K. Li, J. Wang , S.

Calibration software design \n \nThe calibration software is used to mainly perform two tasks: the communication between \nthe IPC and local  instruments, and data analysis. The software flowchart is shown in Fig. 5. \nThe calibration system interface is designed by LabVIEW software, and software interface \nconsists of three parts : parameter setting interface, data analysis interface and parameter \nanalysis interface. \nParameter setting interface shown in Fig . 6 is to complete  calibration parameters setting, \nincluding  digital/analog transformer selection,  system rated primary/secondary value setting, \nsystems protocol selection, calibration channel selection and calibration times. \n  \n \nMetrol.

In the time domain analysis, frequency, amplitude, phase angle, and other parameters \nof the two channels ’ signals  would be calculated. For the frequency  domain analysis, it can \nautomatically analyze the amplitude spectrum of the two channels’ signals from DC, 2 to 20 \nharmonics, then calculate the harmonic ratio (HR), total harmonic distortion (THD) of them. \nHR is the ratio of the amplitude of the kth harmonic to the amplitude of the first harmonic \n(fundamental frequency component). The HR is usually expressed in percent, for a voltage \nsignal, which can equivalently be written as  \n \n M. Zhang,  K. Li, J. Wang , S.

The THD is also usually expressed i n percent, for a \nvoltage signal, which can equivalently be written as  \n \n                                                     \n1\nH\nU\nUTHD   ,                                                                       (2) \nwhere \nHU is the square root of all higher harmonic frequencies,  given by  \n\n\n\nN\nk\nkk UUUUU\n2\n222\n3\n2\n2H \n. \nAt last, the results of time domain and frequency domain analysis are shown to facilitate a \ncomparative analysis of transformer performance. \n \n \n \n(a)                                                                                        (b) \nFig. 8.

System communication   \n \nSystem communication refers to communication between the calibration system and the \nMU. With the strong construction of the digital substation, the communication protocol of the \nMU tends to be standardized  using the IEC 61850 -9 standard  [12-13].  In th e software               \ndesign of the calibration system , it  is compatible with  three protocols                                                          \n{ IEC61850 (-9-1, -9-2,-9-2LE) }. So, the system can be flexible to select the communication \nprotocol to calibrate the e lectronic  instrument transformers with various communication \nmodes, and provide full frame resolution to automatically analyze ASDU (application service \ndata unit) data.  \n  \n \nMetrol. Meas. Syst., Vol. XXI (2014), No. 2, pp. 257–270. \n \n \n3.2.3 Error calculation algorithm with HWIpFFT \n \nAs  it  is  well  known, actual power signals are not ideal. They can be  considered  as  the  \nsum  of  a  series  of  different components superimposed over a fundamental component , and \nthe amplitude of a harmonic is generally a few percent of that of the fundamental or smaller.  \nWhen non-synchronous sampling is done on the actual signal, the spectrum  leakage will \nseriously affect the fundamental frequency component  by the FFT, resulting in great  error of \nthe calibration system. A nd the large-amplitude harmonic  components also can overwhelm \nthe small ones. An appropriate window function and interpolation algorithm can improve the \naccuracy of the FFT. \nInterpolation FFT(IpFFT) is a well known technique that allows improving the parameter \nestimation accuracy of a non-synchronous sampling signal. By convoluting the used window \nfunction spectrum with a non-synchronous sampli ng signal, a theoretical function for the \nexpected spectrum of the FFT peaks is obtained. Thus interpolating the FFT peaks with this \nfunction will result in improved parameter estimation. For real-time use, the algorithm must \nhave a tradeoff between accura cy and execution time.  In this paper, t he selected Ip FFT \nalgorithm is a two-point algorithm using the Hanning window [14].  \nConsider a sampled monofrequency signal \n                                                \n )2sin()(   tfkAtkx ,                                                  (3) \nwhere \n1,,2,1,0  Nk  ,\nf  is  the  frequency, \nA  is the amplitude, \n  is  the phase angle,  and  \nt\n is  the  sampling  interval.

(a) \n01  . (b) \n5.01  .  \n \n \n \n3.3 Uncertainty of the system \n \nThere are three main factors of uncertainty of the calibration system: the standard VT/CT, \nthe digital sampling system and the error calculation method. \nThe standard VT/CT uncertainty can be measured by  comparing with a much more \naccurate reference transducer.  The uncertainty of the standard VT is found to be less than \n0.01% for ratio error and 0.2 min for phase error. The uncertainty of the standard CT i s less \nthan 0.02% for ratio error and 0.3 min for phase error. The sampling resistor is used as the \nrated secondary burden of the standard CT and as the converter from current to voltage which \nsupplies the Agilent 3458A with proper voltage value. The resistor was tested by the precision \nimpedance analyzer. The relative error of the resistance is less than 0.01%. \nThe calibration system requires not only high resolution but also low uncertainty.                    \nTo assure low uncertainty,  the Agilent 3458A digital multimeter  is used. It can achieve                 \nlow-uncertainty performance with 100 ppm best accuracy for AC voltages. And it has the \ndigital sampling function and external trigger synchronous sampling mode, which can ensure \nsampling accuracy ( signal amplitude) and sampling synchronization (signal delay). The \nquantization error and nonlinearity error of the AD converters in the  Agilent 3458A can be \nneglected since their effects are usually negligible[15]. \nLeakage effects happen when the sampling  rate is not an exact multiple of the frequency     \nof the voltage or current that is applied to the primary of the reference and tested transformers. \nThe windows technique and phase difference correction method can greatly reduce the \neffects. Thus the HWIpFFT algorithm can analyze the signals with very high accuracy, which \nis normally less than 0.05%[14]. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMetrol. Meas.

In order to individually verify   the tested EVT, it s \naccuracy can be measured in a large range  of voltages by comparing it to  the standard VT \nwith an accuracy of class 0.02. The ratio error  \nu  is defined as [4] \n                                               \n 100-%)(\np\npsn\nu  U\nUUK ,                                                      (8) \nwhere \nnK is the rated transformation  ratio, \npU  is the (RMS) value of the primary voltage, \nsU  \nis the RMS value of the secondary voltage. The general definition for the phase error \nu  is \n                                                      \nps -)rad(  u ,                                                              (9) \nwhere \np  is the phase  angle of the primary voltage, \ns  is the phase angle of the secondary \nvoltage. \n ECT testing  is performed in the same way as the EVT testing[5]. \n \n4.2. Type test \n \nIn order to test the correctness of the calibration system, the following tests are done in the \nlaboratory. A FLUKE 5720A multifunction calibrator as a standard signal source combines \nwith the calibration system to measure the ratio error and phase error , which can provide two \nstandard voltage signal s.

According to IEC60044 -7, voltage at the 80%～120% of rated voltage must meet \nthe accuracy requirements for the tested EVT . Test results are shown  in Fig .12 (transformer \ntype: EVT; test channel: A phase; rated transformation ratio  of measuring voltage:                        \n \nMetrol. Meas.

According to IEC60044 -8, \ncurrent at the  5 ~ 120% of rated current   must meet the accuracy requirements for the tested \nECT. Test results are shown in Fig .13 (transformer type: ECT; test channel: A phase; rated \ntransformation ratio  of measuring current: 300A/1A; test  times: 10; transformer inherent \ndelay: 188μs). \nAs shown in Figs.13  and 14,   the percentage  ratio error and phase error of the  tested 0.2  \nclass EVT/ECT are small and lower than the 0.2s class limit.

Conclusions \n \nIn this paper, an on-site calibration system for electronic voltage and current transformers \nwith both a nalog and digital outputs has been introduced. The signals are measured at the \nsecondary outputs of the reference transformer and tested transformer when the same \nexcitation signal is fed to their primaries. To improve the measurement accuracy, the \nHWIpFFT algorithm is used. Labview is used as the unified software platform for computing, \nsaving, calling and displaying, which provides a convenient way for the proposed calibration \nsystem. In accordance with IEC60044 -7/8, the system can verify  the ratio error and phase \nerror of the tested EVT/ECT.   \nThe type test results mentioned above show that the proposed system has a high accuracy \nqualified to the calibration of the tested EVT/ECT. The on -site calibration proves that it is \nalso convenient in the on -site installation and implement ation. The experiment results show \nthat it can meet the calibration requirements of the electronic instrument transformer with 0.2s \nclass. So, the system is suitable for on -site testing due to its high accuracy, simple structure \nand low-cost hardware. \n \n \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of  China grants 51077058 and \n51277080. \n \n M.
