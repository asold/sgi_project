  "abstract": "Retrieving health information is a task of search for health-related information from a variety of sources. Gathering self-reported health information may help enrich the knowledge body of the disease and its symptoms. We investigated retrieving symptom mentions in COVID-19-related Twitter posts with a pretrained large language model (GPT-3) without providing any examples (zero-shot learning). We introduced a new performance measure of total match (TM) to include exact, partial and semantic matches. Our results show that the zero-shot approach is a powerful method without the need to annotate any data, and it can assist in generating instances for few-shot learning which may achieve better performance.",
