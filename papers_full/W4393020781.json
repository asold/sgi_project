  "abstract": "Background While large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard have shown significant promise in various fields, their broader impact on enhancing patient health care access and quality, particularly in specialized domains such as oral health, requires comprehensive evaluation. Objective This study aims to assess the effectiveness of Google Bard, ChatGPT-3.5, and ChatGPT-4 in offering recommendations for common oral health issues, benchmarked against responses from human dental experts. Methods This comparative analysis used 40 questions derived from patient surveys on prevalent oral diseases, which were executed in a simulated clinical environment. Responses, obtained from both human experts and LLMs, were subject to a blinded evaluation process by experienced dentists and lay users, focusing on readability, appropriateness, harmlessness, comprehensiveness, intent capture, and helpfulness. Additionally, the stability of artificial intelligence responses was also assessed by submitting each question 3 times under consistent conditions. Results Google Bard excelled in readability but lagged in appropriateness when compared to human experts (mean 8.51, SD 0.37 vs mean 9.60, SD 0.33; P=.03). ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, however, performed comparably with human experts in terms of appropriateness (mean 8.96, SD 0.35 and mean 9.34, SD 0.47, respectively), with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating the highest stability and reliability. Furthermore, all 3 LLMs received superior harmlessness scores comparable to human experts, with lay users finding minimal differences in helpfulness and intent capture between the artificial intelligence models and human responses. Conclusions LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-4, show potential in oral health care, providing patient-centric information for enhancing patient education and clinical care. The observed performance variations underscore the need for ongoing refinement and ethical considerations in health care settings. Future research focuses on developing strategies for the safe integration of LLMs in health care settings.",
