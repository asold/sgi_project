Foundations: Asimov’s Foundation Series and AI’s Foundation Models \n \nUnlike Hari Seldon, we cannot predict the future. On planet Earth in the twenty-first century, simply interrogating the present \ncan be a complex undertaking. Hari is a mathematician and our first protagonist in Asimov’s Foundation series.1 Having \npioneered the field of ‘psychohistory’, which resembles sociology on steroids in its quantification and prediction of the sum of \nhuman behaviour, Hari believes that he can not only foretell future events but can also intervene and mitigate the impending \ncollapse of the Galactic Empire. And yet, we can find echoes of similar approaches throughout the twentieth and twenty-first \ncenturies, in both fact and fiction. Insights from Hari’s work can offer us three core themes for exploring the implications for \nsociety of f uture technologies and how we might regulate them —specifically, natural language processing (NLP) artificial \nintelligence (AI). In a tale of life imitating art, these themes characterise the trajectory of both law and economics in the  \ntwentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and now comprise the analytical and normative backdrop against which we seek to \nregulate NLP AI. \n \nFiction is not anathema to critical explorations in the social sciences. 2 Economists frequently start out with the proposition \n‘Imagine…’, usually following this entreaty with a simplified, fictionalised account of real -world interactions.3 Lawyers are \nsimilarly prone to asking ‘what if?’ and to using hypothetical situations to explore the limits of legal doctrine. 4 In querying \n \n1 Asimov, Foundation. \n2 Vaihinger’s ‘as if’, or ‘fiction’ theory is noteworthy here. See inter alia Kelsen, “On the Theory of Juridic Fictions”; Samuel, “The \nEpistemological Challenge.” \n3 See, for example, Coase, “The Problem of Social Cost.” We might note that the concept of the  free, self-regulating market is little more \nthan a utopian fiction. See, for example, Polanyi, The Great Transformation. \n4 Western legality is founded on a series of fictions, from the legal person to John Locke’s mental gymnastics creating terra nullius that \njustified settler-colonialism, land expropriation and extraction. Even legal interpretation by courts of contracts relies on questions of what the \nparties might have intended, blurring the line between fact and fiction. Kramer, “Common Sense Principles of Contract Interpretation.” \nAre we at risk of preserving in digital aspic current hegemonic ways of doing, talking and thinking about law and \neconomy? Our dominant frames are those of neoclassical economics and doctrinal law, which, combined, align with \nneoliberal assumptions and preferences. Invisible through their ubiquity, these partially reveal and conceal problems \nand solutions, perpetuating inequalities. And yet, unlike social biases, our framing tends to fly largely under the \nradar, as we see in Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series. \nTaking three themes from Asimov’s work that align with current hegemonic frames, namely the centrality of the \nindividual as the subject, a belief in scientism and technological progress to save humanity, and a dissatisfaction with \nthe limitations of language, this paper explores what, how and why we might exercise caution in the development of \nnatural language processing (NLP) artificial intelligence (AI). By drawing parallels with Asimov’s work and the \ndevelopment of foundation models that underpin all NLP AI systems, this paper asks to what extent neoliberal \nframing and the inequalities perpetuated therein might come to be embedded in future technologies. \n \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 110  \n \nfuture imaginaries, especially in regard to future technologies, we are already in the realm of science fiction.5 Unlike law and \neconomics, which are (or at least should be) drawn back to their real -world applications, science fiction offers a realm from \nwhich there is no imperative to return to reality. By staying with the unreal, with the speculative, we can explore future demands \nthat might be made of both law and economics through cultural lenses.6 We can ask what kind of society we might want, what \nperils this society might face from emerging technologies, and how these might be averted, modified, or tempered. This might, \nin turn, extend to the conceptualisation of law, the prevalence of the social or cultural, and the perceived relations between the \nlaw, the economy and society. An exploration of law and technology literature already notes that such endeavours c an be \nintrinsically limited by how the inquiry is framed, noting the tendency towards doctrinal, positivistic scholarship—a hegemonic \napproach that elides the normative.7 What tends to be lacking, to date, in both the law and technology and AI literatures  is a \ndeep dive into the importance of framing—that is, the vocabularies and grammars that we use to understand and perform legal \nand economic phenomena, and how these, in turn, perform us. \n \nThe problem, though, as we can see from even a cursory reading of Asimov’s Foundation series, is that to be able to interrogate \nand imagine alternatives, we need an awareness that things can change. We need a starting point that acknowledges the \ntemporal, spatial and cultural contingencies of both law and economics; that our ways of regulating behaviour and allocating \nresources are not immutable facts of nature but can, do and indeed ought to change. \n \nAs a thought experiment, consider the differences between our notions of law and economy and those of the Roman Empire \nsome 2,500 years ago. While there are some parallels —many of our legal concepts evolved from origins in Roman law —\ncenturies of evolution, along with some revolutions in legal and economic thought, mean that these contemporary social \ninstitutions now look quite different to their Roman counterparts, despite a modest time difference of some 2,500 years. 8 By \ncontrast, Asimov’s Galactic Empire is set tens of thousands of years hence, and billions of miles away. We might, then, expect \nthe legal and economic institutions described and performed by characters in the Foundation series to have evolved drastically \nfrom their earthbound origins. Yet, they are curiously unchanged from their manifestations in the 1940s United States: \ncharacters refer to legal treaties, rights to land ownership and resource extraction, and describe commercial transactions. This \ncopy-and-paste of the social structures so central to the book can be familiar and yet jarring, given the radical scientific and \ntechnological innovations against wh ich they are counterposed. 9 Could this have been a deliberate ploy on the part of the \nauthor? Or was the wholesale import of legal and economic conceptual and linguistic tools simply an ‘unthought known’, those \ndeep rationalities we are so frequently unaware of?10 Were ways of doing, talking and thinking about law and economy simply \nso obvious, so ubiquitous and so unchangeable to Asimov because no other way of framing these things had ever been put to \nhim?11 \n \nOne answer might be that Asimov imported the s ocial institutions of the twentieth -century United States into the  Galactic \nEmpire to interrogate them against an unfamiliar backdrop. A fictionalised examination allows ‘for a cultural response, \nconsideration, and critique of events before they occur’, allowing Asimov to interrogate possible future technologies and their \nimpacts on United States society.12 However valuable this approach might have proven, we are potentially at risk of making \nthe same mistakes in the context of AI by failing to interrogate our ‘unthought knowns’.13 In interrogating the risks and rewards \nfor humanity of AI, our task is similar to Seldon’s in predicting and mitigating harm. The development of NLP AI, which \ndepends on a small number of foundation models, is transforming virtually all walks of life, from healthcare, to education, to \nlaw. Foundation models, as monolithic entities that are expensive to devise and train, are relatively few but underpin almost all \nNLP AI systems. If you are talking to a chatbot about your television insurance or a health complaint, or using a legal algorithm \nto draft a contract, you are, most likely, using an adapted and applied foundation model. Google searches: foundation model.14 \nSiri or Alexa: foundation model. The list goes on. The point is that we tend to use these tools every day without realising. These \nmodels are trained using existing data that were originally created by (a subset of) humans —flawed, biased humans with \n \n5 Tranter, “The Speculative Jurisdiction.” \n6 Travis, “Making Space.” \n7 Tranter, “The Laws of  Technology”; Tranter, “The Law and Technology Enterprise”; Tranter, “The Speculative Jurisdiction”; Travis, \n“Making Space.” \n8 Samuel, “Classification of Obligations and the Impact of Constructivist Epistemologies”; Samuel, “Have There Been Scientific Revolutions \nin Law?”; Samuel, Rethinking Legal Reasoning; Samuel, “Causation and Casuistic Reasoning in Roman and Later Civil Law.” \n9 Asimov does not spend much time on character or plot development in the books. Nevertheless, the books comprise core science fiction \ncanon. \n10 Bernstein, “There is No Local Here, Love”; Frerichs, “Re-embedding Neoliberal Constitutionalism.” \n11 Harraway, Staying with the Trouble; Norman, Posthuman Legal Subjectivity. \n12 Travis, “Making Space: Law and Science Fiction,” 248. \n13 Bernstein, “There is No Local Here, Love.” \n14 Uszkoreit, “Transformer”; Nayak, “Understanding Searches.” \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 111  \n \npreferences and assumptions. And these biases are not only preserved but ca n also be amplified over future generations of \nfoundation models.15 \n \nFoundation model de -biasing initiatives are becoming increasingly sophisticated in identifying and fixing biases found in \nfoundation models and their downstream adaptations, as later sections discuss in more detail. But the more nuanced, subtler \nframing of  legal and economic phenomena that can encode preferences and perform inequalities is still passing, largely, \nunnoticed. We are, then, potentially embedding hegemonic notions of law and economy into our future AI systems. And in \ndoing so, we are potentiall y placing these mainstream conceptual and linguistic tools further beyond the reach of current or \nfuture interrogation, and beyond the reach of natural linguistic evolution. But the way we talk matters. Like a torch shining  \nacross a topographical landscape, the frames we deploy both reveal and conceal by highlighting some voices and interests while \ncasting others into deep shadow. And yet they tend to be those taken -for-granted parts of speech that fly largely under the \nconscious radar. While technological progress has innumerable benefits to offer humanity, by preserving hegemonic framing, \nwe risk preserving in digital aspic preferences for those values and interests that are highlighted by that frame. And these tend \nto be those that align with dominant frames: neoclassical economics and doctrinal approaches to law. \n \n1.1 Three Themes \nPerhaps—subplot twist—Asimov foretold the rise of NLP AI systems and the foundation models that underpin them. Perhaps \nhe meant to transplant directly the legal and economic institutions familiar to us today in the global north and the (neo-)liberal \nsocial context in which they emerged. Perhaps Asimov intended to warn us about the dangers of en coding social institutions \nand transposing them from one social context to another without a second thought, bound up as they are in our metaphors and \nlinguistic fictions. However unlikely this may be, the Foundation series gives us three sub-themes that align with hegemonic \nframing of law and economy to explore the potential pitfalls, and opportunities, of AI systems. Through these, we can also \nexplore how we might be preserving the conceptual and linguistic tools of neoliberalism (neoclassical economics and doctrinal \nor positivist law) in future foundation models. \n \nIn turning first to individualism, a core tenet of both neoclassical economic theory and doctrinal legal scholarship, the pap er \nwill suggest that Asimov’s atomistic and individualistic characters like Hari Seldon and his fellow scientists are simply homines \neconomici and homines juridici.16 They are, and act as, the social atoms that comprise the focus of mainstream approaches in \nthe social sciences. Using insights from performativity and the cog nitive sciences, we can see how these caricatured models \nthat have developed in both economics and the law have a performative effect on their subjects. Over time, we come to perform \nas the model, much as the inhabitants of Asimov’s  First Galactic Empire d o, and this assumption underpins many of the \nconceptual and linguistic tools on which foundation models are trained. \n \nThen, second, focusing on belief in technological progress and scientism to save humanity, the following section sets out how \na reliance on quantification in the social sciences (exemplified by the Law and Economics movement and seen in the World \nBank’s Doing Business series) attempted to realise just such a move. While characters in the Foundation series engage in \n‘symbolic logic’ to boil down textual treaties to mere symbols, we can see parallels in the quantification, mathematisation and \ncomparison of the law and of society, as well as in the encoding of language in models for the development of NLP. 17 These \ncorrespond, respectively, to th e empirical, analytical and normative tools of neoclassical economics and have been widely \napplied to virtually every area of social life.18 Being preserved, unwittingly, in future NLP foundation models raises questions \nabout the encoding and amplification of bias and resulting inequality.19 \n \nThird, the paper turns to Asimov’s (spoken through Hardin) dissatisfaction with the rhetoric and obfus cation of language.20 \nHuman thought processes are largely metaphorical, and our ways of talking about law and economy are no different. But baked \n \n15 Bommasani, “On the Opportunities.” \n16 Latin plurals of the more familiar homo economicus and homo juridicus are borrowed from MacKenzie, “Constructing a Market,” 139. \n17 The European Commission has suggested that ‘[c]ombining symbolic reasoning with deep neural networks may help us improve \nexplainability of AI outcomes’ and defines ‘symbolic approaches’ as those rules created through human i ntervention. See European \nCommission, White Paper, 5. \n18 Perry-Kessaris, “Prepare Your Indicators.” \n19 The OECD Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence advocates for the preservation of ‘economic incentives’ for  \ninnovation within AI, while recommending that AI development is based on key principles such as ‘inclusive growth’ and ‘human-centred \nvalues and fairness’. See OECD “Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence.” \n20 See Hardin’s comments in Foundation as well as his descrip tion of Holk’s ‘symbolic logic’ analysis that ‘succeeded in eliminating \nmeaningless statements, vague gibberish, useless qualification – in short, all the goo and dribble’, which resulted in finding that ‘he had \nnothing left. Everything cancelled out’. We can see Asimov’s distaste for, and distrust of, verbiage and loquacity and his preference for the \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 112  \n \ninto our metaphors are assumptions, preferences and biases about law, economy and society that we frequently l ose sight of, \ndespite the conceptual heavy lifting we ask them to perform. As future foundation models are trained on our metaphors, no \namount of contextual understanding can compensate for overlooking the importance of framing and the inequalities that might \nresult. Given that the political right has, for decades, been setting the frames, this seems a curious point in history to de velop \nAI systems that might preserve in digital aspic our hegemonic neoliberal conceptual and linguistic tools and the voices a nd \nvalues they privilege. Perhaps forever. \n \nThe final section provocatively asks at what point Asimov’s Zeroth Law of robotics might come into play if AI systems were \npermitted to entrench inequalities through legal and economic frames. Before turning to t hese three themes though, a word \nabout metaphors is useful. But before that, a short introduction to foundation models is instructive. \n \n2. Foundation Models, Natural Language and Artificial Intelligence \n \nFoundation models require huge investments of time and money. They are the results of complex training involving ‘self -\nsupervised learning’ on the part of the algorithm.21 So, for example, to train one foundation model (with the friendly name of \nBERT), a ‘masked language modelling task’ is used, where the algorithm is asked to fill in the blank, using only the surrounding \ncontext for guidance.22 An example is ‘I like _____ sprouts’. As humans, we might note that the most obvious word here is \n‘eating’. But we might also be able to think of dozens of other verbs conveying what we might like to do with a sprout. The \npoint is that we use the surrounding words as context to deduce the most likely word. Tasks like this are more scalable as they \nrely on unlabelled data and, as they force the model to predict parts of the inputs, they result in models that are potentially richer \nand more useful.23 \n \nFoundation models are intermediary assets rather than end products; they require adaptation and application to realise real -\nworld impact. Nevertheless, their value comes from their ‘emergent qualities’, or skills that these foundation models can \ndevelop on their own without prompts or comma nds from a human. This derives from the ‘self -supervised’ learning that \nfoundation models undertake, which grew out of work on ‘word embeddings’, which ‘associated each word with a context -\nindependent vector’ and provided the basis for a wide range of NLP models. Context was then added through the \n‘autoregressive’ approach (e.g., predict the next word given the previous words), and this produced models that represented \nwords in context. The next wave in self -supervised learning built on the Transformer arch itecture (the ‘T’ in BERT), which \nincorporated ‘more powerful deep bidirectional encoders of sentences’ that again allowed for scaling up to larger models and \ndatasets. Accordingly, the BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, T5 and BART models followed. \n \nThe ‘sociological inflection’ at this point, and the realisation that a small number of foundation models could be adapted and \napplied to an infinite variety of tasks, led to the era of the foundation model.24 Now, ‘[a]lmost all state-of-the-art NLP models \nare […] adapted f rom one of a few foundation models’ such as BERT. 25 This has benefits: homogenisation means that the \ncostly and time-consuming training required to get BERT up to a certain standard can be applied to a wide range of downstream \nscenarios and contexts. But, conversely, ‘all AI systems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation \nmodels’.26 Like an echo in a cave that repeats countless times as it bounces off the cave walls, foundation models have the \npotential to echo throughout the applications to which they are adapted, repeating and re-entrenching intrinsic biases to an ever-\nincreasing range of contexts. Two problems arise. \n \nFirst, the next generation of foundation models will likely be trained on data curated from interactions with the cur rent \ngeneration, which already encodes bias. The echo chamber of foundation model homogenisation, then, could easily see not \nonly the preservation but also the augmentation of intrinsic bias over generations of foundation models. Second, foundation \nmodels are too complex and too monolithic to be adjustable following their release, despite the acknowledgement that ‘any \n \nclear, neat, precision of numerical values that finds echo in the quantified preferences and binaries of neoclassical economi cs. Asimov, \nFoundation, 64, 67. \n21 Bommasani, “On the Opportunities,” 4. The term ‘foundation’ also connotes ‘the significance of architectural stability, safety, and security: \npoorly-constructed foundations are a recipe for disaster and well -executed foundations are a reliable bedrock for  future applications’: \nBommasani, “On the Opportunities,” 7. \n22 BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is deeply bidirectional, making it able to draw on context to determine \ntask response. Devlin, “Open-Sourcing BERT”; Devlin, “BERT.” \n23 Bommasani, “On the Opportunities,” 4. \n24 Bommasani, “On the Opportunities.” \n25 Bommasani, “On the Opportunities,” 5. \n26 Bommasani, “On the Opportunities,” 5. \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 113  \n \nflaws in the [foundation] model [will be] blindly inherited by all adapted models’.27 Therefore, social or representational biases \ndiscovered must be remedied post hoc and, accordingly, a de-biasing industry has sprung up, concerned both with identifying \nbiases and then devising the best ways of prompting foundation models to engage in self-supervised remedial study.28 Explicit \nsocial bias can be identified easily. But more commonly, bias is concealed in layers of metaphor and implication, meaning that \nwhile each of the words might be uncontroversial, when put together in a certain context, their combined meaning can produce \ninequalities. If, for example, the model tends to assume that doctors are male and nurses are female, we can appreciate a subtle \nbias, despite all the individual words being unproblematic. Nevertheless, our growing reliance on AI is a grand social \nexperiment that is being con ducted on a largely unsuspecting public in real time, without Hari’s psychohistorical tools to \ncalculate and predict future benefits and harms. \n \n3. Language, Meaning and Metaphor \n \nAs a uniquely complex phenomenon, language, rhetoric, or ‘sweet talk’ is at once a cognitive and cultural system of encoded \npreferences and assumptions.29 This holds as much for small talk as for social institutions like law and economy. And yet \nlanguage is more than a system of signs and sounds. 30 Thus, what it means ‘to mean’ or  ‘to understand’ has long troubled \nphilosophers, sociologists, linguists and now computer programmers working in AI.31 Foundation models can not only process \nbut also recreate original text that can pass, for the most part, for human -created content.32 But to ask whether a foundation \nmodel ‘understands’ what it has just written inquires into the temporal, spatial, cultural and contextual contingencies of \nlanguage, as well as the subjective interpretation of symbols and sounds. While foundation models proces s words in context, \nthey lack an awareness of the language’s subtext, of social context and of the full pragmatic impact of those words. Foundation \nmodels remain amoral, acontextual and unaware of the meaning that lies within the (very convincing) texts they can generate.33 \nThus, while for humans, language is a key to unlock communication, for foundation models, language is a mathematical process \nthat can unlock engagement with humans. \n \nHari and some of Asimov’s other characters are unimpressed with the vagaries of language, engaging in a process called \n‘symbolic logic’ to boil down the text of legal treaties to their core assertions. They find, to their collective horror, that a treaty \nin fact stated the opposite of their assumptions.34 We might note parallels here with NLP AI in the way that language modellers \nquantify linguistic tokens, breaking down language into constituent parts that can then be processed by an algorithm, as seen  \nin Figures 1 and 2. These illustrate how we might quantify language and how we might represent these data visually. As section \n5 discusses, the quantification of language and the human interactions it facilitates reflects a twentieth -century belief in the \npotential of mathematics to encode all social phenomena. \n \n \nFigure 1.

Screengrab from Sap, “Social Bias Frames,” 5482, showing how we might quantify language, and how this \nmight be processed by an algorithm. There are parallels with Asimov’s concept of ‘symbolic logic’ in the Foundation \nseries. \n \n \n \nHowever, problems can arise when we lose sight of the language we are quantifying and how our metaphors construct our \nsocial worlds. Metaphor is one of the key ways in which we not only add colour and vivacity to our language, making it more \nmemorable and visual, but with which we can also mask or shade intent. Our ‘ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which \nwe both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature’, from the ‘most mundane details’ through to the concepts that \n‘structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people’.35 Metaphor is not merely an \n‘optional, rhetorical flourish’ but our ‘most pervasive means of ordering our experience into conceptual systems’, and our ways \nof talking about the law and the economy are no different.36 Metaphors, then, are those linguistic tropes to which we default \nwhen speaking about social phenomena—for law and economy are just that.37 We might think of them as collections of social \nbehaviour that we lump together for linguistic convenience. Neither exists as a tangible entity but can be observed in how we \ndo, talk and think. For example, if I ask you to point to ‘the law’, you might point to a courtroom, a judge, or a statute. W hat \nyou are pointing to is, respectively, a building, a person and a piece of paper. Similarly, if I ask you to point to ‘the economy’, \n \n35 Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By, 3. \n36 Bandes, “Empathy,” 361; Levit, “Legal Storytelling”; Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By, 25; Geary, I is an Other. \n37 Hari deploys metaphor without a second thought, referring at his trial to the destruction of the ‘fabric of society’. Asimov, Foundation, 30. \nOn metaphor as a trope or, more accurately, a class inclusion statement, see Ortony, Metaphor and Thought. \n\nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 115  \n \nyou might point to a bank, some coins, or even cryptocurrency. But, again, you are pointing to a building, some small pieces \nof metal and digitally encoded data. And, yet, undeniably, a common meaning is communicated: we understand references to \ncollections of social behaviours that we can identify in terms of their use, abuse and avoidance.38 In line with George Lakoff’s \nobservation then, we might note that ‘t he law’ and ‘the economy’ are ‘ontological metaphors’; non -entities that we refer to \nevery day, generally without further consideration.39 \n \nBut we build on this linguistically. We say that the ‘law has made an ass of us all’, or that ‘the economy has taken a nosedive’. \nIn personifying these primary ontological metaphors, we can identify a second layer of metaphor that sits atop the first, adding \ncolour and vivacity. We can then note a third layer of metaphor that discusses the relationship of two ontological metaphors to \neach other; for example, that ‘the law is embedded in society’, or ‘the economy must be re -embedded in society’. Here, \nembeddedness operates as a tertiary level ontological metaphor, visually describing the relationship between two primary, \nontological metaphors. The embeddedness metaphor, then, implies that, in the first example, the law and society (yet another \nontological metaphor) coexist in space and time. In the second example, we understand that the economy should be brought \nback to coexist in space and time with society. \n \nAnd yet, peering through the layers of metaphor, we can appreciate that describing the relationship of two non-entities to each \nother is disingenuous. If both law and economy are social phenomena, coming into existence only when performed in an \ninteraction (synchronous or asynchronous), it is nonsense to speak of one being ‘embedded’ within the other. Neither the law \nor the economy can exist without society. But our layers of metaphor can mask this, and herein lies the problem. When our \nlinguistic and conceptual tools for law and economy are conceptually inconsistent (describing socially constructed phenomena \nas ontologically distinct entities), two things occur. First, embeddedness talk maintains the metaphorical fiction of the \nontologically separate law, economy and society. Second, it further entrenches the hegemonic approaches within each sphere—\ndoctrinal law and neoclassical economics, respectively. Our throwaway metaphor, then, not only masks the socially constructed \nnature of legal and economic phenome na, but elides more imaginative, sociological responses that we might explore to the \ncrashes, crises and catastrophes that we are currently facing. To be clear, this is the result of the disconnect between our \nlinguistic tools (metaphorically saying that the law is embedded in society) and what we do in practice (socially constructing \nthe law through interactions). The problems arise when we lose sight of our metaphors, the concepts baked into them and the \nheavy lifting we are asking these concepts to do. T hen, having foreclosed sociological responses to crashes, crises and \ncatastrophes through incompatible conceptual and linguistic tools, we are left with no other option than to repeat the concepts \nthat led us into those dilemmas in the first place. \n \nBut there is more: metaphors can operate generatively, as self -fulfilling prophecies, shaping not only our worlds but also \nourselves. Coupled with insights from linguistics, psychology and sociology, this might give us cause to sit up and take note  \nabout the eme rgence of self -supervised learning in AI or the development of foundation models. 40 In 2006, researchers \ninvestigating attitudes to animal welfare across Europe made a mistake. 41 In some of the telephone interviews, respondents \nwere referred to as citizens. In other interviews, respondents were referred to as consumers. The survey did not set out to test \nthe performativity of respondent labelling, but when the data were analysed and all other variables were controlled, analysts  \nfound that those respondents who had been identified as citizens had a preference for government to regulate animal welfare. \nIn contrast, respondents identified as consumers tended to show a preference for more market -based interventions such as \nproduct labelling and price. While more research is needed, insights from the cognitive sciences indicate that how we talk about \nsocial institutions can affect our self-perception and social positionality.42 These insights indicate that switching up the framing \ncan indeed have significant impacts on associated phenomena: how we perceive and perform them. \n \nThis is particularly relevant for law and economics as they have their own caricatures that embody how mainstream legal and \neconomic theories understand the world. Homo juridicus, the reasonable man of law who contracts to realise his interests, is \nreproduced in mainstream legal language of property, contract and rights-based discourse. Homo economicus, the rational man \nof economics, contracts efficiently to maximise his utility, and we can note the language of ‘productivity’, ‘efficiency’, ‘value’ \nand ‘exchange’ as common terms that encode this caricature; terms that have seeped into wider discourse and shaped broader \nsocial narratives.43 For if we only have the language of homo economicus-juridicus, we can only talk like homo economicus-\njuridicus, think like homo economicus-juridicus and act like homo economicus-juridicus. Asimov’s cast of characters in the \n \n38 Perry, “Use, Abuse and Avoidance.” Accordingly, we can identify the performance of ‘law’ as much through avoidance of the formal legal \nsystem as engagement with it. \n39 Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By. \n40 Schön, “Generative Metaphor.” \n41 Eurobarometer, Special EB; Law, “Seeing Like a Survey.” \n42 MacKenzie, “Constructing a Market”; Callon, “What Does it Mean”; MacKenzie, Do Economists Make Markets? \n43 We can think of Giddens’ ‘double hermeneutic’ here. Giddens, The Constitution of Society. \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 116  \n \nFoundation series exemplify this, trading in property rights and land ownership for extraction, discussing the economic value \nof a planet and the productivity of its workforce, and relying on legalistic treaties that encode post -Westphalian notions of \nsovereignty and statehood that have little relevance to the Galactic Empire. These characters cannot escape the mental models \nof their forebears, despite being in completely different time, space and cultural settings. But, like us, they are for the most part \nunaware of the ways in which their vocabularies and grammars, bound up in layers of metap hor, mould their social \n(inter)actions. \n \nIt would seem odd, then, to think that training an algorithm to reproduce our current ways of doing, talking and thinking could \nbe anything but as deeply flawed as our current day-to-day conceptual and linguistic tools. And yet, that is precisely what we \nare doing. The following three sections take three sub-themes from Asimov’s Foundation series to interrogate potential pitfalls \nof preserving our current frames in foundation models. \n \n4. Framing Foundation Models (1): The Atomistic Individual \n \nAsimov was not writing about a future society but about a collection of individuals who live in the future, some thousands of \nmillennia hence. This is no coincidence. The individual actor is central to neoclassical economics and doctrinal law, and, as the \nhegemonic frames of the 1940s United States, these were transposed directly into Asimov’s Galactic Empire. The result is a \nfocus on individual accountability and the justification of any attempt to maximise individual utility. Homo economicus, in \nmainstream economics, and his lawyerly cousin homo juridicus, embody the bundle of features and desires typically assumed \nby each discipline in their calculations about human society. Neither are particularly moral souls, nor are they socially \nnetworked. The focus sits squarely on the individual actor or agent, although this is gradually being challenged by post -\nindividualist scholarship.44 \n \nOur current conceptual and linguistic tools, much as those deployed by Hardin and his co-protagonists in the Foundation series, \nassume the rational individual agent, and assume that he—for he is invariably a he—is solely responsible for maximising his \nown utility. Asimov’s storytelling sets the perfect fictionalised render of an atomistic social conglomeration. We are not \nenlightened about the relationships between characters. Nor are we told much about their emotional or mental states. The \ncharacters are, for the most part, singular automata that deliver their set lines to the page and go about constructing the narrative. \nNeoclassical economics paints a similar picture of society, although more recent insights from behavioural economics and \npsychology have called out homo economicus for the ‘rational fool’ he was 45 and still is. For ‘he’ still exerts a surprising \ninfluence over how we do, talk and think about law and economy, and how they, in turn, think about us. \n \nWe might ask, then, if our assumptions about the atomistic individual, with their fixed preferences and perfect information, \nwho generally disregards the wishes of other s and the wider moral context in which he acts, should be preserved in future \nfoundation models. What might we lose sight of in the process? Might this leave us with conceptual and linguistic tools that \nde-prioritise notions of community, networks and interactions? \n \n5. Framing Foundation Models (2): Progress and Scientism \n \nWe see, through Hari Seldon’s eyes, that the First Galactic Empire is dying, collapsing under the weight of a bloated and \noverbearing bureaucracy on the ruling planet of Trantor. Nevertheles s, there is hope that the impending Dark Ages can be \nshortened.46 Seldon gives an account of his psychohistorical analysis that not only calculates the present but also predicts the \nfuture. The quantification, mathematisation and comparison of social phenomena reflect the empirical, analytical and normative \ntools, respectively, of neoclassical economics.47 Asimov might have been writing science fiction, and might even have believed \nin the possibility of quantifying the social realm, but the late twentieth and early twenty -first centuries saw this happen.48 A \n \n44 See vulnerability theory, work on the Anthropocene, and sociological approaches such as economic sociology of law, relational work and \nactor–network theory. \n45 Thaler, “From Homo Economicus to Homo Sapiens”; Thaler, Nudge; Thaler, Misbehaving. Far from being a panacea, behavioural \neconomics is the subject of significant scholarly challenge. See Frerichs, “Putting Behavioural Economics in its Place”; Hockley, “Do Nudges \nWork?” \n46 Through Hari Seldon’s psychohistorical analysis of the downfall of the Galactic Empire due to its bureaucracy, we glimpse Asi mov’s \ndistaste for big state. Technological innovation is counterposed with statehood and bureaucracy, echoing Hayekian economics. Reading back \nthrough a Polanyian lens by contrast, we can appreciate the fictional account of Hayek’s self-regulating market economy. See Polanyi, The \nGreat Transformation. \n47 See Perry-Kessaris, “Recycle, Reduce and Reflect”; Perry-Kessaris, “Prepare Your Indicators.” \n48 The apocryphal apogee here is probably Gary Becker’s economic analysis of children, but Daren Acemoglu’s use of proxy indicators (death \nrates to infer quality of institutions) runs a close second. Nevertheless, the ‘LLSV’ literature, in setting an agenda for the quantification of \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 117  \n \ngood example is the field of Law and Development, which saw the application of neoclassical economics theories and methods \nto the law, instrumentally designing legal reforms and interventions to realise economic goals.49 This appropriation of the tools \nof neoclassical economics continued a trend in the t wentieth century of ‘physics envy’ throughout the social sciences. 50 \nEconomics aped the methods of the natural sciences, and law, in turn, aped economics. In seeking out quantifiable \nmethodologies and eschewing the uncertainties and grey areas so central t o the messy realities of social life, law sought the \nsame reverence and respect accorded to the natural sciences and, latterly, economics.51 \n \nOne result was the World Bank’s Doing Business indicators, which quantified aspects of the legal system of each country, \nassigning them a ranking that indicated how desirable to foreign investors each system was. But, as with all indicators, once  \nyou create the ‘law reform Olympics’ and start keeping score, everybody wants to win.52 Countries engaged in legal reform for \nno more reason than jumping in the World Bank rankings, in effect transforming those indicators from mere measurements into \n‘technologies of governance’.53 The fact that local communities on the ground might be disadvantaged in the process, or that \nno one had asked foreign investors what they really wanted, was beside the point. It seemed intuitive that a strong rule of law \nwould enable economic development. \n \nThe Doing Business debacle of 2019, in which the whole programme came crashing down amid accusations of bullying, \ncorruption and data manipulation, caused the World Bank to terminate the programme in 2021.54 Nevertheless, a belief in the \npower of quantification, and of indicators to inform, enlighten and regulate, underpins the World Bank’s new Business Enabling \nEnvironment, which replaces the Doing Business series and will once again rank countries according to the features of their \nlegal systems.55 Indicators are just as rhetorical as words. And yet, having the appearance of objectivity and scientism, the \nanalytical and normative undercurrents tend to be pushed further beyond sight and interrogation. Sometimes, though, having a \nclear answer can be more important than being right.56 Neat, simplified, quantifiable answers can be as preferable for time-poor \npolicymakers on planet Earth as they are for the Board on the planet of Terminus, as we see reflected in the Board’s engagement \nin symbolic logic to reduce down legal treaties to their core principles. \n \nAsimov’s belief in the potential of scientific and technological progress to save humanity —ostensibly from itself—reflects a \nhegemonic viewpoint that persists in society some 80 years after the publication of the Foundation series.57 Technological \nprogress must undoubtedly play a part in our responses to the crashes, crises and catastrophes facing humanity. But social and \nbehavioural shifts are also necessary, and to imagine and accomplish these, we need new ways of doing, talking and thinking \nabout those ubiquitous social institutions that Asimov overlooked in his Foundation series. For example, thinking of the \nenvironmental catastrophe of climate change, we can appreciate that our conceptual and linguistic tools, in reproducing social \npatterns of behaviour that recreate homo economicus-juridicus, recreate the conditions that led us into the climate crisis in the \nfirst place.58 Homo economicus-juridicus cares little for the fate of the planet —he simply does not have the conceptual or \nlinguistic tools to imagine acting otherwise. And yet, these conceptual and linguistic tools comprise the data on which we are \ntraining future AI systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlegal analysis, had an undeniably profound impact on legal scholarship. See Acemoglu, Institutions as the Fundamental Cause of Long-Run \nGrowth; La Porta, “Legal Determinants of External Finance”; La Porta, “The Quality of Government”; La Porta, “The Economic \nConsequences of Legal Origins”; Becker, “An Economic Analysis of Fertility.” \n49 Perry-Kessaris, “Prepare Your Indicators.” \n50 Mirowski, “Do Economists Suffer from Physics Envy?” \n51 Barber, “Absolutization of the Market”; Hirsch, “Clean Models vs. Dirty Hands.” \n52 World Bank, Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy; World Bank, Rule of Law and Development; Taylor, “The Law Reform \nOlympics.” \n53 Davis, Indicators as a Technology of Global Governance. \n54 Machen, Investigation of Data Irregularities. \n55 See https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/business-enabling-environment. \n56 Hirsch, “Clean Models vs. Dirty Hands.” See Part 2 of Asimov’s Foundation series. Curiously, the notion of a treaty with Trantor invokes \nnotions of post-Westphalian state sovereignty that is clearly anathema to Asimov’s Galactic Empire. \n57 Asimov appears to be working with a linear concept of time, with progress moving in only one direction: a Fukuyama-esque reading of the \nhuman condition. John Gray, by contrast, urges us to think of human history as cyclical, ebbing and flowing. See Gray, Heresies; Fukuyama, \nThe End of History. \n58 MacKenzie and Millo suggestively propose imagining their socially situated, morally networked cousin, homo sociologicus, who is freed \nfrom the assumptions, preferences and constraints of mainstream economics and law. MacKenzie, “Constructing a Market,” 141. \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 118  \n \n6. Framing Foundation Models (3): Natural Language and Its Limitations \n \nIf I ask you not to think of an elephant, you will, inevitably, think of an elephant.59 This is entirely natural and unavoidable; it \nis simply how the human brain works. But there are profound implications here for how we talk and think about law and \neconomy. As Lakoff and Johnson note, ‘[t]he people who get to impose their metaphors on the culture get to define what we \nconsider to be true’. 60 This extends to legal and economic phenomena, as the discussion above set out with reference to \nembeddedness talk. So, then, is the economy embedded in society? Or has society become embedded in the eco nomy? What \nabout the law—can we say that the law is embedded in society? \n \nSince the financial crisis of 2008, embeddedness has become a fashionable metaphor for describing the dysfunctional \nrelationships between law, economy and society; notably non -entities that we can observe only through their social \nconstruction. Following the 2008 financial crisis, a consensus emerged that the three spheres had drifted apart, leaving some  \ncommunities underserved and others elided altogether. Previously, a preference fo r scientism had seen the three spheres \nseparate out into silos of research and activity, reflected in our conceptual and linguistic tools for each. We talk about ‘t he \neconomy’ as if it were a real thing.61 Similarly, we refer to the ‘the law’ as if it were an entity, using ontological metaphors to \nlump together useful collections of social behaviours for linguistic convenience. This fiction has the effect of masking the social \nconstruction of both law and economy and of maintaining the metaphorical fiction of the ontologically separate law, economy \nand society. As the above discussion noted, problems arise when we lose sight of the divergence between our linguistic fictions \nand our social facts, the concepts baked into these fictions and the heavy lifting we  are asking them to do. At the same time, \nour linguistic and conceptual tools encode preferences and assumptions that have become invisible through ubiquity and \nfamiliarity but tend to reproduce neoclassical and doctrinal approaches. These, in turn, generate inequalities. For those whose \ninterests align with the hegemonic values of dominant legal and economic frames, the outcome is privilege. In other words, our \nlinguistic tools pick winners. For those whose interests do not align with the dominant rational ities of neoclassical law and \neconomics, simply finding the vocabularies and grammars to express their needs can prove an exclusionary hurdle. Inequalities \nthat result tend to remain largely ignored by AI de -biasing work, which, for the most part, remains focused on gendered and \nracialised language. By contrast, the inequalities resulting from our linguistic framing remain, like the frames that give rise to \nthem, largely invisible. \n \nFor decades, while the political right has been asking us to think of elephants, the political left has been asking us not to think \nof elephants.62 While the political right has funded research posts, think tanks and university chairs, aligning rhetoric with their \npolitical ideals, the left has failed to respond adequately. In re framing the debate, both in the United States and, to a lesser \nextent, Europe, the right has devised such phrases as ‘tax relief’. 63 This phrase implies that tax, being a burden, is something \nthe government can offer relief from. Such shifts in framing ten d to occur at the micro- and meso-levels, with one word here \nand one word there. But the net impact occurs at the macro-levels of social institutions and the meta-levels of our wider shared \nconceptual tools.64 \n \nIn simply arguing that ‘tax relief is a bad idea’, the political left repeats, re-entrenches and reinforces frames set by the political \nright, ironically strengthening the political right’s view of the world through repetition. Instead, to challenge a frame, we must \nreframe, and this might involve replacing the phrase ‘tax relief’ with, for example, ‘reduced investment’.65 Challenging frames, \nthen, demands a deep understanding of the linguistics and psychology behind the effectiveness of framing.66 Reframing is not \na quick fix but propagated over deca des; the cumulative realisation of myriad micro -level shifts in language that add up to \nwider changes in how we perceive legal, economic, social and political phenomena. In the meantime, we are left with the \nconceptual and linguistic tools of homo economicus-juridicus, for the most part, like Asimov, unable to imagine anything \ndifferent. As MacKenzie and Millo suggestively propose, what if we were able to imagine the socially networked, morally \n \n59 Lakoff, Don’t Think of an Elephant. \n60 Lakoff, cited in Geary, I is an Other, Loc. 1950. \n61 Kelsen, On the Theory of Juridic Fictions; Samuel, Rethinking Legal Reasoning. \n62 Lakoff, Don’t Think of an Elephant. \n63 Example from Lakoff, Don’t Think of an Elephant. \n64 See Frerichs, Studying Law, Economy, and Society. \n65 Lakoff, Don’t Think of an Elephant. \n66 The linguistic turn that had its impact on law in the 1980s and motivated much of the critical legal studies movement ‘suffered from the \ndominance of analytic linguistic philosophy and the continuing  drive to science’. While semiotics has offered support for positivist \njurisprudence and legal semiotics came to be an exercise in mapping the linguistic presuppositions of legal theory, the role of rhetoric was \noverlooked. See Goodrich, “Rhetoric, Semiotics, Synasthetics,” 153–154. \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 119  \n \nconstructed notion of homo sociologicus?67 What vocabulary might they deploy? And which interests and values might they \nbe able to balance? \n \nWhile homo sociologicus remains a pipe dream, and while our conceptual and linguistic tools are, to a large extent, those \naligning with neoliberal voices and values, this might appear a curious time to be curating data that will train future foundation \nmodels. At issue is the wider lack of awareness about the preferences and biases baked into our language that fall below the \nlevel of discriminatory or biased discourse. If our fram es are those of the political right and if these are being curated into \nfoundation models, they are likely to be reproduced in all downstream applications, be these in healthcare, education, or legal \nservices, perpetuating the assumptions of neoclassical economics and doctrinal law wherever AI is deployed. In the process, \nthe voices, interests and values that align with hegemonic frames will enjoy privilege, while those that do not will continue to \nbe sidelined or silenced. The net result, perpetuated throu gh future AI systems, is the framing of our future actions, and our \nfuture selves, as homines economici-juridici. \n \n7. Harm and Asimov’s Zeroth Law: Language as Technology \n \nBefore being let loose on the public, all new doctors must swear the Hippocratic Oath: a pledge of ethics in which they promise, \nabove all else, to do no harm. Similarly, Asimov’s Zeroth Law of robotics states that a robot may not harm humanity or, by \ninaction, allow humanity to come to harm. While we can appreciate that explicitly discriminatory language can cause harm, to \nwhat extent can we say the same for inequalities perpetuated by our framing of legal and economic phenomena? \n \nIn many contexts, ‘machine learning has been shown to contribute to, and potentially amplify, societal inequality’, and \nfoundation models ‘may extend this trend’. 68 And at each step, the conceptual and linguistic tools that encode hegemonic \nassumptions and preferences become further entrenched, more ubiquitous and less available to challenge. But there is startlingly \nlittle awareness of the use of Transformers such as BERT and GPT -3 and how they might be shaping societies and ourselves \nin the process. For example, were you aware of Google’s upgrade to BERT in 2019?69 Have you consented for your data to be \nused to train future generations of foundation models? \n \nWhile de-biasing initiatives tend to focus on racialised and gendered language, and work on implicit bias is increasing, our \nframing remains largely unnoticed, as little more than tacit, taken -for-granted background noise of social institutions. 70 In \npreserving these, we risk perpetuating structural inequalities that can produce tangible harms for sections of the population. At \nwhat point, then, might an AI system be compelled to intervene to adjust the damaging effects of the conceptual and linguistic \ntools baked into its foundation model? And if it determines the harm too great, then what? \n \nA starting assumption here is the acknowledgement that entrenched and systemic socio-economic disadvantage might constitute \nharm.71 Of course, neoliberal frames are able to justify (to human minds at least) the inequalities they produce according to \ntheir own internal logics. So, a lack of access to justice, for example, might be explained as the result of an individual’s inability \nto maximise their own utility, meaning that they do not have sufficient funds to hire a lawyer.72 Might an AI system agree, or \ntake a more critical approach? \n \nAs previous sections noted, any challenge to existing frames depends on an acknowledgement that our conceptual and linguistic \ntools are not immutable rules of nature. Yet even the framing of AI as ‘natural’ language processing forecloses the idea that we \nmight consider alternatives. Our current linguistic tools are the product of careful curation and design over generations by those \nseeking to achieve political ends, namely the minimisation of the state, prioritisation of the individual and centrality of the self-\nregulating market. In short, the language on which BERT was trained is no more ‘natural’ than space travel or the intern et.73 \n \n67 MacKenzie, “Constructing a Market,” 141. \n68 Bommasani, “On the Opportunities,” 19; Blodgett, “Language (Technology) is Power”; Bender, “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots”; \nSap, “Social Bias Frames.” \n69 Uszkoreit, “Transformer”; Nayak, “Understanding Searches.” \n70 Sap, “Social Bias Frames”; Liang, “Towards Understanding.” \n71 Currently debates are framed in terms of socio-economic disadvantage and inequalities. See Layard, “Vehicles for Justice.” \n72 Socio-economic justice is critical, given the overlaps between procedural and substantive inequalities. However, legal duties to address \nthis remain inadequate. See Layard, “Vehicles for Justice.” Causation, along with standing, is problematic, and parallels can be seen in climate \nlitigation where legal tools to address clear dangers appear lacking. Nevertheless, the application of AI to legal fora promises to  improve \naccess to information and justice by reducing costs. See Dale, “Law and Word Order.” \n73 Note that the data on which foundation models are trained are curated. Humans determine what is important and what is not, what is \nrelevant and what is not, thus (normatively) determining the language on which BERT and its descendants will be trained. \nVolume 4 (2) 2022  Williams \n 120  \n \nYet in describing the language BERT and its peers can process as ‘natural’, we elide the normative and analytical choices that \ncreated this language. In losing sight of the rhetoric of all language, we simultaneously risk placing notions like homo \nsociologicus permanently beyond imagination. \n \nAdditionally, this elides the contingencies and contestation that occurs in language about which ideas we realise (or aspire to), \nwhich voices we hear and which interests we highlight. Preferences for the self-regulating market, and even the opposition of \nmarket and state as a binary, are bound up with and reproduced in our wider linguistic tools, becoming encoded in the data \ntraces we leave every time we interact online. Like the indicators noted above in section  5, we might think of language as \ntechnology, with the potential to regulate interactions and discipline those who dare to deviate.74 For example, have you ever \naltered your spelling or grammar on a computer simply to make those little red squiggles disappear? In homogenising language \nand in labelling it ‘natural’, the normative binary (is your spelling right or wrong) disciplines deviation, marking out divergence \nas other. In doing so, pluralistic voices, interests and values are minimised. \n \nWe undoubtedly need a greater awareness of how we do, talk and think about legal and economic phenomena —that is, how \nwe frame law and economy. This paper has suggested a research agenda for AI developers and socio-legal researchers to look \nbeyond social and representati onal biases to the deep, subconscious structures and institutions that we perform through our \nlinguistic tools. Our hegemonic conceptual and linguistic tools have intrinsic limitations, prioritising some interests while  \nminimising others. Challenging this status quo demands a greater appreciation of how we frame—and are framed by—law and \neconomy on a daily basis. In the meantime, we risk sleepwalking into preserving our current conceptual and linguistic tools, \nwith their baked-in assumptions and preferences, in digital aspic—perhaps forever. In his Foundation series, Asimov shows us \nwhat might happen when we lose sight of the social construction of law and economy. Our risks are greater though. While \nAsimov penned novels that occasionally jar, we risk the potential entrenchment of inequalities in future AI systems. In short, \nthe way we talk matters. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nGrateful thanks to the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) SeNSS (South East Network for Social Sciences) \nfor funding.
