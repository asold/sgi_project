Alzheimer’s disease is mainly \ncaused by an abnormal build-up of protein in and around brain cells where one of the \nprotein amyloid deposit and form plaque around the brain [1, 2]. Due to aging, the diag-\nnoses of Alzheimer’s disease are tedious task; therefore, Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n(MRI) is used for disease detection to help doctors [3–6]. \nCertain processes are involved in Alzheimer’s disease detection from MRI images, \nthe processesare pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. \nInitially, the MRI images are pre-processed due to noise-prone characteristics and con-\ntain non-brain tissues (eye, fat, muscles, dura, scalp, skin, etc.) where some existing \nworks nevermore perform skull stripping and several existing works don’t consider \nnoise reduction (i.e. Rician noise, Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, etc.) which \nmoderation them with less classification accuracy [7–12]. After pre-processing, seg-\nmentation was performed to increase the classification accuracy and reduce complexity. \nSegmentation is one of the major processes to segment the gray matter, white matter \nand cerebrospinal fluid to extract the significant features for classification. Some of the \nexisting work doesn’t perform segmentation and the majority of the existing works \naccomplished the segmentation using automated image analyzing tool such as statis -\ntical parametric mapping (SPM), FreeSurfer and FSL-FAST4 which consume more \ncomputational time to perform full segmentation, lack of validation, automated meth -\nods in estimating the volume will not accurate and the automated tools compare inten-\nsity to atlas on to guide segmentation this augment issues of loss of fine information \nwhich leads to segmentation problem and affect the segmentation accuracy [11, 13–16].\nIn most of the existing work, the neural network algorithms are used for feature \nextraction and classification which only extract single feature or limited features that \nare insufficient to perform Alzheimer’s disease classification [ 17, 18]. The existing \nworks utilize machine learning (ML), neural network and deep learning (DL) algo -\nrithms, the ML algorithms such as support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest \nneighbor, random forest etc.., which has high training complexity due to large number \nof trees generated while feature extraction and some of the algorithms are not appro -\npriate for large dataset [12, 17, 19]. The ML limitations are resolved by deep learning \nwhich employs neural network for feature extraction and classification such as con -\nvolutional neural network, multilayer perceptron and radial basis function [20–24]. \nHowever, this algorithm generates large number of hidden layers, high convergence \nweight and consumes high computational time which increases the high complexity \nand affects the classification accuracy. The challenges faced by automated tool while \nsegmentation was addressed by swin transformer-based semantic segmentation then \nthe provocation and insufficiency while feature extraction was solved by multi-scale \nfeature extraction with effective architecture which reduces the high complexity and \nhigh false positive rate. \nFor Alzheimer’s disease detection, most of the existing works used neural networks \nfor feature extraction and classification. However, it increases the high complexity \nand reduces the accuracy of classification. Several important problems present in the \nexisting work are described as follows in Table 1 [1].\niJOE ‒ Vol. 19, No. 04, 2023\n23\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\nTable 1. Most relevant problems – state-of-the-art methods \nProblems Description \nLack of Pre- \nprocessing\nMost of the existing work performs pre-processing, whereas some works don’t perform \nskull stripping and noise reduction which affects the classification accuracy due to \npresence of noise and non-brain tissues (eye, scalp, fat, dura, skin etc.).\nInadequate \nfeatures\nMany of the existing works used the texture analysis to extract texture features. \nAnd some of them extracted only the limited features (low-level features) where these \nfeatures are insufficient to classify the disease and affect the true positive rate.\nHigh \nComplexity\nIn some of the existing works the features are extracted from the entire MRI image \nwithout segmenting the region of interest which increases the high complexity. Several \nexisting works utilized the convolutional neural network which generates numerous \nunwanted layers while feature extraction which leads to high complexity. \n Then most  \nof the works employed support vector machine for classification which are not suitable \nfor large dataset.\nWe are motivated the abovementioned problems with the aim of detecting and clas-\nsifying the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using MRI images. In addition, this research \nidentifies the problem of considering lack of pre-processing, inadequate feature, high \ncomplexity and so on. The main objective of this research is to perform mathematical \nmodeling for classifying the Alzheimer’s disease using MRI images with low false \npositive rate and high accuracy. The remaining objectives of this research are described \nas follows:\n1. To enhance the quality of MRI images, pre-processing is initialized by noise reduc-\ntion, removal of non-brain tissues and bias field correction that increase the true \npositive rate.\n2. To extract the feature effectively, semantic segmentation is performed to segment the \ngray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid which reduce the high complexity.\n3. To increase the classification accuracy, significant features are extracted in  \nmulti-scale from the segmented image which reduces the high false positive rate.\nTo make it clear, this research mainly focuses on detecting AD accurately using \nMRI images with high accuracy. The major contributions of this research are listed as \nfollows:\n1. Initially, we perform tri-level pre-processing, in first level we perform noise removal \nby HKIF algorithm which removes the noise and preserves the edge information of \nthe images, in second level we perform skull stripping by extracting brain images \nusing GAC which increases accuracy and reduces complexity. In third level, we \nperform bias filed correction to increase the intensity of the images which is done by \nEM algorithm that helps to increase the quality of the images. \n2. Swin transformer-based segmentation is performed to segment gray matter, white \nmatter, and cerebrospinal fluid of brain which is done byST-MUNet algorithm, this \nprocess increases the detection accuracy of AD, and MCI.\n3. Multi-scale feature extraction based AD detection is performed by MSFP-VGG16 \nwhich extracts multiple features (i.e, structural, statistical, edge, blobs, color,  \n24\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\nand contour) in multi-scale format that provides additional information of the fea-\ntures which increases classification accuracy. The proposed MSFP-VGG16 classi-\nfies the images into three classes namely normal, AD, and MCI.\nThe performance of this research is evaluated by various performance metrics such \nas accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, and positive predictive value.  \nThis paper is structured as follows; Section 3 explains the detailed summary of the litera-\nture review and its research gap. Section 2 explains the major problem statement which are \naddressed from the existing works and solved by the proposed work. Section 4 illustrates \nthe research methodology which explains the research methodology, pseudocode, algo-\nrithm, and mathematical formulations. Section 5 illustrates the detailed description of the \nexperimentation study of the proposed work. Section 6 concludes the conclusion.\n2 Problem statement \nIn [23], an automated detection model for Alzheimer’s detection using T2 weighted \nbrain MRI images is proposed. Here, Alzhiemer disease is classified by Support Vector \nMachine (SVM) Poly-1 and Random Forest algorithm. The major problems of this \nresearch are expressed as follows:\n1. In this work, the features are extracted from the entire image without focusing on \nregion of interest (GM, WM, and CSF) that increase the high complexity.\n2. The local binary pattern (LBP) was employed for feature fusion which produces \nrather long histogram that leads to slow down the model performance and affect the \ntrue positive rate. \n3. Here, the model does not allow for training larger dataset due to its low computation \ncapacity therefore the model does not suitable for large dataset that affects the clas-\nsification accuracy. \nThe author proposed a deep learning method for Alzheimer classification using T1 \nweighted MRI images [25]. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) was used for classifying \ncognitive normal (CN), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive \nimpairment (LMCI) and AD. The research issues are listed as follows, \n1. In this work, the pre-processing was performed for bias field correction, B1 non-uni-\nformity and grad-warp where skull stripping is the main process, lack of consider -\nation leads to less true positive rate.\n2. Here, only texture features were considered for Alzheimer’s disease classification. \nHowever, lack of considering other significant features (i.e., structural, statistics, \nedge etc.) will affect the classification performance and its accuracy.\n3. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) was employed for classification, where it gen-\nerates many hidden nodes and convergence of the weight will be very slow which \ndegrades the model performance and it leads to high complexity.\nThe author proposed a deep fusion method for Alzheimer’s detection using T1 \nMRI image from ADNI dataset [26]. Searchlight was utilized for feature extraction \nfrom specific position of brain and the SVM classifies the images into AD and normal.  \nThe main research problems of this research are listed as follows,\niJOE ‒ Vol. 19, No. 04, 2023\n25\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\n1. Here, the segmentation was performed on raw image, where the presence of non-\nbrain tissues, noise and intensity inhomogeneity affect the image quality and leads \nto high false positive rate.\n2. In this work, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was utilized for segmentation, \nwhere it was an automatic image analysing tool, which is not suitable for any other \ndataset’s segmentation process this affects the classification accuracy. \n3. The support vector machine (SVM) was employed for Alzheimer’s disease classifi-\ncation which doesn’t perform well on large dataset due to its high training complica-\ntion that leads to high complexity.\nThe author proposed a method for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s detection using \nT2 weighted MRI from ADNI database [27]. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) \nwas utilized to perform feature extraction and classification into three classes such as \nnormal, MCI, and AD.\n1. In this work, the pre-processing was performed to enhance the image quality and \nskull stripping where bias filed correction and noise reduction were not considered \nwhich leads to affect the image quality and classification accuracy.\n2. Here, the clustering-based segmentation was performed where random initialization \nof centroid of cluster lack of consistency in determination of abnormalities that leads \nto high false positive rate.\n3. The feature extraction and classification were performed by Convolutional Neural \nNetwork (CNN) which generates large number of unwanted layers while feature \nextraction that leads to high complexity.\n3 Related work \nIn paper [28], the authors proposed a machine-learning model for Alzheimer’s dis -\nease diagnosis using T1 MRI images. Initially, the pre-processing was performed using \nFreeSurfer software for skull stripping, image registration, cortical segmentation, and \nthickness estimation then the brain regions are segmented using the same software and \n63 volumetric features are obtained. The Welch’s test was used for feature selection \nand 22 significant features are selected for classification. Finally, the classification \nwas performed by Random Forest which classifies into three classes as Normal, MCI \nand Alzheimer’s disease. Here, the classification was performed using Random Forest \nwhich generates a large number of trees for a large dataset during classification increases \nhigh complexity and high latency. Authors in [29], proposed a model for Alzheimer’s \ndisease detection using T1 weighted MRI images. Initially, the pre-processing was  \nperformed for skull removal using FreeSurfer, then sampling, clipping, and intensity \nnormalization are executed. The feature extraction and classification were accom -\nplished using Modified U-net, which has skip-connection to fuse low-level information \nand high-level semantic features. Finally, the structural features are used for classifi-\ncation which classifies normal, early cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impair-\nment, and Alzheimer’s disease. In this work, the feature extraction was performed on \nthe overall image instead of focusing on the region of interest which leads to high \ncomplexity in extracting features from the overall image.\n26\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\nThe authors proposed a deep learning model for Alzheimer’s and Dementia dis -\nease diagnosis using MRI images [5]. Initially, the pre-processing was performed to \nbalance the dataset using Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and \nthe normalization was executed. The DEMNET network was implemented for feature \nextraction and disease detection where the convolutional layers extract the discrimi -\nnate features from the pre-processed image. Finally, the softmax layer classifies into \nfour classes such as non-AD, very mild AD, mild AD, and moderate AD. Here, the \npre-processing was only performed to balance the dataset where the presence of non-\nbrain tissues, noise, and intensity in homogeneity affects the classification accuracy. In \npaper [30], the author’s deep and conventional machine learning model for Alzheimer’s \ndisease detection using T1 MRI images. Initially, the N4 algorithm was used to correct \nthe non-uniformity and skull stripping, and then a non-rigid B-spline transformation \nmodel was implemented for pair wise registration. The gray matter was segmented and \nthe feature map was extracted using a statistical parametric mapping from the pre-pro-\ncessed image. Finally, the deep convolutional neural network and conventional SVM \nclassify into normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. The gray \nmatter segmentation and feature map were extracted by statistical parametric mapping \nwhich is an analyzing tool and it will not suitable for all the datasets that leads to high \nfalse positive rate. Authors in [31], proposed an automatic classification method for \nAlzheimer’s detection using T1 MRI images. Initially, the FMRIB’s software library \n(FSL) and brain extraction tool were used for skull stripping then the gray matter, white \nmatter, and CSF are segmented using FSL-FAST4 automated segmentation tool. Then \nFreeSurfer software was implemented for feature extraction based on cortical thickness \nand 63 features are extracted. The Six classifiers are executed separately for classifica-\ntion into normal, early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impair-\nment (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, the SVM with radial basis function \nobtained high accuracy. In this work, the feature extraction was performed using Free-\nSurfer, which resulted in errors in terms of precise borders of a different brain region, \nwhich will affect the true positive rate.\nIn paper [32], authors proposed a deep learning method for early diagnosis of  \nAlzheimer’s disease using MRI images. Initially, the pre-processing was performed \nusing non-local mean algorithm for normalization, standardization, and resize then the \ndata augmentation was performed to avoid data scarcity. The feature extraction and \nclassification were performed using two methods, the first method was employed by \nCNN and the second method was using the transfer learning method. Finally, the fea -\ntures are extracted and classified into normal, EMCI, LMCI, and AD. In this work, \nthe features are extracted from the overall images without segmenting the GM, WM, \nand CSF which leads to high complexity. In paper [27], the authors proposed a deep \nlearning method for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease using T2 MRI images \nfrom two datasets. Initially, the pre-processing was performed to remove the non-brain \ntissues using the skull stripping algorithm. The Enhanced independent component anal-\nysis was used for segmenting the gray matter which is used to estimate the atrophy \nchanges. The CNN based on inception type of block was proposed for feature extraction \nand classification which extract the deep features. Finally, the softmax layer classifies \ninto normal, AD, and MCI. The convolutional neural network was used for feature \niJOE ‒ Vol. 19, No. 04, 2023\n27\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\nextraction and classification, where it takes long time to train, especially with large \ndataset which leads to high false positive rate. The authors proposed a deep transfer \nlearning model for Alzheimer’s disease detection using MRI images [33]. Initially, \nthe images are channelized, resize and the images were cropped to remove the white \nspace and enhance the data. Then, the images are augmented to balance the dataset \nand the CNN was utilized for feature extraction, the convolutional layers at starting of \nCNN’s filters extract the low-level features such as edge, blobs, and color and the net -\nwork end learns the global, high level and complicated features. Finally, by using CNN \nbased transfer learning technique the softmax classifies into AD, MCI, and normal. The \npre-processing was performed to channelize, resized, and crop to remove the white \nspace, where lack of skull stripping, noise reduction, and bias field correction affects \nthe classification accuracy.\nFeature selection-based AD classification was performed by using optimization and \nmachine learning algorithms [34]. Initially, the input images were pre-processed and \nnormalized for improving the quality of the images. The pre-processed images were \nsent to feature selection phase which were done by genetic with logistic regression \nalgorithm. The selected features were sent to classification phase which was done by \nsupport vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest algorithm which \nclassified the images into AD/NC, AD/MCI. The performance of this research was \nevaluated by ADNI dataset that prove the proposed work achieved better performance \nin AD detection and classification. Here, machine learning algorithm was proposed for \nAD detection which takes high training time for large dataset that reduces the training \nperformance of AD detection and classification. \nDeep learning-based AD detection using MRI images [35]. This research includes \nthree processes such as pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Here, \n3D MRI images were taken as an input, and thenpre-processing was performed for \nimage slicing. The sliced images were sent to the CNN algorithm which performs \nfeature extraction. Here, transfer learning was applied to the CNN for efficient fea-\nture extraction. The extracted features were fed into RNN which classified the images \ninto AD or NC. The performance of this research was evaluated by ADNI dataset. \nAD detection was performed by incorporating CNN and VGG-16 using MRI images \n[36]. Initially, MRI images were collected from kaggle for AD detection. After that, \nfeature extraction was performed by VGG-16, based on the extracted features neural \nnetwork was classified the images into four classes such as mild, moderate, very mild, \nand normal. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed work achieved \nsuperior performance in accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure, AUC and ROC curve. \nHere, features were extracted from the noisy images which lead to less classification \nand detection accuracy. Automatic detection of AD and MCI was performed using \nMRI images [37]. Initially, MRI images were collected from ADNI dataset for AD and \nMCI detection. Then perform image resizing and slicing for accurate detection of AD.  \nHere, deep convolutional neural network extracted the features automatically from the \nsliced MRI images. The proposed convolutional neural network includes depth wise \nand point wise convolutions for increasing the performance of feature extraction which \nextracts the features in multiple views. The classification includes two classes such as \nAD and MCI.

The MRI images have certain noises such as Speckle noise, Gauss-\nian noise, and so on. Removal of these noises is required to enhance the MRI image \nquality. For this purpose, we proposed Hybrid of Kuan and Improved Frost filters \n(HKIF) where these filters remove noise and smoothen the image without removing \nedge features which is shown in Figure 2. Here, the noisy images are fed into HKIF \nwhereas the Kuan filter and frost filter provides the noise removed images which are \nincorporated and provided the final noise removal image. The Kuan filter depends on \nthe effective count of looks which is the main parameter since that needs to adjust \nfor every image to tune the parameters of the filter for obtaining efficient results in \nnoise removal. Here, the Kuan filter automatically evaluated the optimal parameter of \nthe filter based upon edge pixels that provides effective results. Let consider W is the \nwindow centre of the filter with pixel coordinates (p, q). C\nW is the centre pixels in W \nand δ is weighted value. The Kuan filter gray level pixel positions are given as follows,\n \nFp qC WW W(, )( )/g32/g14/g72/g71 /g72/g16  (1)\nwhere εW represent the mean value inside the filter window W. The weight value of \nthe filter is evaluated as follows,\n \n/g71 /g72\n/g72\n/g32/g16\n/g14\n1\n1\n22\n2\nCC\nC\ni/  (2)\n \nCiW W= ρε /  (3)\nwhere ρW is represent the standard deviation in W, and \nCl ookn/g72/g321/ . The lookn \nmetric efficiently manages the smoothing volume which is applied in the image by \nchanging the coefficient of noise variation C\nε. The value of look n is represent the effi-\ncient number of looks ( γ   ) of the given image which is closure to the actual lookn of \nthe noisy image. If the lookn has smaller values, then it represents more smoothening, \notherwise it preserves the edge information of the image. The value of lookn is adjusted \nto control the performance of the filter. The calculation of γ is defined as follows,\n \n/g74/g80/g85/g32(/ )rr\n2  (4)\nwhere mr represent the mean value of the even image region ( r), and ρr represent \nthe standard deviation of the even image region. For identifying the uniform areas \nof the image, the image is divided into 25 × 25 sub images, and calculated the γ for \neach sub images, finally average two sub images value of γ\n  for obtaining final γ  value.  \nLet consider look n = γ at initial stage, and then the values are adjusted by manually \nwhich is calculated as follows,\n30\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\n \nlook an =+()1 γ  (5)\nwhere a represent the coefficient of adjustment parameter, and the value of a changes \nwith variance of noise (an) and detail of image (ad) which is formulated as follows,\n \naa adn=+  (6)\nIn this way, image noises are removed by using kuan filter. Parallelly, the noisy \nimages are sent to the improved frost filter for noise removal. Here, the window size \nand tuning factors are adaptively changed based on regional characteristics. The math-\nematical representation of frost filter is defined below,\n \n(, )/ij pe\nxy\nxy xy\nxy\nxy xy\nkh DIx y/g32/g32/g166/g166 /g166/g166\n/g16\n/g80/g80 /g80\n2  (7)\nwhere (i, j) represent the current pixel location, \n(, )ij  is filter output, and pxy is the \npixels values between window centre at \n(, ), ()ij kk >0  represent the factor of tuning \nparameter, and \nhI  represent the variation coefficient which is defined as ration between \nsample mean and standard deviation, and \nD xy  is distance between the pixels to cen -\ntre pixels. The value of k is small, then improved frost filter perform noise removal \nefficiently, but it does not preserve edge information accurately. The value of k is \nincreased, then it effectively preserves the edge information effectively. Hence, the \nsize of the window is adjusted dynamically based on adaptive windowing method.  \nLet assume (i\n, j) represent the current location of the pixel, and the threshold calculation \nof the current window is defined as follows,\n \nhij\nij\nij\n/g32\n/g85\n/g80  (8)\n \nTr\nS\nij\nf\nwi j\nf/g32/g14\n/g14\n/g16/g11/g12\n/g167\n/g169\n/g168\n/g168/g168\n/g183\n/g185\n/g184\n/g184/g184\n/g117/g69\n/g85\n/g851\n12\n1\n2  (9)\nwhere \nµij  represent the mean value, and \nρij  is the standard deviation of the current \nwindow. \nTrij  is represent the threshold value which effectively smoothened the image. \nρf\n2\n denotes the noise variance and \nSwi j  represent the size of the current window, \nβ  is \ndenotes the system parameter.

Here, variation coefficient \nhij  is not bigger than \nTrij , then the window size is grad-\nually increases for obtaining better results. In this way, improved frost filter performs \nnoise removal and edge preservation.

Process of noise reduction\nSkull stripping. The main process of pre-processing is skull stripping in Alzheimer’s \ndisease detection, which is the process of segmenting the brain tissues by removing non-\nbrain tissues (fat, scalp, muscles, dura etc.) from surrounding region which improves \nthe robustness of the disease detection. For that purpose, we proposed GAC is a contour \nmodel that adjusts the smooth curve and constructs closed contour for region. Figure 3 \nrepresents the skull stripping input and output. Initially, we defined the edge indicator \nof the image \n()E I\n which is expressed as follows,\n32\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\n \nE\ngI\nI /g32\n/g14/g146/g117\n1\n1\n2\n/g85  (11)\nwhere \ngI/g85/g117  is used to remove the noise by performing Gaussian smoothing, and \n∇  \nrepresent the function of gradient. The function of edge indicator takes small values on \nimage boundaries compared to other regions. So, we can introduce level set function\n() :lsfr /g45/g58/g111\n which is formulated as follows, \n \n/g45()\n,\n,\n,\ns\nInfs ts B\nsB\nInfs ts B\ntB in\ntB out\n/g32\n/g16/g16 /g143\n/g143/g119\n/g16/g143\n/g173\n/g174\n/g176/g176\n/g175\n/g176\n/g176\n/g143/g119\n/g143/g119\n2\n2\n0  (12)\nwhere \nst− 2  is represent the distance between s and t, and \nBin , \nBout  and \n∂B  represent \nthe outside, boundary, and inside of the object respectively. Here, segmentation contour \nϑ\n has the value of zero.

The GAC \nenergy function is integrated with penalty and area which are expressed as follows,\n ȴ \n/g45/g45/g11/g12/g32/g16\n/g58/g179Ed xI\nn\nh()  (15)\n \nN /g45/g45/g11/g12/g32/g146/g16/g11/g12/g179\n1\n2 1\n2\n/g58\nn\ndx  (16)\nwhere \nh()ϑ  represent the function of Heaviside, the weight value of area and \ninitial contour values are essential. If the initial value of contour is present inside the \nobjects, the weight values of area must be positive so that shrink the zero \nlsf\n of contour \nthrough evolution. On the divergence, if the initial contour is pinched inside the object, \nthe area weight values are negative so that it enlarges to the zero-level set contour.  \nThese types of shrinking and expanding procedure are followed in GAC for extracting \nbrain regions, and removing skull regions in the MRI images. \nἡ\niJOE ‒ Vol. 19, No. 04, 2023\n33\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\n(a) (b)\nFig. 3.

This section also proved that the proposed work \nachieved superior performance in AD detection compared to existing approaches.\n5.1 Dataset description\nIn this research, we have used Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) \ndataset for AD detection. This dataset includes T1 weighted brain MRI images. This \ndataset provides the data of AD which also includes 3D volumetric data. That becomes \nlightly difficult to work on 3D images, hence we have considered only 2D images \nwhich are extracted from the ADNI dataset that includes three classes of data such as \nAD, MCL, and normal subjects. The details of dataset are shown in table. Figure 6 \nrepresents the sample brain images of ADNI dataset. Table 2 depicts the training and \ntesting images presented in the ADNI dataset. \nTable 2.

The performance of the proposed work is compared \n42\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\nwith existing works in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive \nvalue, and confusion matrix. \nImpact of accuracy. This metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of AD detection \nand classification. It is calculated by dividing the sum of true positive rate and true \nnegative by sum of all samples. The mathematical expression of accuracy is defined \nas follows,\n Ǟ\n/g32\n/g14\n/g14/g14/g14\ntt\ntt ff\npn\npn pn  (35)\nwhere \ntp  is true positive, \ntn  is true negative, \nfp  represent the false positive rate, and \nfn  \nrepresent the false negative. Figure 7 represents the comparison of accuracy with num-\nber of images. The comparison proved that the proposed ST-Seg model achieves high \naccuracy compared to existing models. The existing BEMD model does not perform \nnoise removal or skull stripping, hence it performed AD detection with the presence of \nnoise and non-brain regions that leads to poor detection accuracy. In addition, features \nare extracted by local binary pattern algorithm to extract the features from the whole \nbrain image which leads to high complexity and misclassification that reduces detection \naccuracy. In Ex-PFE model perform AD detection by considering both brain and non-\nbrain images which leads to misclassification and poor accuracy. Additionally, it per -\nforms AD detection by considering single feature (i.e., textural) which is not enough for \naccurate AD detection which leads to less accuracy compared to our proposed ST-Seg \nmodel. In our proposed ST-Seg model consider many features (i.e., textural, structural, \nedge, blobs, color, and contour) for detecting AD which leads to high accuracy, addition-\nally, we remove non-brain (i.e., skull stripping) tissues from the MRI image for increas-\ning accuracy. The proposed ST-Seg model achieves (0.98) higher than existing models. \n0.7\n0.74\n0.78\n0.82\n0.86\n0.9\n0.94\n0.98\n20 40 60 80 100\nAccuracy\n# of images\nBEMD Ex-PFE ST-Seg\nFig. 7.

The mathematical representation of \nspecificity is defined as follows,\n ß \n/g32/g14\nt\ntf\nn\nnp  (36)\niJOE ‒ Vol. 19, No. 04, 2023\n43\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\nwhere ß represent specificity, the definition of specificity is denoted as the true  \npositive rate is divided by the sum of true negative and false positive. Figure 8 \nillustrates the comparison of specificity with respect to number of images which proved \nthat the proposed work achieved superior performance in terms of specificity com -\npared to existing works. The proposed ST-Seg model perform noise removal, skull \nstripping, and bias field correction before initiating segmentation which increases true \npositive rate because of reducing unwanted tissues and noises form the image that \nleads to high specificity. The existing BEMD model perform only contrast enhance -\nment and Ex-PFE model perform only bias field correction which reduces correctness \nof detection due to poor quality of images. The Ex-PFE model consider only texture \nfeature for disease detection which increases misclassification and reduces specificity. \nIn addition, the BEMD model does not focusing on segmentation for detection which \nis one of the significant processes to accurately classified the disease, hence it achieves \nless specificity. The proposed ST-Seg model achieves high (0.93) specificity compared \nto existing models.\n20 40 60 80 100\n# of images\nBEMD Ex-PFE ST-Seg\n0.6\n0.65\n0.7\n0.75\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\n1\nSpecificity\nFig. 8. Comparison of specificity\nImpact of sensitivity. This metric is used to calculate the detection ability of positive \n(i.e., affected by disease) samples, which is also known as recall. In addition, it helps to \ncalculate the applicability from the detected samples. The mathematical expression of \nsensitivity is defined as below,\n Շ \n/g32/g14\nt\ntf\np\npn  (37)\nwhere Շ represent the sensitivity, Figure 9 represents the comparison of sensitiv -\nity with respect to number of images which shows that the proposed ST-Seg model \nachieves high sensitivity compared to existing models. The proposed ST-Seg model \nextract multi scale features for improving detection accuracy, but the existing works \nused single scale features which provide limited information about the features that \nleads to less detection accuracy and sensitivity. In addition, we have used attention lay-\ners (i.e., spatial and channel) in VGG-16 for given an importance for every feature \nthat increases sensitivity value during detection and classification of Alzheimer disease.  \nThe proposed ST-Seg model achieves high (0.9) sensitivity compared to existing models.\n44\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\n20 40 60 80 100\n# of images\nBEMD Ex-PFE ST-Seg\n0.6\n0.65\n0.7\n0.75\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\n1\nSensitivity\nFig. 9. Comparison of sensitivity\nImpact of positive predictive value. This metric is used to successfully identify the \npositive results. In other words, the proportion between truly identified as positive to \nall the samples that had positive results (i.e., normal persons). The mathematical repre-\nsentation of positive predictive value (₱) is defiend as follows,\n ₱ \n/g32/g14\nt\ntf\np\npp  (38)\nFigure 10 represents the comparison of proposed and existing positive predictive \nvalue with respect to number of images. The comparison result shows that the proposed \nwork achieved better performance in positive predictive value compared to existing \nworks. In this research, we have taken multiple features for segmenting GM, WM, and \nCSF using ST-MUNet algorithm which performs semantic segmentation that improves \nhigh positive predictive value, because discriminator evaluate the segmentation result \nto ground truth to improve segmentation accuracy which also increases positive \npredictive values. In addition, the proposed MSFP-VGG-16 takes multiple features \n(i.e., statistical, textural, structural, edge, color, blobs, and contour) in multi scale for \nimproving classification accuracy. But the existing works only consider limited features \nfor segmentation and classification with single scale for detecting AD which reduces the \npositive predictive value compared to out proposed work.

It is the matrix to represent the performance of AD \ndetection and classification achieved by the proposed ST-Seg model. It helps to pre -\ndict the tiny errors in the detection or classification.

Initially, preprocessing is performed to increases the quality of the images, for \nthat noise removal is performed by HKIF algorithm which removes the noise from the \nbrain MRI images, and then perform skull stripping to eliminate non-brain tissues and \nextracting brain tissues which increases the detection accuracy which is done by GAC \nalgorithm. After completed skull stripping, bias field correction is performed to correct \nthe intensity of the non-uniformity which increases the quality of the brain images \nwhich is done by EM algorithm. The preprocessed images are fed into segmentation for \nsegmenting gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid by considering cortical \nthickness, color, texture, and boundary information which is done by ST-MUNet. Here, \nthe preprocessed images are divided into multiple patches for performing segmenta -\ntion which increases the accuracy of segmentation. After completed segmentation, AD \ndetection and classification is done by MSFP-VGG16 algorithm which extracts the \nfeatures from multi scales and given an attention to features in terms of spatial and \nchannel which increases the accuracy of detection. Finally, the MRI brain images are \nclassified into three classes such as normal, AD, and MCI. \n46\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPaper—Swin Transformer-Based Segmentation and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Fusion Module for…\n7 References\n [1]  A.
