Miller2,3, Minh Tu Pham4, Richard Moreau4, \nRomeo Salemme2,3,5, Eric Koun2,3,5, Alessandro Farnè2,3,5,6,8 & Alice C. Roy1,2,6,8\nFollowing tool‑use, the kinematics of free‑hand movements are altered. This modified kinematic \npattern has been taken as a behavioral hallmark of the modification induced by tool ‑use on the \neffector representation. Proprioceptive inputs appear central in updating the estimated effector \nstate. Here we questioned whether online proprioceptive modality that is accessed in real time, or \noffline, memory‑based, proprioception is responsible for this update. Since normal aging affects \noffline proprioception only, we examined a group of 60 year‑old adults for proprioceptive acuity and \nmovement’s kinematics when grasping an object before and after tool ‑use. As a control, participants \nperformed the same movements with a weight—equivalent to the tool—weight ‑attached to their \nwrist. Despite hampered offline proprioceptive acuity, 60 year‑old participants exhibited the typical \nkinematic signature of tool incorporation: Namely, the latency of transport components peaks was \nlonger and their amplitude reduced after tool ‑use. Instead, we observed no kinematic modifications \nin the control condition. In addition, online proprioception acuity correlated with tool incorporation, \nas indexed by the amount of kinematics changes observed after tool ‑use. Altogether, these findings \npoint to the prominent role played by online proprioception in updating the body estimate for the \nmotor control of tools.\nAdapting the environment to our needs often requires the use of tools. Whether for leisure or for work, tools are \npresent in many aspects of our life, but their skillful control represents a challenge for our sensorimotor system. \nImagine a surgeon using tools with different sizes. The control exerted over the tip of different tools ought to be \naccurately adapted. To achieve this flexible control, the state of the effector (e.g., its position, dimensions, etc.) \nneeds to be continuously monitored. Such body estimate (or schema) is a critical element of motor control: it \nprovides the internal model with the information needed to execute actions  correctly\n1,2. Furthermore, it can \nupdate this information if rapid changes of the effector occur, as when grabbing objects with tools that temporar-\nily increase the size of the effector (i.e., arm + tool length). It is indeed well-established that using arm-elongating \ntools induces a temporary increase of the arm-length representation, as indexed by changes in movement kin -\nematics and tactile  perception3–9.\nIn the last decade, tool-use has emerged as a valuable paradigm to investigate plasticity of the body representa-\ntion for  action6,10–12. In a typical pre/post tool-use paradigm, participants are required to reach and grasp objects \nwith their hand, before and after using a mechanical grabber that elongates their arm’s reaching capabilities. The \npre-post tool-use comparison has consistently outlined a pattern of kinematics changes in the transport phase \nof the ensuing movements (noteworthy, without the tool), displaying smaller peaks (of acceleration, velocity and \ndeceleration) and longer latencies (of the same peaks). This pattern has been taken as the kinematic signature of \nthe so-called tool incorporation into the body state estimate. Indeed, movements performed after tool-use are \nakin to those observed when reaching with a naturally longer  arm\n6,13. Not least, the kinematic pattern general-\nizes to free hand movements that were not specifically exposed to tool-use (e.g., pointing instead of  grasping6), \nas well as to positions not exposed to tool-use (e.g., orthogonal to tool-use 13).\nOPEN\n1Laboratoire Dynamique du Langage, CNRS UMR 5596, University Lyon 2, Lyon, France. 2Integrative Multisensory \nPerception Action & Cognition Team—ImpAct, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center CRNL INSERM U1028, CNRS \nUMR5292, University UCBL Lyon 1, Lyon, France. 3University of Lyon, Lyon, France. 4Laboratoire Ampère, CNRS \nUMR5005, INSA Lyon, Univ Lyon, 69621 Villeurbanne, France. 5Hospices Civils de Lyon, Mouvement et Handicap \n& Neuro-immersion, Lyon, France. 6Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University of Trento, Rovereto, \nItaly. 7Present address: 16 Avenue du Doyen Jean Lépine, 69500 Bron, France. 8These authors contributed equally: \nAlessandro Farnè and Alice C.

Most importantly, proprioception is both sufficient and necessary to trigger such a plasticity, as \nproprioceptive deafferentation prevents updating the metrics of the arm estimate guiding our  action14. Overall, \nthese findings point toward a critical role played by proprioception in lengthening the estimated metrics of the \narm, which would thus influence subsequent movements execution, when the tool is no longer  held11.\nThis raises the question of whether online, or memory-based proprioception is responsible for the changes \nin free hand kinematics following tool-use. While the need for a constant monitoring of the effector state would \nfavor the online access hypothesis, an alternative possibility is that stored information is used, as tool-use effects \nare observable while the tool is no longer held. Proprioceptive information may indeed be accessed in real time \n(online) or, conversely, stored in order to be accessed later on (memory-based). This is reflected in different tasks \nfor testing position sense. In the contralateral matching task, a joint displacement is experienced and the partici-\npant has to reproduce the joint angle with his/her opposite arm. In the ipsilateral matching task, the participant \nexperiences the joint displacement only for a few seconds, then his/her arm is put back in the starting position \nand he/she has to reproduce the joint angle with the same arm. While the contralateral task typically taxes the \nonline access to proprioceptive information, the ipsilateral task taxes the offline access to  proprioception\n15. \nInterestingly, normal aging is known to affect  proprioception15,16, but it does not affect it evenly. Old adults are \nreported with a deficit regarding mostly the offline, as compared to the online access to proprioceptive  inputs17,18.\nHere we leveraged this dissociation to test whether tool-use effects on kinematics are mediated by online or \noffline proprioception processes. To this aim, we first assessed upper limb proprioceptive sensitivity in young \nadults (average 25 year-old), as well as in group of old adults (average 60 year-old) with both ipsilateral and \ncontralateral matching tasks. Several factors are at play in position matching tasks, as people may code for \nboth joint position and kinaesthetic amplitude of the movements  (see\n19). For the sake of comparison, here we \nleveraged tasks that already documented the off-line/online dissociation in old  adults17,18. Based on previous \n work17 we predicted that old participants would report less accurate proprioception in the ipsilateral, but not in \nthe contralateral matching task. Then, we assessed the same group of old participants for the emergence of the \nchanges in movement’s kinematics that have been typically reported after tool-use11. In line with the hypothesis \nthat efficient motor control requires online monitoring of the effector state estimate, we predicted that typical \nkinematic signature of tool-use should be observed in old adults with impaired offline, but spared online access \nto proprioception.\nMethods\nParticipants. Twenty participants (six males and fourteen females, mean age = 60.1 ± 5.05, range 51–69) \ntook part in this study. Three participants were left-handed as assessed through the Edinburgh Handedness \n Inventory\n20. None of the participants reported neurological or psychiatric disorders nor peripheral vascular \ndisease or peripheral neuropathy. All participants had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision and audition and \na normal range of upper limb movements. Participants provided written informed consent prior taking part in \nthe study, which was approved by the French ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est \nIV). All experimental procedures conformed to the Helsinki  declaration\n21.\nExperimental design. The experiment consisted of two sessions run over two consecutive days. A cogni-\ntive and proprioceptive assessment were performed on the first day, together with the first experimental session \nthat could be the tool-use session or the weighted-wrist session. The second day was an experimental session \nonly (tool-use or weighted-wrist), the order of sessions being counterbalanced across participants. As in previ-\nous work using this  paradigm\n6, the weighted-wrist session served as a within-subject control condition aimed at \nruling out any unspecific fatigue effects due to the weight of the tool, or test–retest effects, on arm representation. \nFor this reason, the weight attached to the wrist in the weighted-wrist session equaled the weight of the tool. If \nfatigue or repeated testing affects arm kinematics, this would be captured by this control session.\nCognitive and proprioceptive assessment. We assessed participants global cognitive function by administering \nthe Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)  test\n22. The mean score value was 27.5, ranging from 24 to 30, thus \nhighlighting no cognitive impairment in any of our old adult participants. In addition, a selection of five sub-\ntests of the Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance (RASP) 23 was used to exclude any obvious \nsomatosensory impairment. The mean score value was 98.3%, ranging from 87.5 to 100% of correct answers, \nconfirming the absence of pathological impairment.\nFurther, we assessed online and offline proprioception through the joint position matching task  performed \nin remembered and concurrent  tasks\n24. As there is no standardized scale, or cut-off to define proprioceptive \nimpairment, we additionally enrolled and tested both offline and online proprioception in a group of 20 young \nhealthy adults (ten males and ten females, mean age = 25.4 ± 3.2, range 21–35). Y oung participants completed the \nproprioceptive assessment only. This allowed us to assess whether our old participants’ population was indeed \nimpaired as compared to young participants. They also provided written informed consent prior taking part in \nthe study, which was approved by the French ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est \nIV), and all experimental procedures conformed to the Helsinki declaration.\nWe used a custom made apparatus similar to the one of Allen et al.\n25. In this setup, participants are blindfolded \nand their forearms are strapped to lightweight paddles aligned with the elbow joint. An inclinometer attached to \neach paddle directly displayed the value of the angular flexion of the elbow (precision value  = 0.1°).\nIn the ipsilateral remembered matching task, an experimenter raised the paddle supporting the participant’s \nforearm to a target angle (20° or 40° elbow flexion from the initial position) in the sagittal plane, maintained \nthis position for 5 s as assessed by a stopwatch, and returned the arm to its initial position. The participant was \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17275  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74455-5\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nthen required to reproduce the position with the same forearm, with the use of proprioceptive memory. The \nexperimenter maintained a steady pace for each trial. This task was done similarly for both arms: Ipsilateral \nRemembered Right (IRR) and Ipsilateral Remembered Left (IRL).\nIn the Contralateral Concurrent Matching task (CCM), a similar procedure was undertaken involving the \npassive displacement of the right forearm to a target angle (as before 20° and 40° elbow flexion from the initial \nposition). In this task, the dominant forearm was set and maintained in the target position while the participant \nperformed the matching with his/her non-dominant forearm.\nIn all tasks alike, each target angle was administered 6 times in a randomized order for a total of 12 trials per \ntask. We used the absolute matching error value, as a measurement of proprioceptive acuity to compare both \n groups\n16. For the three tasks, the absolute error value on every trial was computed as the unsigned difference \nbetween the reproduced/matched angular position and the reference one (20°/40°). The error values units were \nin angular degrees.\nTool‑use and weighted‑wrist sessions. The two sessions each consisted in three phases: a pre- and post-phase \nseparated by a tool-use or a weighted-wrist phase, all performed in a dimly illuminated and sound-attenuated \nroom. Participants were comfortably seated in front of a table, on an adjustable chair, their dominant hand \nclosed in a pinch-shaped grip on a starting switch. They had to reach and grasp a wooden block (10 × 2.5 × 5 cm, \nweighing 96 g) placed on the table at a distance of 35 cm along the sagittal axis, in line with participants’ right \nshoulder (or left shoulder for left-handed participants). Importantly, as in previous studies using the same \n paradigm\n4,6,13,26,27, the object was always located inside the arm’s reaching space, thus preventing potential con-\nfounding effects of tool-use on space representation.\nPre and post phases. In the pre and post phases, participants performed two tasks: a free-hand reach-\nto-grasp task and a forearm length estimation task. While the former informs about unconscious changes \nin arm body estimate via kinematics, the latter informs about subjective, conscious changes in arm length \n representation\n13. Free-hand reaching movements and forearm estimation tasks were proposed in a counterbal-\nanced order across participants (Fig. 1).\nIn the free-hand reach-to-grasp task, participants had to reach, grasp, and lift the object with their dominant \nhand for 18 trials. At the beginning of a trial, participants were asked to keep their dominant hand in the starting \npinch-grip position, i.e. the tips of the thumb and the index in contact, pressing down the starting switch located \nin the proximal edge of the table, facing the object. After a random delay (ranging between 1 and 2 s), an audi -\ntory ‘go’ signal was produced and subjects had to reach, grasp and then raise the object keeping it between their \nthumb and index fingers. Then they had to put the object back on the table and return to their starting position.\nIn the forearm length estimation task (18 trials), blindfolded participants were asked to estimate the length \nof their dominant forearm from the elbow to the wrist. To that aim, starting from the switch, upon the auditory \n‘go’ signal they had to slide their dominant index finger horizontally on the table (following a fronto-parallel \naxis) for a distance corresponding to the estimation of their forearm length.\nTo remind participants of the forearm distance to reproduce, the experimenter named and delivered a tactile \nstimulation on her dominant wrist and elbow before the first trial. Once a trial performed, participants had to \nreturn to the starting position and wait to perform the next trial.\nTool‑use phase. The tool-use phase consisted of four blocks of 12 reach-to-grasp movements using a tool \n(48 trials). Participants were instructed to place the tips of the tool prongs (pinch grip) on the starting switch at \nFigure 1.  Within subject design run over two consecutive days: the first day consisted of cognitive and \nproprioceptive assessments followed by either a tool-use session or a weighted-wrist session. Curved blue arrows \nindicate the counterbalancing of session (tool-use and weighted-wrist) and the counterbalancing of pre-post \ntasks (free-hand reach-to-grasp movements and forearm length estimation) between subjects.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17275  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74455-5\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nthe beginning of each trial and wait for an acoustic go signal to reach and grasp the object using the tool. The tool \nwas the same used in several previous studies and consisted in an ergonomic handle (10 cm-long), a 30 cm-long \nrigid shaft and an articulated “hand” composed by two curved prongs with rubber allowing a stable grasp. The \ntool was controlled by squeezing the handle with the whole hand: closing the hand would close the tip of the \nprongs while opening the hand would release the grip (Fig.  2). Participants were not allowed to train with the \ntool, and had never used it or seen it before the trial day.\nWeighted‑wrist phase. In the weighted-wrist phase, participants had to reach and grasp for the same \nobject with their dominant hand equipped with a weight wrapped around the wrist. This task also consisted of \nfour blocks of 12 trials each. The weight was a commercial gym wrist weight modified to equate the tool weight \n(300 g). As in the previous tasks, participants maintained a pinch grip position on the starting switch and waited \nfor the acoustic go signal.\nKinematic recordings and analysis. Three infrared light emitting diodes were taped on kinematic rel-\nevant locations on participant’s dominant hand, namely on the thumb (inside corner of the fingernail), index \nfinger (external corner of the nail), and wrist (the skin proximal to the styloid process of the radius). The reach-\ning component of the movement was characterized by the kinematic parameters of the wrist marker, while the \ngrip component was characterized by the distance between the thumb and index. Three additional markers were \nplaced on the tool in a similar functional arrangement: two on the extremities of the mechanical “fingers” and \none in the distal part of the shaft “wrist” . Spatial positions of the markers were recorded with an Optotrak system \n(Optotrak 3020, Northern Digital Inc) placed perpendicularly over the table, with a sampling rate of 200 Hz \n(0.01 mm 3D resolution at 2.25 m distance). Kinematics analysis of 3D movements were performed offline to \nobtain for each trial the amplitude and latency of four parameters: the peaks of wrist acceleration, velocity and \ndeceleration (transport component), as well as for the peak of grip aperture (grip component). In addition, we \nmeasured the duration of the movement.\nStatistics. Proprioception. A repeated measure ANOV A was done with Group (Y oung/Old adults) as a \nbetween subject factor, and proprioceptive test Task (IRR/IRL/CCM) and Angle (20°/40°) as a within subject \nfactor in order to compare the proprioceptive acuity between young and old adults.\nKinematics. To account for the interdependency of the kinematics parameters and movement components, \na full factorial design permutation analysis was applied to free-hand movements, using the flip package on \n R\n28,29. The factors were Session (Tool-use and Weighted-wrist) and Time (Pre- vs Post-) and their interaction to \nevaluate the impact of tool-use on the kinematics of movements performed before and after tool-use. Similar \nanalyses were performed with the factors Session (Tool-use and Weighted-wrist) and Block (1st/4th) to evalu-\nate potential learning effects of tool-use practicing. Importantly, the permutation analysis was designed for a \nmultivariate framework. This allows to combine the significance of the kinematic parameters for the transport \nphase (amplitudes and latencies of peaks the wrist acceleration, velocity and deceleration) and those for the \ngrasping phase (amplitudes and latencies of the grip aperture), to obtain one global p-value for each component. \nThe global p-value is obtained via Nonparametric Combination  (NPC\n30) of partial p-values testing the single \nparameters. In keeping with previous work on the same paradigm and  factors5,13, this methodology accounts for \ndependence among tests through a nonparametric approach based on the joint (i.e. multivariate) permutation \n distribution28,29.\nFigure 2.  Final grasping position of a free-hand (A) and tool-use (B) reach-to-grasp movement. The tool \nconsisted in an ergonomic handle (10 cm-long), a 30 cm-long rigid shaft and an articulated “hand” composed \nby two curved prongs.\n5\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17275  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74455-5\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nLength estimation. Because the forearm length estimation task involved only one parameter, a repeated meas-\nure ANOV A was performed on these data, with factors Session (Tool-use; Weighted-wrist) and Time (Pre- vs \nPost-session).\nCorrelations. Finally, for old participants, we performed Pearson correlations analysis between the propriocep-\ntive tests and the delta of the kinematic changes between pre and post tool-use. The rational for this approach \nwas to identify whether proprioceptive acuity might be linked to the ability to incorporate the tool, as assessed \nthrough kinematic changes after tool-use session.\nResults\nOnline proprioception is spared in old adults. First, we compared the proprioceptive acuity between \nyoung and old adults to ascertain whether our sample of old adults displayed the expected decline in the offline \n(IRR/IRL) as compared to online proprioception (CCM). Noteworthy, all participants overshot the reproduced \nor matched target position compared to the initial reference position. The repeated measures ANOV A performed \non the proprioceptive assessment revealed a significant interaction between Group and proprioceptive Task \n(F(1,37) = 3.575, p < 0.033). Post hoc t-tests confirmed the expected significant difference between groups for the \nIRR and IRL Task (IRR error for old adults = 5.34° vs for young adults = 3.18°, p < 0.001; IRL for old adults = 5.62° \nvs for young adults = 3.37°, p < 0.001) and the non-significant difference for the CCM Task (CCM error for old \nadults = 6.28° vs for young adults = 5.34°, p > 0.19). This pattern of results confirms the findings reported in the \nliterature on  presbypropria\n15, an alteration of older adult’s proprioception, affecting mostly the offline access to \nproprioceptive  information17. Noteworthy, no significant difference was found when assessing the dominant \nvs non-dominant hand concerning the IR tasks (IR for dominant hand error = 5.57° vs for non‑dominant hand \nerror = 5.39°, p = 0.49) in old adults.\nTool‑use changes movements kinematics. The full factorial design permutation analysis revealed that \nthe factors Session (Tool-use and Weighted-wrist) and Time (Pre- vs Post-session) interacted significantly for \nthe transport component (Fisher combination; K = 29.84, p = 0.0007) and the grip component (K = 5.95, p < 0.03). \nThe combined p-value assessed for the tool-use session confirmed an effect of Time on the transport (K = 31.16, \np < 0.0004) and grip component (K = 8.14, p < 0.0058). Figure  3 shows permutations analysis performed on \neach parameter, which highlighted a decreased acceleration (t = − 2.11, p < 0.04) and a delayed velocity (t = 4.46, \np < 0.0001) and deceleration (t = 4.08, p < 0.0001) peaks, as well as a trend to a delayed acceleration peak and \ndecreased velocity and deceleration peaks (p values  < 0.068, 0.069, 0.057 respectively) after the use of the tool. \nIn addition, the latency of the maximum grip aperture (pre = 622.65 ms vs post = 707.43 ms; t = 3.76, p < 0.0005), \nas well as the movement duration (pre = 922.96 ms vs post = 1036.68 ms; t = 3.43, p < 0.0008), were longer after \nthe tool-use session. In sharp contrast, the analyses performed for the weighted-wrist control session yielded no \nsignificant effect of Time either on the Transport component, or on the Grip component (both p >  = 0.1).\nThe forearm length estimation, as assessed via the explicit length reproduction task, was not affected by the \nfactors Session (Tool‑use and Weighted‑wrist, F(1,19) = 0.002, p = 0.961) and Time (Pre‑ vs Post‑, F(1,19) = 0.908, \np = 353), nor by their interactions (average pre‑tool session = 105.48% vs average post‑tool session = 108.77% and \naverage pre‑weight session = 106.45 vs average post‑weight session = 108.76%, F(1,19) = 0.151, p = 0.702).\nFigure 3.

The full factorial design permuta-\ntion analysis with factors Block (1st/4th) * Session (Tool-use and Weighted-wrist) revealed neither significant \nmain effects nor interaction on the transport component (Fisher combination; K = 7.15, p < 0.28) or the grip \ncomponent (K = 3.46, p < 0.15), ruling out any gross learning effect during sessions for this component. The grip \ncomponent was affected during the use of the tool (k = 5.11, p < 0.02), as the maximum grip aperture decreased \nsignificantly from the first to the fourth block of trials (pre = 114.58 mm vs post = 106.71 mm; t = -2.69; p < 0.006).\nOnline proprioceptive acuity is correlated with kinematic changes. To examine the potential \nlink between proprioception acuity and the pattern of kinematic modifications observed after tool-use, we per-\nformed in our old population a series of Pearson correlations between the absolute errors participants made in \nthe proprioceptive tests and the kinematic changes after tool-use (post–pre difference for each parameter). There \nwas a highly significant correlation between the online proprioceptive acuity, as measured by the CCM task, \nand the difference between post minus pre tool-use on most of the kinematic parameters: acceleration: r = 0.802 \n, p < 0.001; velocity: r = 0.769, p < 0.00012; deceleration: r = 0.766, p < 0.00013; latency of velocity: r = − 0.707, \np < 0.00071; latency of deceleration: r = − 0.665, p < 0.0019; movement time: r = − 0.770, p < 0.00012; latency of \nmaximum grip aperture: r = − 0.742, p < 0.00065 (all p values are Bonferroni corrected). As shown in Fig.  4, the \nbetter acuity in online proprioception, the larger the changes in kinematics parameters after tool-use. In striking \ncontrast, there was no significant correlation between offline proprioceptive Task (IRR and IRL) and the pattern \nof kinematic changes after tool-use (all p-values > 0.12).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we sought to disentangle whether online or offline access to proprioception updates the \nbody estimate for movement execution following tool-use. To this aim, we first identified a group of ‘old’ healthy \nadults (60 year-old) showing declined offline, but preserved online proprioception. We then assessed them for \nthe emergence of the pattern of kinematic changes that has been previously reported following tool-use in young \nadults (average 25 years-old in 7 previous studies). The results showed that relatively old participants display \nthe typical (i.e., previously reported in young adults) kinematic signature of tool incorporation. After tool-use, \nthe kinematics of their free-hand reaching movement’s changes, showing delayed latencies and lowered peaks \namplitudes. This finding extends to the beginning of the old age the notion that tool-use modifies the unconscious \nestimate of the bodily effector used to control motor actions. Instead, tool-use does not modify the conscious \nperception of old peoples’ body, again in keeping with what known from the young  population\n13. Most impor-\ntantly, we found that online (but not offline) proprioceptive acuity correlated with the amount of the kinematics \nchanges observed after tool-use, thus establishing for the first time a tight link between tool-use incorporation \nand real-time proprioceptive body state estimate. Altogether, these findings point to the prominent role played \nby online proprioception in updating the body estimate for the motor control of tools in old participants.\nPrevious work on the assessment of proprioception acuity mainly relied on tasks that vary in terms of either \nmemory requirements (offline) or interhemispheric transfer (online)\n17. Our findings confirm the presence of \na specific offline impairment in the old adult population, indexed by the ipsilateral matching task, as well as a \nFigure 4.

The pres-\nence (and the nature) of proprioceptive decline with age is still debated, as is its potential contribution to motor \n control\n31. Its presence may vary depending on what variables are measured and which tasks are used, as is typi-\ncally not observed when assessed by visual to proprioceptive matching  tasks32. Y et, proprioceptive decline with \nage has been consistently reported when testing proprioceptive memory: the pattern we report here conforms \nto previous findings on the decline of the offline component of proprioception in healthy  ageing\n15,17,32. By using \nthe same offline/online testing procedures employed by Adamo et al. 17, here we actually extend their results to \nthe very beginning of the old age. While Adamo et al. ’s study observed significant decline in offline propriocep-\ntion in adults aged 75/76 on  average17,33, here we report that significant decline in offline proprioception can be \ndetected in adults aged 60 on average.\nMost interesting for the scope of our study, following tool-use, old participants exhibited the typical kin-\nematic signatures so far reported in young adults only. After tool-use, free hand reaching movements displayed \nprotracted and lowered transport component parameters (three out of six parameters were significantly altered). \nImportantly, and also in line with previous work, these effects emerged specifically following tool-use. The \nweighted-wrist control session did not trigger any of such effects on movement’s kinematics. These tool specific \nkinematic modifications have been interpreted as a kinematic signature of tool incorporation in the effector \nrepresentation, which would be represented as longer after tool-use\n6,11. Indeed, similar kinematics characteristics \n(longer latencies, reduced amplitudes) are also observable in participants having a naturally longer arm when \ncompared to shorter-armed participants’  movements\n6,13. Finally, tool-use did not influence the conscious arm \nrepresentation of old adults, as evaluated through the forearm length estimation task, as it was not affected by \ntool-use. Here, we further confirm that the explicit, verbal and conscious representation of the body, referred as \nthe Body  Image\n34,35, is immune to factors affecting the body representation for  action13,27. In agreement with our \npredictions, these findings clearly indicate that offline proprioception is not crucial to motor control plasticity \nfollowing tool-use. Would that be the case, we should expect old participants with impaired offline propriocep-\ntion not to display significant changes in their movement kinematics, or displaying changes that differ from the \npattern repeatedly reported in young adults. Instead, their presence and the fact that both peak amplitudes and \nlatencies were qualitatively affected in the same directions as in the young population, suggest that preserved \nonline proprioception plays a critical role in updating our body state estimate.\nAmong the first conceptualizations of unconscious body representations devoted to action control, originally \ncalled body schema, stemmed from neuropsychological observations of patients with various somatosensory \n diseases\n36. Since then, proprioception has been considered among the main inputs feeding this implicit body \n representation37–40. In previous work, we reported that proprioceptive deafferentation may still allow fairly \naccurate touch localization on a  tool41, but prevents tool-use from affecting the subsequent  kinematics14. This \ninability to incorporate a tool at motor level, at odds with what typically shown by young and now old healthy \nparticipants, attests to the crucial role of proprioceptive inputs in building an updated representation of the motor \neffector. Martel and  coworkers\n13, by observing the same kinematic signature of tool incorporation in healthy \nblindfolded participants, further showed that proprioception is not only necessary, but also sufficient to trigger \ntool incorporation. The present results allow to step further and reveal the correlation existing between online \nproprioceptive acuity and the kinematics signature of the tool incorporation: the better proprioceptive acuity, \nthe larger the extent of kinematic changes following tool-use. While these findings are in keeping with the role of \nproprioception in updating body  representation\n37,42,43, they concur in indicating this body representation feeds \ninternal models of motor  control1,13,14. Our findings refine current models by suggesting that the state estima -\ntion of the body relies heavily on online proprioceptive inputs to monitor and update the represented metric of \neffectors. While the neural correlates of this update remain to be elucidated, the sensorimotor regions, as well as \nmore posterior parietal cortices, could be likely candidates. Previous neuroimaging work indeed pointed to the \nintraparietal sulcus and the premotor cortex as neural correlate of the body estimate, and have more recently \nunderlined the role of the somatosensory cortices in the coding of  proprioception\n44,45 and position  sense46,47.\nHere we report for the first time that having used a tool that lengthens participants’ arm affects the arm length \nrepresentation in the old population. The presence of these plastic changes in old adults is in keeping with the \nsuggestion that motor control may remain relatively preserved with age, as long as it concerns relatively simple \nmovements (see, for  review\n48). Noteworthy, when comparing the kinematics during the tool-use sessions across \nblocks, we did not observe evidence of tool learning on the transport component. Transport parameters were \ncomparable between the first and last blocks of trials. Importantly, this absence of gross learning effects has also \nbeen reported in previous  studies\n4,6,13,26. Here however, one kinematic parameter displayed signs of tool learn -\ning, namely the tool grip aperture, whose maximum was reduced in the last compared to the first block of trials. \nThis effect is compatible with a reduced safety  margin\n49 while grasping the object as participants got used to \nthe tool. Importantly though, after tool-use the hand maximum grip aperture did not differ from that observed \nbefore tool-use. Thus, the plastic mechanisms of tool incorporation that affect the transport component are likely \nindependent from the processes of learning to control the tool grip aperture during tool-use.\nTo conclude, here we show that 60 years-old participants display plastic changes in movement kinematics of \ntheir arm following tool-use, akin to those known in young adults. As suggested  elsewhere\n13,14 these changes may \nreflect the update of ‘state of affairs’ of the body, in particular of the effector used. Our findings clearly indicate \nthat in old participants, the online readout of proprioceptive information provides a major contribution to this \nupdate. In addition, online proprioceptive acuity predicts the extent to which tool-use will impact subsequent \nfreehand kinematics, corroborating the notion that tool incorporation relies heavily on ongoing processing of \nposition sense.\n8\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17275  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74455-5\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nReceived: 8 July 2020; Accepted: 28 September 2020\nReferences\n 1.
