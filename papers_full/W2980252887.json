It is known to\nbe high-cost component and has a direct effect on network\noperation, location, oil contents and toxic material where\nany interruption on the transformer would reduce the reli-\nability of the power system [2]–[4].

TRANSFORMER INSULATING OIL – HISTORICAL\nBACKGROUND\nDuring the 1870s and 1990s, petroleum based oils have been\nused as dielectric liquids in transformer system [6]. They pro-\nvided superior insulation, which served the purpose as dielec-\ntric liquids and excellent heat transfer medium to remove heat\ngenerated by electrical losses. However, the downside is that\nparafﬁnic-based oils, in general, have high pour points due to\nits high parafﬁn wax content, which is unacceptable for use in\npower-distributing equipment exposed to low temperatures.\nFurthermore, the sludge that is build-up due to oxidation is\ninsoluble in such oils, increasing its viscosity. High-viscosity\noils reduced heat transfer capabilities, which lead to overheat-\ning and reduced shelf life.\nNaphthenic-based transformer oil was later introduced\nto combat the mentioned challenges. Although naphthenic-\nbased oils are more vulnerable in oxidation compared to\nparafﬁnic-based, the oxidized products are soluble that,\nresulted in reduction in viscosity [7]. Naphthenic-based\noils have a lower pour point, which will remain ﬂuid\nat low temperature in the transformer system. However,\nthe concern when utilizing naphthenic-based transformer\noil is its ﬂammability. Askarels – synthetic chlorinated\naromatic hydrocarbons were used as insulating oils to\nenhance the ﬁre resistance. The ﬁrst transformer to utilized\naskarel was in 1932 and continued until the 1970s where\nit was determined that they were no longer environmentally\nacceptable [8].\nLater, silicone ﬂuids were introduced as an alternative\nto chlorine-based oils later as it has excellent electrical\ninsulating, anti-oxidative properties, higher ﬁre point, low\nﬂammable ﬂuids and exceptional thermal stability due to\nthe high Si-O bonding energy [6]. It was utilized for more\nthan 20 years but the information was insufﬁcient to evalu-\nate its insulation and diagnosis when compared to data for\ntransformer system that relies on mineral oil [9]. Another\nalternative was introduced that paired with silicone ﬂuids\nwhich are high temperature hydrocarbons (HTH). They pos-\nsess good electrical insulation but are ﬂammable with high\nﬁre points [6].\nChloroﬂuorocarbon-based ﬂuids were commercially uti-\nlized that demonstrated good electrical insulation and are\nnon-ﬂammable. However, its boiling point is low and tends\nto vaporize at operating temperatures. Tetrachloroethylene-\nbased ﬂuids are non-ﬂammable which was commercially\nintroduced in 1980 under the tradename WECOSOL [10].\nThe ﬂuid has low viscosity and showcased excellent heat\ndissipation trait. It was used alone or mixed with trans-\nformer mineral oil to improve lubricating properties at a lower\ncost [11]. However, it has relatively lower electrical insulation\nproperties compared to mineral oil and compromised safe\noperations. In 1978, isopropyl biphenyl hydrocarbon ﬂuids,\ncomposed of propylated biphenyl isomers, were used for\nelectric insulation. It has a good electrical insulating property\nand its ﬂammability was reported to be relatively lower than\nFIGURE 1. Timeline of different transformer oils and their development.\nthe other commercialized ﬂuids. The development of differ-\nent transformer oils and evolution shown in Fig.1.\nDifferent types of transformer oils in a different era is\nhighlighted and their properties are also clearly mentioned\nin Table 1. Among all the different oils, silicone oil, high\ntemperature hydrocarbons (HTH), chloroﬂuorocarbon-based\nﬂuids, and isopropyl-biphenyl hydrocarbon ﬂuids show good\nelectrical insulating properties. In addition, silicone oil also\nexhibits excellent thermal stability but still, the properties are\nnot satisfactory.\nB. TRANSFORMER – GENERAL DESIGN, OPERATING\nCONDITION AND CAUSES OF FAILURES\nTransformers are normally found in industries that generate\nelectricity, containing large numbers in various sizes from\nfew kV A to over a few hundred MV A capacities [12]. Such\nvital electrical component is reliable in continuous operations\nthat last 30 to 40 years of design life – some would go\nover 50 years [13]–[15]. In general, transformers contain\nfew components – the main active component would be the\nwinding and core that are responsible to alter voltages. Other\ncomponents include load tap changer, bushing, insulation (oil\nand paper) and tank. Some heavy-duty transformers rely on\noil to insulate high voltages and to dissipate heat. It consists\nof copper coils and a steel core linking them and is immersed\nin a transformer oil contained in the body tank.\nAccording to Delta Transformers Inc, during the trans-\nformer operating, the maximum temperature rise attained was\n65 ◦C and combined with the maximum ambient temper-\nature of 40 ◦C, the operating temperature can lead up to\n220 ◦C [16]. Its enclosure surface and hotspot in the trans-\nformer system could rise to 105 ◦C and 180 ◦C, respectively,\nat full load. High temperatures could stress the transformer\nsystem, leading to failure in operations. Fig 2below displays\nstatistics of transformer failure between 2009 and 2013 in\nIndia. Different categories were analyzed over a period and\nfailures for each category was reported clearly. Moreover,\nout of all Insulation shows a maximum of 80 failures, tank\nand coolant shows a minimum number of failures 6 and 9.\nOn the other hand, it was reported that bushing and other sec-\nondary causes such as cooling are both responsible for 20%\nfor transformer failure, which can be viewed in Fig 3. The\nbushing is an insulating component used in the transformer to\nallow high voltages safely ﬂow through the grounded barrier.\nSince high voltages pass through, this insulating component\nVOLUME 7, 2019 151423\nD.

Types of transformer fluids used in respective years.\ndeals with heat and requires transformer oil to cool it down.\nIf the transformer oil could not dissipate heat, the bushing\nof the transformer will eventually fail. One of the reasons\nFIGURE 2. Statistics of transformer failure between 2009 and 2013 in\nIndia [18].\nFIGURE 3. (a) Causes of transformer failure and (b) bushing failure [1].\nthat led to bushing failure was overheating or hotspots, which\ncovered the highest of 32%. According to e-Cigre [17],\nbetween 2004 and 2009, dielectric and thermal were noted as\ntwo of the root causes of transformer, which can be viewed\nin Fig 4.\nRegardless of the type, transformer oils should possess\nreliable characteristics to ensure optimum and safe contin-\nuous operations. Two of the characteristics that should be\nheavily emphasized is its insulation and coolant. Transformer\noil should have high dielectric strength to withstand high volt-\nages generated by the transformer without breaking down.\nBesides, it should also possess high thermal conductivity for\nheat dissipation – relieve or cool down the system. Table 2\nbelow summarizes characteristics of reliable transformer oil\nshould have.\n151424 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD.

Characteristics of reliable transformer oil [8].\nII. TYPES OF TRANSFORMER OIL: MINERAL,\nVEGETABLE OR BLEND OIL\nOver the years, different types of transformer oil have been\nstudied to overcome the current challenges faced by power\ntransmission systems. Apart from mineral oil, vegetable oils\nhave been also investigated in detail. Vegetable oils are\noriginated from plants and they usually referred to as plant\noil. Vegetable oils are renewable, cheap, environmentally\nfriendly, biodegradable and safer alternative insulating oil.\nUnlike mineral oil, they don’t generate a poisonous substance\nfrom oxidative instability [19]. Many researchers investigated\nvegetable oils as a potential substitute for mineral oils while\nother researchers investigated mixtures or blend oils.\nTill date, mineral oil is still extensively used as transformer\noil as it is stable at high temperatures and easy to acquire since\nit is derived from crude oil. Silicone oils and synthetic esters\nwere utilized as transformer oil but stopped as it deprived in\nsafe operation and usage [6]. Table 3summarizes the compar-\nison between mineral oil, silicone oil, synthetic ester and veg-\netable oil. Insulation and coolant are two of the crucial traits\nof transformer oil to ensure reliable transformer operations.\nThermal conductivity is one of the key properties to evaluate\nTABLE 3. Insulating properties of various types of transformer\noil [19], [20].\nheat dissipation of transformer oil that makes the product\neven better. Higher thermal conductivity ensures more heat\nto be transferred. Comparing the four types of transformer\noil in table 3, vegetable oil, in general, has the highest\nthermal conductivity, ranging from 0.16 to 0.17 W/m.K.\nDielectric constant and breakdown voltage are two of the\nproperties to evaluate insulation of the transformer oil. Based\non table 3, it can be seen vegetable oil has higher breakdown\nvoltage and dielectric constant, ranging from 82 to 97 kV\nand 3.1, respectively. In other words, vegetable oils can resist\nVOLUME 7, 2019 151425\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nhigher voltage before it breaks down and able to partially be\nconducted. However, the drawback of vegetable oil is that it\nhas high moisture content and prone to oxidation. Mineral\nand silicone oils have low moisture content and have a higher\nresistance to oxidation. Comparing its shelf life, mineral and\nsilicone oils can sustain longer than vegetable oils.\nVillarroelet al. [22] studied moisture diffusion coefﬁcients\nof transformer pressboard insulation and compared two veg-\netable oils Bio Electra TM and Bio Temp TM that were derived\nfrom sunﬂower seeds. The general equation for moisture dif-\nfusion coefﬁcients was determined that covered a wide range\nof temperatures, moisture concentration and insulation thick-\nness. The equations of Bio Electra TM and Bio Temp TM were\nfound and expected to be similar since both natural esters\nderived from sunﬂower seeds. Achmad Susilo et al. [23]\ninvestigated partial discharge characteristics and dissolved\ngas analysis of two types of fatty acid alkyl esters – Pastell\n2H-08 and palm fatty acid ester (PFAE) and compared with\nmineral oil. It was reported that partial discharge of Pastell\n2H-08 increased above 15 kV rms than that of mineral oil\ndue to higher dissipation factor. The dissolved gas analysis\nconﬁrmed that Pastell 2H-08 generated a higher amount of\nhydrocarbon gases than mineral oil. Yanuar Z. Arief et al. [24]\ncompared two vegetable oils – palm fatty acid ester (PFAE)\nand FR3 with mineral oil. It was reported that PFAE resulted\nin the highest breakdown voltage of 48.92 kV . PFAE and\nFR3 have lower dissipation factor than mineral oil. How-\never, three oils resulted in the same trend where dissipation\nfactor increased as ageing time increased. Lastly, PFAE and\nFR3 have higher capacitance than the one in mineral oil.\nHigh capacitance indicates good insulation where the tan δ\nis low since it is inversely proportional. Low value of capac-\nitance indicates the insulating oil is approaching electrical\nconduction [24]. Additionally, AC conduction analysis was\ncarried out on computational simulation to evaluate dielec-\ntric characteristics with different vegetable oils – coconut\noil and sunﬂower oil. From the simulation, it was found\nthat coconut oil has a relatively higher dielectric strength.\nHowever, the dielectric strengths of all oils decreased as the\nelectrode gap increases. Table 4shows the comparison of\nproperties with mineral oil and studied vegetable oils.\nIn recent studies, Toudja et al. [25] reported mixtures of\nnatural ester olive oil and naphthenic mineral oil. The mixture\nratios were covered from pure mineral oil to 50% mineral\nand 50% olive oil to pure olive oil. Hiramatsu et al. [26]\nstudied the effect of water on breakdown properties of\nEnvirotemp FR3, which is derived from soybean oil, and\nmineral oil mixtures. Mineral oil was mixed into Envi-\nrotemp FR3 with weight percentage ranging from 0 to 20.\nYu et al. [27] studied the breakdown voltage of mineral oil\nand Envirotemp FR3 mixtures ranging from 0% mineral oil\nand 100% Envirotemp FR3 to 100% mineral oil and 0%\nEnvirotemp FR3. Table 5 summarizes the ﬁndings of the\nreported blend oil mixtures with its outcomes.\nLi et al. [28] reported thermal ageing of 20 vol% rapeseed\noil and 80 vol% mineral oil mixtures. Dielectric loss of the\nTABLE 4. Summary of recent research on vegetable oil as transformer oil.\nstudied mixtures was found to be slightly lesser compared to\none in pure mineral oil after 50 days of thermal aging. The\nbreakdown voltage of the oils decreased with ageing time\nbut mixture of 80 vol% mineral oil and 20 vol% rapeseed oil\nresulted higher compared to pure mineral oil when the ageing\ntime was higher than 50 days. Johari et al. [29] compared\nbreakdown voltage of palm fatty acid ester (PFAE) with\nsoybean-based Envirotemp FR3 (FR3). Breakdown voltage\nof both biodegradable oils decreased with ageing period.\nHowever, PFAE resulted higher breakdown voltage than FR3\n151426 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nTABLE 5. Summary of results on blend oils.\nby up to 7.14%. Viscosity of PFAE and FR3 increased after\n200 hours of ageing period by up to 34.25% and 10.38%,\nrespectively. Guerbas et al. [30] studied mineral oil and\nreclaimed used mineral oil, obtained from the Algerian trans-\nformer. Both oils resulted improved breakdown voltage after\n315 hour of ageing period. However, the breakdown voltage\nof reclaimed oil decreased slightly until 531-hour ageing\nperiod while decreased drastically for the new mineral oil.\nIt can be seen vegetable oils have relatively higher break-\ndown voltage than mineral oil. Having a high breakdown\nvoltage allows the transformer oil to resist higher voltages\nin the transformer system before it breaks and become semi-\nconductive. However, two of the factors were studied that\nweaken the breakdown voltage of the transformer oil – water\ncontent and aging. Vegetable oils contain ester groups which\ncould form hydrogen bonded water, depleting the break-\ndown voltage [27], [28]. Naturally, mineral oils do not con-\ntain ester groups and they have signiﬁcantly lower water\ncontent, compared to vegetable oils. Aging, on the other\nhand, depletes breakdown voltage since the oils degrade over\ntime. Both oils degrade due to oxidation forming oxidized\nproducts. Vegetable oils are prone to oxidation and degrade\nfaster compared to mineral oil. Its oxidation products tend\nto be more acidic compared to mineral oils, which acceler-\nates the aging rate [27]. Water content and acidity must be\ncontrolled to limit or slow down the aging and degradation\nprocesses to ensure longer shelf life. However, casting off\nvegetable oil should not be the option as it provides higher\nbreakdown voltage than one in mineral oils. Vegetable oils\nFIGURE 5. Preparation of nanofluids by a two-step method.\ncontain triglycerides fats (saturated fat) which have orienta-\ntion, atomic and electronic polarizations, resulting in higher\nbreakdown voltage whereas mineral oil contains non-polar\nalkane chain molecules [33].\nIII. PREPARATION OF TRANSFORMER OIL NANOFLUID\nPreparation of transformer oil based nanoﬂuid primarily\nrequires careful selection of nanoparticles with superior prop-\nerties that helps to improve the thermal and dielectric proper-\nties of transformer oils. These nanoparticles are categorized\ninto different groups based on their behavior and function\nsuch as conducting, semiconducting and insulating nanopar-\nticles that are dispersed in transformer oil. The synthesis of\nnanoﬂuids involves two methods 1) One-step method and\n2) Two-step method.\nIn the one-step method, the making and dispersion of\nnanoparticles in a base ﬂuid is simultaneously done through\nphysical vapor condensation processes [34]. This method\nmay not be cost effective and drying, transportation and\nnanoparticle dispersion are avoided that results in minimizing\nnanoparticle agglomeration. Furthermore, the uniform dis-\ntribution of nanoparticles can be beneﬁted when one-step\nmethod is utilized. The disadvantages for one-step method\nis the residual reactants that are left in the nanoﬂuids due to\nincomplete reaction and stabilization [34]. The other disad-\nvantage of using one-step method is determining the effect\nof nanoparticle without eliminating the impurities and large-\nscale production is very expensive. Furthermore, in one-step\nmethod, most of the nanoﬂuids synthesized were metal-based\nnanoparticles such as copper, silver and tungsten [34].\nOn the other hand, two-step method initially involves\npreparing the dry-powdered nanoparticles by means of chem-\nical or physical methods. Later, the powdered nanoparticles\nare dispersed into the base ﬂuid with the aid of agitation\nsuch as ultrasonic or magnetic stirring (shown in Fig 5). Even\nthough the process is longer, it is more economical to produce\nnanoﬂuid, especially in large-scale applications.\nSeveral researchers have reported that the use of dif-\nferent nanoparticles in base oils enhances the dielec-\ntric, heat transfer and insulation properties. For example,\nFe3O4-transformer oil (mineral oil) nanoﬂuids with nanopar-\nticle concentration up to 0.02 vol% were synthesized by\ntwo-step method and have resulted in enhanced breakdown\nstrength [35]. Another two-step method was utilized to syn-\nthesize TiO2 nanoﬂuids and resulted in improved breakdown\nVOLUME 7, 2019 151427\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nTABLE 6. Methods used to synthesize transformer oil nanofluids.\nstrength with 0.00625 vol% nanoparticle concentration [36].\nChoi et al. [37] synthesized Al 2O3-transformer oil with\nnanoparticle loading of up to 4 vol%. Alicia et al. [38] synthe-\nsized graphene-transformer oil nanoﬂuids with nanoparticle\nconcentration ranging from 0.01 and 0.1 wt.%. However,\nAberoumand and Jafarimoghaddam [39] utilized a one-\nstep method to synthesize hybrid WO 3-Ag-transformer oil.\nTable 6 displays the various transformer oil nanoﬂuids\nrecently studied using one step and two-step methods.\nFIGURE 6. Pictorial representation of different forces acting on\nnanoparticles that leads to sedimentation and aggregation when\ndispersed in transformer oil.\nA. STABILITY OF TRANSFORMER NANOFLUIDS\nStability is one of the key parameters that ensures the con-\nsistency of the functioning nanoﬂuid and longer life cycle.\nEnsuring the long-life cycle of nanoﬂuid possesses a chal-\nlenge due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles. This aggre-\ngation is might be due to van der Waals forces of attraction\nor electrostatic repulsive forces lead to agglomeration of\nnanoparticles that limit the application shown in Fig 6.\nResearchers have developed many methods to analyze the\nstability of nanoﬂuid such as Zeta potential analysis, light\nscattering, electron microscopy, spectral analysis and sedi-\nmentation method.\nIlyas et al. [44] utilized batch sedimentation apparatus\nusing conventional visualization technique to analyze the\nstability of alumina-transformer oil nanoﬂuid. The surface\nof alumina nanoparticles was modiﬁed by functionalizing\ncarboxylic group using oleic acid and xylene. Results were\nobserved that functionalized nanoﬂuids do not show sed-\nimentation over a month, which can be shown in Fig 7.\nHowever, slight sedimentation was observed at high concen-\ntration of 3 wt.% after 4 weeks. Taha-Tijerina et al. [47]\nobserved high stability of h-BN-transformer oil after\n3 months, with loading between 0.01-0.1 wt.% using zeta-\npotential method. Bhunia et al. [43] observed good stability\noh h-BN-transformer oil nanoﬂuid utilizing UV-vis spec-\ntroscopy. It was reported that stability dropped around 4%\nin the ﬁrst 30 days and further dropped by 1% by the end of\n3 months.\nAlicia et al. [38] observed good stability with graphene-\ntransformer oil nanoﬂuid after 3 weeks utilizing UV-vis\nspectrophotometer as seen from Fig 8. Highest nanopar-\nticle loading of 0.1 wt.% resulted in 5.1% of sed-\nimentation at 170th hour before it stabilizes again.\n151428 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nFIGURE 7. Sedimentation of alumina-transformer oil nanofluids at\n(a) natural and (b) functionalized conditions [44].\nFIGURE 8. UV-vis Spectrophotometer of graphene-transformer oil\nnanofluid [38].\nTABLE 7. Absolute zeta potential of Ag- WO3-transformer oil\nnanofluid [39].\nAberoumand and Jafarimoghaddam [39] observed excellent\nstability after synthesizing hybrid Ag-WO 3-transformer oil\nnanoﬂuid utilizing zeta potential measurement, as shown\nin table 7. Zeta potential increased from 1 wt.% to 2 wt%\nnanoparticle loading but decreased at 4 wt.% for both 40 ◦C\nFIGURE 9. Zeta potential comparison SiO2-graphene and pure graphene\ntransformer oil nanofluid [46].\nFIGURE 10. Stability comparison SiO2-graphene and pure graphene\ntransformer oil nanofluid synthesized at pH 11 [34], [42].\nand 100 ◦C. It was reported that measured nanoﬂuid with zeta\npotential greater than 30mV is resulted to have high stabil-\nity [48]. Qing et al. [46] synthesized hybrid SiO 2-graphene-\ntransformer oil using sol-gel technique ranging from pH\n9-12 whereby pH 11 depicted the highest colloidal stability\nmeasured using zeta potential, shown in Fig 9. It was reported\nthat SiO2 coating improves stability by increasing the repul-\nsive electrostatic forces [49]. Amiri et al. [40] reported that\nstability of AGQD-based transformer oil nanoﬂuid degrades\nby less than 0.5% after a month, conﬁrmed by UV-Vis absorp-\ntion spectra. Fig 10displays stability comparison between the\nuse of graphene and hybrid SiO 2-graphene. It was reported\nthat hybrid SiO2-graphene with pH 11 has better stability than\npure graphene. Higher stability will ensure the properties of\nnanoparticles are fully utilized in the transformer oil.\nThe above reported studies conﬁrmed good stability and\ndispersion of nanoparticles in transformer oils. However,\nthe study period was only varied between one week to one\nmonth. It should be noted that there is no mechanical stirring\nor agitation in the transformer system. Hence, nanoparticles\nhave only natural convection to rely on good dispersion.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 151429\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nFIGURE 11. Density of alumina-transformer oil and AGCD-transformer oil nanofluid [36], [40].\nTransformer oil should be able to withstand for long periods\nwithout sedimentation to ensure smooth and safe continuous\noperation. However, more studies need to be conducted to\nmeasure the stability of the nanoﬂuids over a longer period\nand with varying operating temperatures.\nThe polarity of the nanoparticles inﬂuences nanoﬂuid sta-\nbility. Nanoparticles with high polarity tend to form clusters\nand eventually, agglomeration takes place [50]. Researchers\nhave studied ways to overcome the agglomeration by modi-\nfying the surface of the nanoparticles to reduce the polarity\nbehavior [36], [40], [42]. They reported that modifying\nthe surface of the nanoparticles enhanced the repulsive\nelectrostatic forces, improving the stability of the nanoﬂu-\nids. Besides, the addition of surfactants such as oleic acid\nreduces the agglomeration effect by weakening the bonds of\nnanoparticles [51].\nIV. THERMO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nA. DENSITY\nDensity is one of the important parameters that vary with\ntemperature. There is no mechanical mixing or agitation\nrequired inside the transformer system; hence, the ﬂuid mixes\nvia natural convection. Few studies have reported the den-\nsity of oils as a function of nanoparticle concentration and\ntemperature.\nFor instance, Ilyas et al. [44] predicted the density of\nfunctionalized alumina-transformer oil using a theoretical\nmodel proposed by Pak and Cho [52]. The results were found\nclose to the experimental results for low nanoparticle con-\ncentrations. Density observed to increase with the addition\nof nanoparticles and decreased with temperature elevation.\nIn another study, Amiri et al. [40] reported that the density\nof amine-based graphene quantum dots (AGQD)-transformer\noil degrades as temperature elevates due to thermal expansion\nof oil. The maximum difference between pure transformer oil\nand AGCD-transformer oil was reported to be 0.23% at 40 ◦C,\nwhich is negligible.\nComparing Ilyas et al. [44] and Amiri et al. [40], it can\nbe concluded AGQD-transformer oil depicted lower density\ncompared to alumina-based transformer oil, which can be\nviewed on Fig 11. However, the difference is that the nanopar-\nticle concentration used in AGQD-transformer oil is 0.001\nwt.% whereas alumina-transformer oil used the highest in\nthe study which is 3 wt.%. The deviation between these two\ntransformer-oil nanoﬂuids is not signiﬁcant. Further studies\nare required to determine the effect of blend oils, nanoparticle\nsize, type of nanoparticle and concentration of particles on the\ndensity of the nanoﬂuid.\nThe concentration of nanoparticles and temperature affect\nthe density of the nanoﬂuid. Density increases with increas-\ning nanoparticle concentration and decreases with rising tem-\nperature. The rise in temperature causes the liquid volume\nto expand causing its density to deplete. It should be noted\nthat introducing nanoparticles to transformer oil enhances\nheat transfer properties. However, this advantage may be\nnulliﬁed due to the increase in density since it is dependent on\nbuoyancy driven natural convection. Since agitator or stirring\nis absent in the transformer system, density, along with heat\nconvection property, of transformer oil nanoﬂuid should be\nstudied as nanoparticles can only rely solely on buoyancy\nforce for dispersion and stability.\nB. VISCOSITY\nThe viscosity of the oil is a measure of resistance to the\nshear rate of the oil. It is also known as continuous ﬂow\ncirculation or resistance of the ﬂow. The ﬂuid that possesses\nlow viscosity could lead to longer life cycle and more efﬁcient\nequipment.\nIlyas et al. [44] reported decreased in dynamic viscosity of\nalumina-based transformer oil nanoﬂuid with an increase in\n151430 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nFIGURE 12. Viscosity of SiO2-graphene nanofluids with respect to\nconcentration and temperature [46].\ntemperature due to the weakening of intermolecular forces of\nattraction between molecules. They reported that the change\nof viscosity at different shear rates for temperature ranging\nfrom 20 ◦C to 90 ◦C is negligible. Besides, an increase in\nnanoparticle concentration resulted in a slight enhancement\nin dynamic viscosity but the effect was found to be insignif-\nicant at high shear rates. It was found that at 25 ◦C, high\nnanoﬂuid concentrations enhanced dynamic viscosity by up\nto 18%.\nTaha-Tijerina et al. [47] observed a drop in viscosit; from\n16 mm 2 /s at room temperature to 2.2 mm 2 /s at 100 ◦C.\nThe enhancement of viscosity was small with the addition of\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanoﬁllers. Besides, it was\nalso reported that addition to the nanoﬁllers up to 0.05 wt.%\ndid not alter its viscosity but the effect was seen at higher\nnanoparticle loading of 0.35 wt.% (<30%).\nFontes et al. [53] observed a signiﬁcant effect on the\nviscosity of MWCNT-based transformer oil nanoﬂuid with\na loading of 0.05 vol.%. At the same nanoparticle concen-\ntration, diamond-based nanoﬂuid possessed lower viscosity\ncompared to MWCNT-based oils. Similarly, Choi et al. [37]\nreported enhancement in transformer oil nanoﬂuid viscosity\nwith an increase in Al 2O3 nanoparticle concentration up to\n4 vol%.\nAlicia et al. [38] reported a 24% enhancement in viscosity\nof graphene-based transformer oil. They observed that the\nviscosity decreases with the addition of graphene nanopar-\nticle concentration due to its self-lubricating effect [54].\nSimilarly, Qing et al. [46] observed an increase in viscosity\nof hybrid SO 2i-graphene-based transformer oil with loading\nnanoparticle addition (from 0.01 to 0.04 wt.%) but decreased\nwhen further addition of nanoparticles due to self-lubricating\nproperties. SiO2 possesses the ability that can reduce friction\nin nanoﬂuids [55]. They also reported that the highest viscos-\nity reduction was 75% when temperature elevated from 40 ◦C\nto 100 ◦C and resulted in no clear trend between viscosity\nand pH. Fig 12 displays the Viscosity of SO 2i-graphene\nnanoﬂuids with respect to concentration and temperature.\nFIGURE 13. Viscosity comparison with different types of nanoparticles at\nhighest studied concentration [34], [36], [40], [42], [43].\nAmiri et al. [40] observed a sharp decrease in viscosity of\namine-based graphene quantum dots (AGQD)-based trans-\nformer oil with an increase in temperature from 20 ◦C to\n80 ◦C. Maximum enhancement of viscosity due to 0.001\nwt.% nanoparticle loading was reported to be less than 1.3.\nSome studies also reported a decrease in viscosity with\ntemperature. This trait aids the dispersion and circulation of\nnanoparticles more freely in the transformer oil or base ﬂuid.\nFig 13 below compiles the viscosity of different types of\nnanoparticles with the highest studied concentration. Taha-\nTijerina et al. [47] showed low viscosity at 0.35 wt.% of\nh-BN nanoparticles, relatively close to Amiri et al. [40]\nwith 0.001 wt.% AGQD nanoparticles. On the other hand,\nalumina-based transformer oil with 3 wt.% has better vis-\ncosity decrement compared with pure graphene at 0.1 wt.%.\nWhile Fig 10demonstrates the effect of pH and temperature\non viscosity of SiO2/graphene based transformer oil [46].\nThe nanoﬂuids clearly showed a decrease in viscosity at\n100◦C compared to 40 ◦C. It was also observed that viscosity\nincreased with pH at 40 ◦C, which could be associated with\nthe size of SiO 2 on graphene. However, at 100 ◦C negligible\neffect of pH on viscosity was reported.\nLike density, introducing nanoparticles to transformer oil\nwould enhance its viscosity but decreases with rising temper-\nature. The viscosity of the nanoﬂuid increases with nanopar-\nticle concentration due to the formation of clusters that were\nbonded by its forces of attraction, obstructing the ﬂow of\nﬂuid [56]. It involves more energy to overcome the internal\nresistance of the nanoﬂuid. However, the increasing temper-\nature reduces the viscosity of nanoﬂuid due to an increase\nin the average velocity of the Brownian motion of nanoparti-\ncles [57]. More energy is introduced to weaken the bonds of\nmolecules, decreasing the internal resistance of the nanoﬂuid.\nLow viscosity nanoﬂuids are favorable since it allows ﬂuid to\nﬂow easily and for nanoparticles to disperse.\nC. THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY\nThermal conductivity is one of the key properties that has\nthe capacity to conduct heat. The main motivation of trans-\nformer oils in upgrading the functionality and operability of\nVOLUME 7, 2019 151431\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nFIGURE 14. Thermal images of bare oil and nanofluid with heating\ntime [43].\ncoolant or insulation is enhancing the thermal conductivity.\nThis plays a vital role in increasing the heat transfer of the\nbase ﬂuid. Therefore, it is important for any desired ﬂuid to\nhave high thermal conductivity. This can be achieved by the\naddition of nanoparticles into the base ﬂuids [58] Moreover,\nheavy-operating machines or equipment that generate heat\nrequires coolant or cooling system. In brief, energy is trans-\nferred from one molecule to other due to high kinetic energy.\nThe collision rate is enhanced with an increase in temperature\ndue to Brownian motion. Thus, transformer oils or power\ntransmission ﬂuids are required to have high thermal conduc-\ntivity to dissipate heat.\nIlyas et al. [44] reported that the thermal conductivity\nof functionalized alumina-based transformer oil enhanced\nwith temperature elevation, from 25 ◦C to 55 ◦C, and\nnanoparticle concentration. They observed that the high-\nest nanoparticle concentration of 3 wt.% resulted in the\nmaximum thermal conductivity enhancement up to 16%.\nTaha-Tijerina et al. [47] observed enhanced thermal con-\nductivity as temperature elevates, from 20 ◦C to 50 ◦C\nand addition of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanoﬁllers.\nEnhancement of thermal conductivity was resulted to\nbe by about 77% with h-BN loading of 0.1 wt.%.\nFontes et al. [53] resulted in thermal conductivity enhance-\nment in both diamond-based and MWCNT-based nanoﬂu-\nids. They observed that MWCNT-based nanoﬂuid resulted\nin higher thermal conductivity ranging from 11 to 25%\nwith varying nanoparticle concentration. However, the ther-\nmal conductivities were measured at a constant temperature\nof 20 ◦C.\nBhunia et al. [43] observed an enhancement in thermal\nconductivity with temperature and boron nitride nanosheets.\nMaximum thermal conductivity increment was about 45%\nwith a loading of 0.05 wt.% nanosheets. Heating experiments\nwere performed to demonstrate the temperature distribution\nproﬁle, as shown in Fig 14. The temperature of the nanoﬂuid\nquickly increased with particle concentration and heating\nFIGURE 15. Thermal conductivity at (a) pH 9 (b) pH 10 and (c)\npH11 hybrid SiO2-Graphene transformer oil nanofluid [46].\ntime demonstrating the faster heat transport in the presence\nof nanoparticles.\nChoi et al. [37] reported more than 20% enhancement\nat 4 vol% of Al 2O3 nanoparticles. They also reported\nthat AlN-based transformer oil has its thermal conductivity\nenhanced by 8% with 0.5 vol.% AlN nanoparticles.\n151432 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nFIGURE 16. Thermal conductivity enhancement comparison with respect\nto temperature [34], [35], [40], [42], [43].\nAlicia et al. [38] have reported maximum thermal conduc-\ntivity of about 29% with respect to graphene concentration at\n60 ◦C varying between 0.01 to 0.1 wt.%. On the contrary,\nwith respect to temperature, 0.1 wt.% graphene loading\nshowed thermal conductivity enhancement up to 69%. Drop\nin thermal conductivity at 40 ◦C was observed due to the\nnature of naphthenic transformer oil [59]. Aberoumand and\nJafarimoghaddam [39] observed enhanced thermal conduc-\ntivity as temperature elevates with Ag-WO 3-transformer oil\nnanoﬂuids. Thermal conductivity was enhanced by 41% at\n100 ◦C with WO 3 concentration of 4 wt.%.\nFig 16below displays a comparison between thermal con-\nductivity enhancements as a function of temperature. Trans-\nformer oil nanoﬂuid synthesized by Qing et al. [46] observed\nthe highest thermal conductivity increment with the addi-\ntion of pH 9 and 0.04 wt.% silicon dioxide (SiO 2)-graphene\nnanoparticle concentration. However, the thermal conduc-\ntivity of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) transformer oil\nnanoﬂuid, prepared by Taha-Tijerina et al. [47], enhanced\nby 77% with maximum studied temperature of 50 ◦C\nand nanoparticle loading of 0.1 wt.%. Pure graphene-based\nnanoﬂuid, synthesized by Alicia et al. [38], demonstrated\nthermal conductivity very close to Taha-Tijerina et al with\nthe enhancement of 69% at 100 ◦C and nanoparticle concen-\ntration of 0.1 wt.%. Aberoumand and Jafarimoghaddam [39]\nobserved thermal conductivity enhancement of 41% with\n4 wt.% of tungsten (iii) dioxide (WO 3) at 100 ◦C. Researchers\nhave observed an increase in thermal conductivity with rising\ntemperature, regardless of the nanoparticle selection, due to\nthe growing of Brownian motion. As temperature increases,\nthe nanoparticles absorb more kinetic energy causing more\nparticle collisions. Rate of particle collisions enhances with\nrising temperature due to Brownian motion. A higher concen-\ntration of nanoparticles would enhance thermal conductivity\nas more particle collision occur. However, nanoparticle con-\ncentration should be controlled as it would jeopardize other\nproperties, especially stability and dielectric properties.\nD. BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE & DIELECTRIC STRENGTH\nHeavy-duty equipment or machines such as transformers deal\nhigh currents and voltages. Transformer oils not only need\nto dissipate heat but to withstand or insulate electric ﬁeld\nto ensure safe operations. Having transformer oil with high\ndielectric strength or breakdown voltage at disposal will not\nonly result in safe operations, but reduction of volume and\nmass of transformer itself could also be achieved. However,\nselecting the type of nanoparticles is crucial to ensure the\nbreakdown voltage or dielectric strength does not deplete.\nAberoumand and Jarimoghaddam [39] observed degra-\ndation from 7.5% to 34% in the dielectric strength of\nhybrid transformer oil nanoﬂuid as loading of nanoparti-\ncle increased. They reported that the introduction of silver\nnanoparticle dragged the dielectric strength. Amiri et al. [40]\nobserved the enhancement of electrical conductivity with\nthe introduction of AGQD. With nanoparticle loading\nof 0.01 wt.%, the electrical conductivity enhanced by less\nthan 5%. They then tested the breakdown voltage of the\nnanoﬂuid and resulted in a 2.2% enhancement compared to\npure transformer oil.\nQing et al. [46] reported that hybrid nanoﬂuids of\npH 10 and 11 suppressed electrical conductivity by 97%.\nThey found that electrical conductivity enhanced with the\naddition of nanoparticle concentration and degraded pH due\nto net charge effect of graphene particles. However, enhanc-\ning pH would increase SiO 2 concentration thus suppressing\nthe electrical conductivity. Kopčanský et al. [35] observed\nbetter dielectric properties with less than 0.01 volume con-\ncentration of magnetic nanoparticles than pure transformer\noil. They concluded that the ﬁeld induced aggregation of\nmagnetic particles affects the dielectric breakdown strength\nof nanoﬂuids.\nRaﬁq et al. [60] observed an enhancement of breakdown\nvoltage by up to about 37% with the highest Fe 3O4 nanopar-\nticle concentration of 40%. However, further addition of\nnanoparticles concentration would upset the nanoﬂuid break-\ndown voltage. On top of that, negative impulse breakdown\nvoltage resulted in degradation as nanoparticles concentra-\ntion enhanced. Raﬁq et al. [42] reported improved AC and\npositive impulse breakdown voltages when utilizing 20 vol.%\nSiO2 nanoparticle. However, negative impulse breakdown\nvoltage degrades after adding nanoparticles.\nMuangpratoom et al. [61] compared the breakdown volt-\nage of pure transformer oil with TiO 2 and BaTiO 3 based\ntransformer oil nanoﬂuid at 0.01 and 0.03 vol% nanoparticle\nloading. Breakdown voltage increased with the rise in tem-\nperature. The highest breakdown voltage enhancement, com-\npared with pure transformer oil, was 35% and 37% of 0.03\nvol% TiO 2 and BaTiO 3, respectively. Muangpratoom and\nKunakorn [62] also studied and compared breakdown voltage\nof pure transformer oil with ZnO based transformer oil at\n0.01 and 0.03 vol% nanoparticle concentration.\nYang Ge et al. [63] studied various TiO 2 nanoparticle size\nvarying from 5 nm to 15 nm with a ﬁxed 0.075 vol% concen-\ntration. It was found that 5 nm, 10 nm and 15 nm powdered\nVOLUME 7, 2019 151433\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nTiO2 changes to 35 nm, 15 nm and 225 nm, respectively, once\ndispersed in transformer oil. TiO 2 nanoparticles at 15 nm in\ntransformer oil resulted in the highest breakdown strength\nincrement compared to pure transformer oil, which is by\n110%. Chen et al. [64] studied and compared breakdown\nvoltage of pure transformer oil with Fe 3O4, TiO2 and Al2O3\nbased transformer oil nanoﬂuid. At same nanoparticle con-\ncentration, Fe 3O4, TiO 2 and Al 2O3 based resulted in 41%,\n30% and 7%, respectively, breakdown voltage enhancement\ncompared to pure transformer oil.\nSumathi et al. [65] investigated the dielectric strength of\nhybrid TiO 2/Al2O3/MoS2 based transformer oil nanoﬂuid\nwith nanoparticle concentration ranging from 0.01 to\n0.1 vol%. Response surface methodology was used to opti-\nmize the nanoparticle loadings dispersed in transformer\noil. The optimum hybrid nanoparticle concentrations were\n0.094 vol. % of Al 2O3, 0.014 vol% of TiO 2 and 0.097 vol%\nof MoS2 and predicted 77.7062 kV/cm of dielectric strength.\nConﬁrmation test was performed with the optimum loadings\nand resulted in 77.02 kV/cm, 0.6862 kV/cm deviation. This\noptimized hybrid nanoparticle loading resulted in 7.7 times\nincrement than pure transformer oil.\nMadavan et al. [66] studied and compared various types\nof natural esters as transformer oil with pure transformer\noil. Al 2O3, BN and Fe 3O4 nanoparticles were used with\nvolume concentration from 0.05 to 0.5 vol%. Honge oil with\n0.05 vol% of Al 2O3, neem oil with 0.25 vol% of BN, Punna\noil with 0.5 vol% of BN, Honge oil with 0.05 vol% of Fe 3O4\nand neem oil with 0.5 vol% Fe 3O4 were few of the high-\nest breakdown voltage enhancement. Al 2O3, BN and Fe 3O4\nresulted enhanced breakdown voltage by up to 36.1%, 47.2%\nand 50% in transformer oil whereas 30.6%, 29.7% and 31.2%\nin natural esters.\nDu et al. [67] synthesized BN based transformer oil with\nnanoparticle concentration varying from 0.01 to 0.1 wt.%.\nIt was reported that increasing nanoparticle loading enhanced\nrelative permittivity by up to 5.5%. Besides, the dissipa-\ntion factor decreased with the addition of BN nanoparti-\ncles from 0.315% to 0.226%.

[68] synthesized ZrO 2-based transformer\noil with nanoparticle loading from 0.001 to 0.006 wt%.\nAt room temperature, the breakdown voltage enhanced by\n202% with 0.001 wt.% of ZrO 2. However, further addi-\ntion of nanoparticles depleted the breakdown voltage to\nenhancement by 129%. On the contrary, breakdown volt-\nage enhanced with the rise in temperature from 25%\nto 143%.\nAberoumand and Jafarimoghaddam [39] synthesized\nhybrid tungsten oxide-silver nanoparticles that depleted\ndielectric strength. However, introducing elements such as\nSiO2 enhances the electrical insulation property. Ensuring\ntransformer oil nanoﬂuid resulted in breakdown voltage or\ndielectric strength increment is important for safe operations\nso that the oil withstand high voltages, generated by the\ntransformer.\nFIGURE 17. Comparison of breakdown voltage of transformer oil\nnanofluid against temperature with different nanoparticle type and\nconcentration [56], [57], [63].\nFIGURE 18. Breakdown voltage comparison with different type of\nnanoparticles [35], [38], [58], [59], [61].\nFig 17displays the comparison of breakdown voltage as a\nfunction of temperature. The transformer nanoﬂuid selected\nshowed the highest increment that the researcher investigated.\nRegardless of the nanoparticle type and concentration, break-\ndown voltage enhanced with increase in temperature. Muang-\npratoom et al. [61], and Muangpratoom and Kunakorn [62]\nsynthesized ZnO and BaTiO3 based transformer oil nanoﬂuid\nand reported ZnO-based enhanced higher than BaTiO 3-based\nat the same nanoparticle loading, which is 0.03 vol%. How-\never, the deviation between two transformer oil nanoﬂu-\nids is insigniﬁcant. Comparing to Abd-Elhady et al. [68],\nthe breakdown voltage of ZnO-based and BaTiO 3-based\nare greater than ZrO 2-based. However, the ZrO 2-based\ntransformer oil was synthesized with nanoparticle loading\nof 0.001 wt.%.\nFig 18 displays the comparison of breakdown voltage\nbetween various types of transformer oil nanoﬂuid. The trans-\nformer oil nanoﬂuids were selected based on the highest\nbreakdown voltage achieved by the researchers. Fe 3O4-based\ntransformer oil, synthesized by Chen et al [64], achieved the\nhighest breakdown voltage compared to other transformer\noil nanoﬂuids with 0.0227% concentration. Al 2O3-based\n151434 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD. Amininet al.: Recent Progress and Challenges in Transformer Oil Nanofluid Development\nFIGURE 19. Schematic representation of enhanced breakdown voltage of\ntransformer oil after the addition of nanoparticles.\ntransformer oil, synthesized by Madavan et al. [66], was\nslightly higher than the TiO 2-based transformer oil, synthe-\nsized by Yang Ge et al. [63]. The difference between these\ntwo nanoﬂuids is that Madavan et al dispersed 0.05 vol%\nAl2O3 into Honge oil (natural esters) whereas Yang Ge et al\ndispersed 0.075 vol% TiO 2 into transformer oil. Comparing\nto the other synthesized nanoﬂuids, Aberoumand & Jafari-\nmoghaddam [39] utilized 1 wt.% WO 3 and resulted in the\nlowest breakdown voltage.\nResearchers observed that the addition of nanoparti-\ncles enhanced the breakdown voltage of transformer oil.\nThe nanoparticles acted as scattering obstacles and trap sites\nin the charge carrier paths, limiting the electrons’ mobility\n(shown in Fig 19) [61], [64]. Size of nanoparticles plays a\nrole in enhancing the breakdown voltage of transformer oil\nnanoﬂuid. Smaller nanoparticle size ensures a greater density\nof the nanoparticle in the nanoﬂuid than nanoparticle with\nthe larger size for the same concentration. This increases the\nnanoparticle population to trap free electrons from streamers\nat a higher rate, leading to higher breakdown strength [70]\nBesides, nanoparticle type inﬂuences the breakdown voltage.\nFor instance, Fe 3O4-based have higher breakdown voltage\ndue to low relaxation time constant and higher scavenging\nrate of charges from streamer [66]. However, increasing the\nvolume concentration would deplete the breakdown voltage\ndue alteration of electrodynamic of nanoﬂuids [71].\nE. MOISTURE CONTENT\nMoisture content would degrade the cooling and insulation\neffect of the coolant, especially when used in power trans-\nformers. High moisture content would degrade insulation of\nthe transformer oil as electrical conduction would likely to\noccur. However, this parameter was not investigated when\nsynthesizing transformer oil nanoﬂuids.\nMenkiti et al. [72] utilized Terminalia catappa kernel oil as\nan alternative to mineral transformer oil whereby the kernel\noil was synthesized via direct puriﬁcation and transesteri-\nﬁcation method. Comparing with two methods, kernel oil\nthat was obtained by transesteriﬁcation showed the lowest\nmoisture content ranging from 0.9-1.0 mg/kg which agreed\nto result reported by Usman et al. [73]\nTABLE 8. Moisture content comparison with different types of\nnanoparticles dispersed in transformer oil [56], [57].\nTABLE 9. summary of the challenges and future work of transformer oil\nnanofluids.\nSohel Murshed et al.

Regardless of the nanoparticle\nconcentration and presence of surfactant, there was no sig-\nniﬁcant difference in moisture content, with less than 5%\nincrement. The mineral oil and nanoﬂuids were dried using\na vacuum oven before proceeding further analysis. Table 8\nbelow displays the moisture content of different types of\nnanoparticles used dispersed in transformer oil.\nPresence of moisture content in transformer oil is unde-\nsirable but it cannot be removed completely due to the\npresence of moisture in the atmosphere. Water molecules\nhave high polarity where the oxygen atom tends to be nega-\ntively charged while the hydrogen atom tends to be positively\nVOLUME 7, 2019 151435\nD.

Unlike mineral oils, vegetable oil contains fatty\nacids which is responsible for attracting water molecules\nwhich accelerates the aging and degradation processes. Vac-\nuum drying is one of the steps that should be involved dur-\ning the nanoﬂuid synthesis in order to reduce the moisture\ncontent.\nV. CONCLUSION, CHALLENGES AND FUTURE WORK\nResearch works on the stability improvement, thermos-\nphysical and dielectric properties of transformer oil have been\nconducted but remain challenging and open new window of\nopportunities for future researchers. The use of nanoparticles\nhas demonstrated interesting traits to enhance these trans-\nformer oil properties ranging from fully conductive to insulat-\ning nanoparticles. The development of transformer oil could\npotentially improve the operation of the transformer itself and\nperhaps reduced machine size or volume overall. Even though\nsuch research has been reported and investigated, there are\nmore challenges that have yet to be solved;\n• Stability of the transformer oil-based nanoﬂuid was\nnot investigated in detail with respect to temperature\nand for a longer duration, which limits its application.\nPreparation of stable nanoﬂuid itself can be achieved\nthrough dispersion means. However, dispersing hybrid\nnanoparticles into a base ﬂuid is a challenge due to\nparticle charge traits.\n• Selection of nanoparticle type with enhanced thermal\nconductivity should possess high dielectric strength or\nbreakdown voltage for excellent insulation\n• Study and comparison of thermo-physical proper-\nties between mineral oil and vegetable oil to high-\nlight the importance of transformer oil act as a\ncoolant.\n• Blend oil research is limited; a mixture of mineral and\nvegetable oils for good synergy. Vegetable oil has proven\nto be an environmentally friendly, biodegradable and\nsafer alternative for transformer oil but still, possess\nweaknesses. Blend oils could result in improved over-\nall properties provided a careful selection of vegetable\noil.\n• Investigation of transformer oil-based nanoﬂuid degra-\ndation is rarely done, which limits further study. Effect\nof nanoparticle and blend oil concentration on the shelf\nlife of transformer oils is yet to be investigated.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C. AJ, M. A. Salam, Q. M. Rahman, F. Wen, S. P. Ang, and\nW.
