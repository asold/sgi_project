    "abstract": "The article contains information on research carried out in Electric Faculty of Silesian University of Technology, made at test stations and aimed at diagnosis how is actual technical state of high voltage power oil transformers.Opinion on a state of transformers is based on analysis results of partial discharge measurements.Authors use simultaneously: electric, acoustic and dissolved gas analysis method.Applied acoustic method is the original own one.Non-conventional application of electric method is proposed, too.In the frame of chosen methodology the partial discharges are measured and next calculations of quantities describing partial discharges within particular methods are carried out in order to describe phenomena commonly for electric and acoustic method.Information sources about level and kind of partial discharges are measurement results obtained from electric method whereas information on places where partial discharges appear is contained in measurement results coming from acoustic method.Authors present selected application results of such a combined measuring method.",
