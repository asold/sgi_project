In this\nwork, we investigate why current models strug-\ngle with implicit reasoning question answer-\ning (QA) tasks, by decoupling inference of rea-\nsoning steps from their execution. We define\na new task of implicit relation inference and\nconstruct a benchmark, IMPLICIT RELATIONS ,\nwhere given a question, a model should out-\nput a list of concept-relation pairs, where the\nrelations describe the implicit reasoning steps\nrequired for answering the question. Using IM-\nPLICIT RELATIONS , we evaluate models from\nthe GPT-3 family and find that, while these\nmodels struggle on the implicit reasoning QA\ntask, they often succeed at inferring implicit re-\nlations. This suggests that the challenge in im-\nplicit reasoning questions does not stem from\nthe need to plan a reasoning strategy alone, but\nto do it while also retrieving and reasoning over\nrelevant information.\n1 Introduction\nA longstanding goal of language understanding has\nbeen to develop systems that can reason, i.e., inte-\ngrate multiple pieces of information to reach a con-\nclusion (McCarthy, 1959; Clark et al., 2021). This\nhas sparked interest in question answering (QA)\nbenchmarks that require such reasoning (Welbl\net al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Talmor and Berant,\n2018). One particularly challenging case is ques-\ntions that require implicit reasoning, that is, where\nthe evidence for answering the question is not men-\ntioned explicitly. Consider the question “Does\nSanta Claus work during summer?”. This question\nrequires implicit reasoning since it involves know-\ning when the holiday associated with Santa occurs,\nbut this is not evident from the question.\nRecent advances in QA (Tafjord and Clark, 2021;\nLourie et al., 2021) have steered attention towards\nWould a stool be useful for a \nLusotitan to reach the top of an almond tree?\n⟨Lusotitan , height⟩ ⟨almond tree , height⟩\n“The adult Lusotitan \nwas over 25 \nmeters high”\n“Almond trees can \ngrow up to 10 \nmeters high”  >\nFALSE\nImplicit \nrelations\nRetrieval / \nReasoning\nAnswer\nQuestion\nFigure 1: An example implicit reasoning question ,\nwhere answering requires inferring implicit relations\nthat are not explicitly mentioned. Besides implicit re-\nlations, answering the question also requires reasoning\nover the relevant retrieved facts. In this work, we focus\non the first step of inferring implicit relations.\nimplicit reasoning QA benchmarks such as STRAT-\nEGY QA (Geva et al., 2021), OPEN CSR (Lin et al.,\n2021), COMMONSENSE QA 2.0 (Talmor et al.,\n2021), CREAK (Onoe et al., 2021), and REAL FP\n(Kalyan et al., 2021), which span a wide range of\ndomains and reasoning skills. Still, implicit rea-\nsoning remains an open challenge, even for large\nlanguage models (LMs) such as GPT-3 and PaLM\n(BIG-bench collab., 2021; Talmor et al., 2021; Rae\net al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022).\nAnswering implicit reasoning questions can be\nviewed as a two-step process: (a) inferring simple\nsub-questions necessary for answering the question,\nand (b) retrieving the relevant knowledge pieces\n(i.e., answering sub-questions) and reasoning over\nthem to derive the answer. Figure 1 illustrates\nthis decoupling. To answer the shown question,\nwe need to use knowledge about the Lusotitan di-\nnosaur and almond trees to infer that the relevant\nsub-questions concern their heights. We refer to the\nrelation height, which is not mentioned in the ques-\ntion as an implicit relation. Once implicit relations\nare inferred, we can retrieve the relevant facts and\ndeduce that the answer is ‘False’, as a Lusotitan is\n2548\nSource Dataset Question and Implicit Relation Pairs Answer\nSTRATEGY QA\nDid the 40th president of the United States forward lolcats to his friends?\n⟨40th president of the United States, year of death⟩, ⟨lolcats, year of creation⟩ False\nCould $1 for each 2009 eclipse buy a copy of TIME magazine in 2020?\n⟨2009 eclipse, number⟩, ⟨TIME magazine in 2020, retail price⟩ True\nCREAK\nAziz Ansari has never performed in front of a crowd.\n⟨Aziz Ansari, profession⟩ False\nPantera made music with distorted guitars.\n⟨Pantera, music genre⟩ True\nCSQA2.0\nNone of the mail in a person’s Yahoo inbox has a stamp on it.\n⟨Yahoo inbox, type of mailbox⟩ True\nIf you play a cello you cannot join the marching band.\n⟨cello, playing posture⟩ True\nTable 1: Example annotations of concept-relation pairs from IMPLICIT RELATIONS along with the question source\ndataset and answer. Each source exhibits different facets of implicit reasoning questions.\nmuch higher than an almond tree.\nIn this work, we put a spotlight on implicit rela-\ntions and investigate the ability of language models\nto infer them as a necessary (albeit insufficient) step\nfor answering implicit reasoning questions. We\nfirst define implicit relations, and show that they\ncan be reliably annotated through crowdsourcing\n(example annotated implicit relations are in Fig-\nure 1 and Table 1). To show implicit relations are\ncommon, we curate and annotate implicit reason-\ning questions from three existing datasets, STRAT-\nEGY QA, CREAK , and COMMONSENSE QA 2.0 ,\nwhich results in IMPLICIT RELATIONS , a new eval-\nuation benchmark containing 615 questions and\n2,673 annotations of implicit relations.\nWe use our benchmark to evaluate the ability of\nlarge LMs to infer implicit relations, since they are\nknown to acquire substantial amounts of knowl-\nedge and common sense with scale (Roberts et al.,\n2020; Liu et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022), but strug-\ngle with implicit reasoning questions. Specifically,\nwe evaluate models from the GPT-3 family using\nin-context learning, where the model is fixed and\nonly a few examples are given as context.\nWe find that large LMs perform well on this task,\nwith a 175B parameter model recovering 0.53-0.59\nof the implicit relations across datasets, outper-\nforming a baseline by 21-40 points. This is robust\nacross methods for sampling in-context examples,\nand even in cross-data scenarios where in-context\nexamples are sampled from a different dataset than\nthe target question. However, inferring implicit\nrelations does not improve accuracy on the down-\nstream QA task, even when gold relations are pro-\nvided. This suggests that the challenge of implicit\nreasoning questions is not primarily due to implicit\nrelation inference, but possibly due to the need to\nalso retrieve information and reason over it.\nTo conclude, in this work we propose the notion\nof implicit relations, and construct the IMPLIC -\nITRELATIONS evaluation benchmark for testing\nthe ability of models to infer them from questions.\nWe evaluate large LMs and show that they infer im-\nplicit relations fairly well, while still falling short\nof answering implicit reasoning questions. Our\nwork facilitates future work on improving implicit\nrelation inference, and sheds light on the factors\nrelevant for developing models that can handle im-\nplicit reasoning. From a broader perspective, our\nwork joins recent community efforts to highlight\nthe ubiquity of missing and implicit elements in\nnatural language (Cheng and Erk, 2018; Pyatkin\net al., 2020; Elazar et al., 2022). 1\n2 Implicit Relations\nWe now define the notion of implicit relations in\nthe context of complex question answering.\nComplex questions are questions that require\nmultiple steps of reasoning in order to be answered\n(Yang et al., 2018; Talmor and Berant, 2018; Welbl\net al., 2018; Khot et al., 2021). For example,\nthe question “Was Linnaeus alive when Darwin\npublished Origin of Species?” involves fetching\ntwo dates and then comparing them (Figure 2).\nA prominent challenge in complex QA, that at-\ntracted substantial attention recently (Mihaylov\net al., 2018; Khashabi et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021;\n1Our benchmark IMPLICIT RELATIONS and relevant\ncode can be downloaded from github.com/katzurik/\nImplicitRelations.\n2549\nDid Linnaeus edit \nDarwin's draft of Origin \nof Species?\nWas Linnaeus alive \nwhen Darwin published \nOrigin of Species?\ns1  When did Carl \nLinnaeus pass away?\ns2  When was Origin of \nSpecies first published?\ns3  Is #2 before #1?\nImplicit Reasoning Explicit Reasoning\nDecomposition  D Implicit Relations  I\n⟨Origin of Species ,   \n year published⟩\n⟨Linnaeus , \n year of death⟩i1\ni2\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nLogical\nFigure 2: An example of explicit and implicit reasoning\nquestions that share the same question decomposition,\nalong with the implicit relations derived from the re-\ntrieval steps in the decomposition.\nGeva et al., 2021; Yasunaga et al., 2021; Wei et al.,\n2022), is cases where the reasoning steps are im-\nplicit and should be inferred from the question. For\ninstance, “Did Linnaeus edit Darwin’s draft of Ori-\ngin of Species?” involves the same reasoning steps,\nbut they are not mentioned explicitly. Thus, the\nformer question is an explicit reasoning question,\nwhile the latter is an implicit one (Figure 2).\nWolfson et al. (2020) proposed QDMR as a\nmeaning representation for complex questions,\nwhere a complex question qis decomposed into a\nsequence of mreasoning steps D= (s1,...,s m),\nand each step si corresponds to a simple natural\nlanguage question. Answering the simple questions\none-by-one yields the final answer (see decompo-\nsition in Figure 2). Geva et al. (2021) collected\ndecompositions for implicit reasoning questions as\npart of the STRATEGY QA dataset, where impor-\ntantly, inferring the sequence of reasoning steps\nis challenging due to their implicit nature. In ad-\ndition to generating effective decompositions for\nimplicit reasoning questions, we find an additional\nchallenge in evaluating these decompositions when\nrepresented as a sequence of sub-questions. Specif-\nically, Geva et al. (2021) distinguished two types\nof reasoning steps in a decomposition – retrieval\nsteps, which require retrieval of facts (s1 and s2 in\nFigure 2), and logical steps, which perform logical\nreasoning over previous results (s3 in Figure 2).\nIn this work, we observe that a key ingredient\nin inferring decompositions is to identify the im-\nplicit relations that are necessary for answering the\nquestion. Concretely, each retrieval step in a ques-\ntion decomposition can typically be represented as\nconcept-relation pair ⟨c,r⟩, where cis a sequence\nof tokens from the question that refer to a concept,\nand r is a relation of that concept. For example,\nthe concept cin step s2 in Figure 2 is “Origin of\nSpecies”, and the relation ris its publication year.\nBased on this observation, we provide the follow-\ning definition for implicit relations in complex QA.\nLet qbe an implicit reasoning question, and denote\nby D = (s1,...,s m) its decomposition into a se-\nquence of mreasoning steps. Let {si1 ,...,s in }\nbe the subset of retrieval steps in the decomposi-\ntion D. We define the implicit relations for an-\nswering qas the set I= {⟨c1,r1⟩,..., ⟨cn,rn⟩}of\nconcept-relation pairs, where each concept-relation\npair corresponds to a particular retrieval step.\nIn the next sections, we will use this definition\nto construct a task for probing the ability of models\nto infer implicit relations (§3-§5), and investigate\nwhy they struggle on the downstream QA task (§6).\n3 The I MPLICIT RELATIONS Benchmark\nIn this section, we describe the process of creating\nIMPLICIT RELATIONS , a benchmark for evaluating\nthe ability of models to infer implicit relations.\n3.1 Data Collection\nWe curate questions that require inferring implicit\nrelations from three recent datasets:\n• STRATEGY QA (Geva et al., 2021): A dataset of\nyes/no questions that require implicit multi-step\nreasoning. STRATEGY QA (STGQA) questions\ncan be answered from Wikipedia, and are diverse\nin terms of the required reasoning skills and ques-\ntion topic. Large language models, such as GPT-\n3 (Brown et al., 2020), were shown to struggle\non STGQA (BIG-bench collab., 2021).\n• CREAK (Onoe et al., 2021): A dataset containing\ntrue/false statements that require common sense\nand knowledge about real-world entities.\n• CSQA2 (Talmor et al., 2021): A dataset contain-\ning yes/no questions and true/false statements.\nCSQA2 questions involve generic commonsense\nreasoning. Most questions do not require knowl-\nedge about particular entities.\nExamples from each dataset are shown in Table 1.\nCollecting questions from three sources serves\ntwo purposes. First, it demonstrates that infer-\nring implicit relations is necessary for many ques-\ntion types: in multi-step questions ( STGQA) and\nsingle-step questions (CREAK ), in entity-focused\n2550\nquestions ( CREAK ) and generic common sense\nquestions (CSQA2 ). Second, these datasets were\ncreated using different protocols: STGQA and\nCSQA2 use a model-in-the-loop during data col-\nlection, while CREAK does not. STGQA and\nCREAK ask annotators to author questions freely,\nwhile CSQA2 employs a gamification mechanism.\nHaving questions from different data collection\npipelines increases the likelihood that empirical\nconclusions are not tied to a particular dataset.\nQuestion curation We chose questions that sat-\nisfy two properties: (a) answering the question\nrequires inferring an implicit relation, and (b) the\nquestion is feasible, that is, it can be answered us-\ning real-world facts (provided as part of the bench-\nmark in STGQA and CREAK ) or using generic com-\nmon sense (in CSQA2 ). We sampled examples\nfrom the training set of each of the three datasets\nand kept questions that satisfy the two properties.\nAnnotating implicit relations We use Amazon\nMechanical Turk to annotate implicit relations over\ncurated questions. We qualify 15 crowdworkers to\nidentify concepts, which are token sequences from\nthe question, relevant for answering the question,\nand the corresponding relation for each concept\n(see annotation guidelines in Appendix C). Anno-\ntators can specify up to four concept-relation pairs\nper question, but in practice, 98.9% consist of ≤2\npairs. Concepts must be extracted directly from\nthe input questions, and relations are phrased using\nconcise natural language phrases.\nFor STGQA and CREAK , which often require\nuncommon knowledge about entities, we provided\nadditional context from the original data source.\nFor STGQA, we provided facts along with the full\nquestion decomposition. For CREAK , we provided\nan explanation for why the claim is true or false.\nWe collected 5 annotations per example in\nCREAK and CSQA2 , and 3 annotations inSTGQA.\nDue to the availability of facts and question de-\ncompositions, STGQA showed high agreement\nbetween annotators (see Table 2). CREAK and\nCSQA2 showed more variability, and thus, we col-\nlected more annotations per example. To ensure\nquality, we manually verified all examples created\nduring the annotation process, filtering out annota-\ntions that do not fit the task requirements.\n3.2 Data Analysis\nTable 2 provides statistics on the collected data.\nIMPLICIT RELATIONS consists of 615 annotated\nSTGQA C REAK CSQA2\n# of questions 201 205 209\n# of unique concepts 399 309 303\n# of concept-relation pairs 1139 1272 1285\nConcept agreement 87% 71% 74%\nRelation agreement:\nLexical variability 85% 65% 80%\nMultiple reasoning paths 15% 35% 20%\nTable 2: Statistics on IMPLICIT RELATIONS .\nquestions, ∼200 per dataset, where exactly 100\nexamples from each data source are used as a test\nset, and the rest are used as a development set.\nDevelopment set examples are in Appendix A.\nAnnotator Agreement We manually analyzed\n20 random examples from each data source to eval-\nuate agreement between annotators for concepts\nand relations. We declared concept agreement\nwhen at least three annotators identified the same\nconcept in an example. We found that annotators\nagreed on 77% of the concepts, and less than 10%\nof concepts were extracted only by a single annota-\ntor. See Table 2 for break-down by data source.\nAssessing agreement on relations is more chal-\nlenging, since relations are short phrases that can\ndiffer lexically. We marked for each example\nwhether annotated relations differed only lexically\nor due to multiple reasoning strategies for answer-\ning the question. In 76% of the examples, the\nrelations across all annotators were identical or dif-\nfered lexically, e.g., the relations “average price”\nand “cost”. In 24% of the examples, multiple rea-\nsoning strategies were used, which would result in\ndifferent reasoning and retrieval steps (see Table 2).\nOverall, our analysis suggests that implicit rela-\ntions can be annotated reliably.\n4 Experimental Setting\nWe now turn to evaluate the ability of large LMs\nto infer implicit relations in questions. To this end,\nwe use examples from IMPLICIT RELATIONS in a\nfew-shot in-context learning setting (Brown et al.,\n2020), where given several input-output examples\nand a test input, the LM is expected to generate the\nrequired output. We focus on this setup following\nthe recent progress in in-context learning, specifi-\ncally for tasks that involve general commonsense\nreasoning (Da et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022).\n2551\n4.1 Task and Model Specification\nGiven a test question q∗, we prepend k an-\nnotated examples {⟨q(i),I(i)⟩}k\ni=1 to it, where\nq(i) is the i-th question in this set and I(i) =\n{⟨c(i)\n1 ,r(i)\n1 ⟩,..., ⟨c(i)\nni ,r(i)\nni ⟩}is the set of correspond-\ning concept-relation pairs. Specifically, we use the\nfollowing input format:\nQuestion: q1\nImplicit Reasoning: ⟨c(1)\n1 ,r(1)\n1 ⟩,..., ⟨c(1)\nn1 ,r(1)\nn1 ⟩\n...\nQuestion: qk\nImplicit Reasoning: ⟨c(k)\n1 ,r(k)\n1 ⟩,..., ⟨c(k)\nnk ,r(k)\nnk ⟩\nQuestion: q∗\nImplicit Reasoning:\nExample inputs are given in Appendix A. The pre-\nfixes “Question” and “Implicit Reasoning” were\nchosen arbitrarily and remained fixed throughout\nall experiments. For each test question, kexamples\nare randomly sampled from the development set,\nand for each example, a single random annotation\nis selected. In our experiments, we use k= 16.2\nModels We evaluate models from the GPT-3 fam-\nily,3 which are known to exhibit broad factual\nknowledge (Brown et al., 2020). In particular, we\nuse text-davinci-002, a 175B-parameter LM,\nwhich to the best of our knowledge was not trained\non any of the target benchmarks. Furthermore, to\nassess the scaling behaviour of models, we exper-\niment with other models from the GPT-3 family,\nsee §5.2 for details. In all experiments, outputs are\npredicted using greedy decoding.\nBaseline To account for correlations originating\nfrom the concepts that appear in the question or rea-\nsoning shortcuts, we define a ‘Concept-only’ base-\nline, where instead of testing whether the model\ncan infer the implicit relations from the full ques-\ntion, we test its ability to infer them from the set\nof gold concepts that appear in the question. For\nthis baseline, we use the same inputs as before, but\nreplace every question qi and test question q∗ with\nits set of annotated concepts.\nQuestion: qi → Question: c(i)\n1 ; ...; c(i)\nni\nWhile the identity of the gold concepts provides\nuseful information for inferring implicit relations,\n2We experimented with k ∈{8, 16, 32} but found it does\nnot dramatically change performance, see Appendix B.\n3We use the API at https://openai.com/api/.\nQuestion:     Are two cans of Campbell's Soup a day good for hypertension?\n(1) Concept \nAlignment\nSimilarity: 0.88 > 𝜏\n(2) Relation \nMatching\nSimilarity: 0.38 < 𝜏\n    \n        ⟨hypertension, nutritional causes⟩ , ⟨Campbell's Soup , ingredients⟩\n    Prediction:\n    ⟨hypertension , dietary causes⟩ , ⟨campbell's soup , sodium content⟩ \nLabels:   \nRelation match = 0.5\nAre two cans of Campbell's Soup a day good for hypertension?\n(1) Concept \nAlignment\nSimilarity: 0.88 > 𝜏\n(2) Relation \nMatching\nSimilarity: 0.38 < 𝜏\nP:\nLabels:   \nRelation coverage = 0.5\ncampbell's \nsoup\nsodium\ncontent ⟨ ⟩,hypertension dietary \ncauses ⟨ ⟩,\nCampbell's \nSoup ingredients⟨ ⟩,hypertension nutritional \ncauses⟨ ⟩,\nQ:\nG:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nFigure 3: Given predicted concept-relation pairs (P) and\ngold concept-relation pairs (G), we evaluate relations\nby aligning predicted and gold concepts using edit dis-\ntance (1), and computing the cosine similarity between\nmatched relation embeddings (2). Relation coverage is\nthe fraction of gold relations with similarity >τ (3).\nwe expect models that have access to the full ques-\ntion to perform better.\n4.2 Evaluation\nInferring implicit relations involves identifying con-\ncepts and relations. We now define evaluation met-\nrics for this task.\nConcept extraction Our output is a set of conept-\nrelation pairs. Let Cpred be the set of concepts pre-\ndicted by the LM, and let Ci\ngold be the gold set\nannotated by annotator i. Given that annotated con-\ncepts are tokens from the original question, we can\nuse edit-distance to match each predicted concept\nc ∈Cpred with a concept from Ci\ngold, declaring a\nmatch when the edit distance of the best match\nis above 0.8. Following concept matching, we\ncompute recall and precision in the typical fashion\nand take the max over all annotators. A post-hoc\nmanual analysis validated that no incorrect concept\nmatching occurred due to the use of edit distance.\nRelation coverage Since relations are short\nphrases with high lexical variability, string match-\ning is not a viable strategy. To overcome this, we\nleverage our ability to align concepts and use rela-\ntion embeddings rather than relation strings. Fig-\nure 3 depicts our evaluation procedure for two sets\nof predicted (Rpred) and annotated (Rgold) relations.\nFirst (Figure 3, step 1), we align predicted and\ngold concept-relation pairs, using the concepts (as\ndone for concept evaluation). Then (Figure 3, step\n2), we embed every relation phrase, using the sen-\ntence transformer all-mpnet-base-v2 (Reimers\nand Gurevych, 2019), and compute cosine simi-\nlarity between the embeddings of matched rela-\n2552\nSTGQA C REAK CSQA2\n# of gold pairs 1.9 1.2 1.2\n# of generated pairs 2.0 ±0.04 1 .2 ±0.02 1 .2 ±0.01\nTable 3: The mean number of concept-relation pairs in\nthe development set of each data source.

Moreover, since we use in-\ncontext learning, the average number of concept-\nrelation pairs generated is similar to the average\nnumber of gold concept-relation pairs (Table 3).\nTo set a threshold τ on relation embedding sim-\nilarity, we annotated whether a predicted relation\nis semantically equivalent to a matched gold rela-\ntion for 100 development examples. We choose\nτ = 0.51, which results in a 5% false-positive rate\n(predicting that two different relations are equiva-\nlent) and 12% false-negative rate (predicting that\ntwo equivalent relations are different). All reported\nresults are an average over three random seeds.\n5 Large LMs Can Infer Implicit Relations\nTable 4 shows results on implicit relation inference.\nFirst, the model successfully identifies the relevant\nconcepts in the question, achieving high concept\nrecall and precision across all datasets. This is\nnot limited to named entities but is also achieved\nwhen concepts are more abstract, as in CSQA2\n(Table 1). More importantly, GPT-3 infers the im-\nplicit relations well, achieving relation coverage\nscores of 0.53, 0.54, and 0.59 on STGQA, CREAK\nand CSQA2 , respectively. Moreover, a model ex-\nposed to the full question dramatically outperforms\na model exposed only to the gold concepts by 21,\n21, and 40 points on the three datasets. This in-\ndicates that concepts contain relevant information,\nbut access to the full question allows the LM to\ninfer the reasoning strategy and in turn the implicit\nrelations. We provide examples for predicted vs.\ngold concept-relation pairs along with additional\nqualitative analysis in Appendix A.\nNext, we perform additional experiments to (a)\nfurther substantiate the ability of LMs to infer im-\nplicit relations (§5.1), and (b) test the effect of\nmodel scale on performance (§5.2).\n5.1 Effect of In-Context Examples\nWhile the aforementioned results are encouraging,\nthere are two potential (non-disjoint) causes for\nthem: (a) the LM “understands” the task of im-\nplicit relation inference, or (b) the LM observes in-\ncontext examples and uses them to guess implicit\nrelations for the target question (“soft copying”).\nWe study the effect of these causes.\nSimilar vs. dissimilar in-context examples To\nquantify the effect of in-context examples, rather\nthan choosing them randomly, we use examples\nthat are similar or dissimilar to the target question\nin terms of their implicit relations.\nWe first represent each example as an embed-\nding vector, by (a) concatenating all annotated re-\nlations, i.e., r1,...,r n, and computing a vector\nrepresentation using a sentence transformer, and\n(b) averaging the embedding vectors of all annota-\ntors. Then, for each example, we select two sets of\nin-context examples: (a) Similar: the top- kmost\nsimilar examples (using cosine similarity), and (b)\nDissimilar: we discard the 33% most similar exam-\nples, and randomly sample from the rest. In both\ncases, we use gold implicit relations at test time,\nand thus this experiment is for analysis only.\nTable 5 shows relation coverage for the different\nsets of in-context examples and the fraction of cases\nwhere one of the implicit relations predicted by the\nLM is copied from the in-context examples. When\nDissimilar examples are presented, there is a slight\nperformance degradation, most notably in STGQA.\nHowever, results are still dramatically higher com-\npared to Concept-only. Moreover, the model suc-\nceeds in predicting implicit relations while hardly\n2553\nRelation Copying\nCoverage\nSTGQA\nDissimilar 0.46 ±0.01 0.01 ±0.01\nRandom 0.52 ±0.02 0.13 ±0.02\nSimilar 0.54 ±0.02 0.31 ±0.02\nConcept-only 0.28 ±0.04 0.10 ±0.04\nCREAK\nDissimilar 0.60 ±0.02 0.02 ±0.02\nRandom 0.59 ±0.03 0.08 ±0.02\nSimilar 0.67 ±0.02 0.33 ±0.03\nConcept-only 0.34 ±0.02 0.13 ±0.02\nCSQA2\nDissimilar 0.63 ±0.02 0.02 ±0.02\nRandom 0.67 ±0.01 0.07 ±0.02\nSimilar 0.73 ±0.01 0.21 ±0.03\nConcept-only 0.20 ±0.02 0.10 ±0.02\nTable 5: Development set performance. Controlling\nthe set of in-context examples with Dissimilar, Similar,\nRandom relations, and Concept-only baseline.\ncopying from in-context examples.\nIn the Similar setting, performance increases\nacross all datasets, along with a much higher rate\nof copying. This hints that designing methods for\nretrieving similar prompts can lead to gains in per-\nformance (Rubin et al., 2022).\nTo further investigate the relation between copy-\ning and performance, we label every example for\nwhether the model copies from in-context exam-\nples and the coverage of the inferred implicit rela-\ntions. We then compute the point-biserial correla-\ntion (Tate, 1954) to check if copying is correlated\nwith performance and find that correlation is low\n(<0.1 for all datasets), showing that copying does\nnot explain model performance.\nOverall, this experiment suggests that while mod-\nels can leverage examples from context to improve\nperformance, the LM does more than copy and\nexecute implicit relation inference.\nCross-dataset in-context examples If LMs can\ninfer implicit relations, we should expect high per-\nformance even when in-context examples and tar-\nget questions are taken from different datasets.\nTo test this, we evaluate performance on ques-\ntions from CREAK and CSQA2 when in-context\nexamples originate from all 3 datasets. Testing\non STGQA does not work well because the num-\nber of implicit relations in an example is typically\ntwo, while in CREAK and CSQA2 it is typically\none (see Table 3), and thus the LM output a single\nimplicit relation, leading to poor relation coverage.\nTable 6 shows that, overall, relation coverage re-\nmains high for all sources, suggesting that the LM\nindeed infers implicit relations regardless of the\nInference/Context Concept Concept Relation\nSource Recall Precision Coverage\nCREAK /STGQA 0.97 ±0.0 0.69 ±0.01 0.62 ±0.03\nCREAK /CREAK 0.93±0.02 0.91 ±0.01 0.59 ±0.03\nCREAK /CSQA2 0.93 ±0.01 0.90 ±0.02 0.60 ±0.0\nCSQA2/S TGQA 0.98 ±0.01 0.77 ±0.02 0.62 ±0.0\nCSQA2/C REAK 0.96±0.02 0.94 ±0.02 0.59 ±0.02\nCSQA2/CSQA2 0.95 ±0.01 0.96 ±0.0 0.67 ±0.01\nTable 6: Development set performance in the cross-\ndataset setup where inference on example from one\ndataset is done with in-context examples from another\ndataset.\nquestion and reasoning types in the source dataset.\nConcept recall and precision are also relatively\nstable, except when using STGQA for in-context\nexamples, since the model tends to output two\nconcept-relation pairs, reducing precision. Thus,\nthe LM is sensitive tothe number of output concept-\nrelation pairs that appear in in-context examples,\nbut succeeds in inferring implicit relations.\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\nRecent work (Kaplan et al., 2020; Smith et al.,\n2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) has shown that rea-\nsoning abilities of LMs improve with model size.\nWe evaluate this effect on models from the GPT-3\nfamily: ada, babbage, curie, and davinci, which\nare estimated to have 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B\nparameters, respectively (Gao, 2021; Black et al.,\n2022). text-davinci, the model evaluated thus\nfar, is a more recent LM that (Ouyang et al., 2022)\nwas trained differently.4\nTable 7 presents results on STGQA. Increasing\nmodel size improves relation coverage and concept\nrecall, but does not significantly change concept\nprecision. Moving from curie to davinci leads\nto a modest gain in relation coverage. Comparing\nthis to the order of magnitude difference in param-\neters between curie and davinci suggests that\ninferring implicit relations does not explain perfor-\nmance improvement in many reasoning and com-\nmonsense QA benchmarks. The smallest model,\nbabbage, tends to produce structural errors, indi-\ncating it did not properly learn the task.\n4text-davinci has 175B parameters like davinci, but\nits relation coverage on STGQA is higher: 0.43→0.52. This\nindicates that its training procedure improves inference of\nimplicit relations.\n2554\nParameters Concept Concept Relation\nRecall Precision Coverage\n350M 0.83 ±0.01 0.89 ±0.01 0.21 ±0.01\n1.3B 0.93 ±0.01 0.84 ±0.01 0.37 ±0.01\n6.7B 0.92 ±0.01 0.83 ±0.02 0.42 ±0.02\n175B 0.97 ±0.0 0.88 ±0.0 0.43 ±0.03\nTable 7: Model size and performance comparison on\nthe development set of STGQA.

Providing the gold implicit relations\ndid not contribute to model performance.\n6 Implicit Relations for QA\nGiven that LMs infer implicit relations well, a nat-\nural question is whether they improve performance\non answering implicit reasoning questions.\nTo examine this, we created three experimental\nsetups: Question + predicted: in-context examples\nare triples of the question, the implicit relations,\nand the True/False answer; the model is given a\nquestion and asked to return the implicit relations\nand the answer. Question + gold: Similar to Ques-\ntion + predicted except that the model is given\nthe target question and gold implicit relations and\nasked to return the answer. Question only: in-\ncontext examples are pairs of questions and an-\nswers, and the model is given a question and asked\nto provide the answer. We report an average over 7\nseeds. See Figure 4 for results.\nOverall, access to either gold or predicted rela-\ntions does not improve accuracy. This suggests\nthat additional capabilities are missing from LMs\nto handle implicit reasoning questions, such as\nretrieval and reasoning. This agrees with work\non chain-of-thoughts prompting (Wei et al., 2022),\nwhich found that adding an explanation of the rea-\nsoning process to a question does not improve per-\nformance on STGQA for both GPT-3 and LaMDA\n(Thoppilan et al., 2022). Nevertheless, recently\nChowdhery et al. (2022) achieved improvements\non STGQA using chain-of-thought prompting, but\nwith the larger 540B-parameter PaLM.\nOn STGQA, adding gold relations (Question +\ngold) does not improve QA performance.5 Addi-\ntionally, no significant differences were observed\nwhen the model inferred implicit relations on its\nown (Question + predicted).6 For CREAK , adding\ngold implicit relations did not improve accuracy\ncompared to Question only, and none of the experi-\nments showed any significant difference. Last, in\nCSQA2 adding gold implicit relations (Question\n+ gold) did not improve the QA performance, but\nwe observed a statistically significant accuracy im-\nprovement of 4.5% when the model inferred the\nimplicit relations (Question + predicted).7\nTo further analyze the results, we computed the\npoint-biserial correlation coefficient between the\nrelation coverage score and the binary outcome\n(correct/incorrect) for each question. We found\nthat relation coverage score and answer accuracy\nare entirely not correlated with a rpb coefficient of\n0.03, −0.02 and 0.06 for STGQA, CSQA2 and\nCREAK respectively. Overall, our results indicate\nthat inferring implicit relations correctly is not suf-\nficient to answer implicit reasoning questions.\n7 Related Work\nRecent work utilized the ability of large LMs to\ngenerate intermediate reasoning steps for improv-\ning performance on QA tasks (Wei et al., 2022;\nWang et al., 2022; Zelikman et al., 2022; Nye\net al., 2022). Wei et al. (2022) introduced ‘chain-\nof-thought’ prompting to elicit intermediate rea-\nsoning steps along with answers from LMs, which\nimproved performance on several reasoning tasks.\nConversely, we propose a task and benchmark for\nevaluating the ability of LMs to infer the interme-\ndiate reasoning steps themselves.\nPrior work has dealt with reasoning abilities in\nLMs (Talmor et al., 2020; Khashabi et al., 2020;\nGu et al., 2021) by fine-tuning LMs to generate\nadditional knowledge for reasoning questions. We\ncontribute to this effort by evaluating the in-context\nability to infer implicit relations with large LMs.\nImplicit relations are closely related to question\ndecomposition, which have been used in past work\n5paired t-test with p-value > 0.05.\n6paired t-test with p-value > 0.05.\n7paired t-test with p-value < 0.05, Cohen’s d = 1.7.\n2555\nto improve performance on questions that require\nreasoning (Min et al., 2019; Wolfson et al., 2020;\nPerez et al., 2020; Khot et al., 2021). We contribute\nto this research direction by defining implicit re-\nlations pairs, which provide a structured represen-\ntation of the decomposed sub-questions and allow\nus to examine how language models infer reason-\ning steps. Several works in narrative understand-\ning (Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Mostafazadeh et al.,\n2020; Lal et al., 2021) have attempted to assess a\nmodel’s implicit reasoning capabilities using dif-\nferent methods, such as assessing the solution path\nto unanswerable questions and and narrative under-\nstanding through question-answering. Despite their\ndifferent approaches, these studies are relevant to\nour cause.\n8 Conclusion\nWe propose the task of implicit relation inference,\nwhich decouples inference of reasoning steps from\ntheir execution. We introduce IMPLICIT RELA -\nTIONS , a benchmark that includes more than 2,000\nannotated implicit relations. We show large LMs\ncan infer implicit relations across multiple types\nof questions and reasoning skills, but this success\ndoes not translate to an improvement in answer-\ning implicit reasoning questions. Our work sheds\nlight on capabilities missing from large LMs for\naddressing implicit reasoning questions, and pro-\nvides a valuable resource for improving the ability\nof models to infer implicit relations.\nLimitations\nThis research has some limitations, which are typi-\ncal for work on text generation with large language\nmodels.\nFirst, we demonstrated that large LMs can infer\nimplicit relations from complex questions, but we\nalso showed that they may fail to answer those\nquestions correctly. It is unclear how LMs can\nuse implicit relations to improve QA accuracy or\nwhat is the path that leads from inferring implicit\nrelations to actually answering the questions.\nSecond, evaluating relation coverage requires\ncomparing to free texts, and therefore may be prone\nto error. Despite the fact that an analysis performed\nmanually exhibited a high degree of consistency\nwith the automatic one, we cannot guarantee the\nsame result for datasets or parameters that have not\nbeen tested.\nFinally, our research was conducted utilizing\nOpenAI’s GPT-3 family of models, which are not\npublicly available. Despite our best efforts to elim-\ninate confounding factors, there is a lack of trans-\nparency regarding the training methods and the data\ncomposition used for pretraining those models.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Itay Levy for useful feedback.

We sampled 50 examples\nrandomly from STGQA together with GPT-3 pre-\ndictions and manually labeled if the implicit rela-\ntions output by the model are semantically correct.\nResults in Table 8 show that our relation cover-\nage was slightly more conservative than our manual\nevaluation – 0.53 vs. 0.6. Out of the 20 examples\nthat we marked as incorrect, the automatic eval-\nuation scored 13 examples (65%) with 0 relation\ncoverage, 6 (30%) examples with partial coverage\n(scored 0.5), which indeed we included a partially\ncorrect prediction but not enough to to cover the\nneeded reasoning process. Only one example out\nof the 20 was a false positive.\nA.2 I MPLICIT RELATIONS Examples\nTables 9,10,11 present examples from each source\ndataset accompanied by the question, gold anno-\ntated implicit relation pairs, predicted pairs gener-\nated by the model and the answer to the question.\n2560\nExamples from STRATEGY QA\nQ: Could Eric Clapton’s children play a regulation game of basketball among themselves?\nG: ⟨Eric Clapton, number of children⟩, ⟨regulation game of basketball, number of players⟩\nP: ⟨eric clapton, number of children⟩, ⟨regulation game of basketball, number of players⟩\nA: False\nQ: Can you purchase General Motors products at a movie theater?\nG: ⟨General Motors, Types of products⟩, ⟨Movie theater, products sold⟩\nP: ⟨general motors, type of product⟩, ⟨movie theater, type of product⟩\nA: False\nQ: Does Rupert Murdoch’s alma mater have more history than the USA?\nG: ⟨Rupert Murdoch’s alma mater, year founded⟩, ⟨USA, year founded⟩\nP: ⟨rupert murdoch’s alma mater, date of founding⟩, ⟨usa, date of founding⟩\nA: True\nQ: Do Squidward Tentacles and Alan Greenspan have different musical passions?\nG: ⟨Squidward Tentacles, instruments played⟩, ⟨Alan Greenspan, instruments played⟩\nP: ⟨squidward tentacles, musical instrument⟩, ⟨alan greenspan, musical instrument⟩\nA: False\nQ: Is the most expensive color in the world Blue?\nG: ⟨Blue, cost of pigment⟩, ⟨most expensive color in the world, cost of pigment⟩\nP: ⟨blue, color⟩, ⟨most expensive color, color⟩\nA: True\nTable 9: Examples of gold annotations (G) and predicted (P) concept-relation pairs from IMPLICIT RELATIONS\nalong with the question (Q) and answer (A) from STRATEGY QA.\nExamples from CREAK\nQ: People celebrate Cinco de Mayo before summer starts.\nG: ⟨Cinco de Mayo, date⟩, ⟨summer, starting date⟩\nP: ⟨cinco de Mayo, date⟩\nA: True\nQ: Arthur C.
