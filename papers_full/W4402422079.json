    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction remains a cornerstone for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), influencing both route optimization and environmental efforts. While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) offer some insights into the spatial–temporal dynamics of traffic data, they’re often limited when navigating sparse and extended spatial–temporal patterns. In response, the CNN-GRUSKIP model emerges as a pioneering approach. Notably, it integrates the GRU-SKIP mechanism, a hybrid model that leverages the Gate Recurrent Unit’s (GRU) capabilities to process sequences with the ’SKIP’ feature’s ability to bypass and connect longer temporal dependencies, making it especially potent for traffic flow predictions with erratic and extended patterns. Another distinctive aspect is its non-standard 6-layer CNN, meticulously designed for in-depth spatiotemporal correlation extraction. The model comprises (1) the specialized CNN feature extraction, (2) the GRU-SKIP enhanced long-temporal module adept at capturing extended patterns, (3) a transformer module employing encoder-decoder and multi-attention mechanisms to hone prediction accuracy and trim model complexity, and (4) a bespoke prediction module. When tested against real-world datasets from California’s Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS), specifically PeMS districts 4 and 8, the CNN-GRUSKIP consistently outperformed established models such as ARIMA, Graph Wave Net, HA, LSTM, STGCN, and APTN. With its potent predictive prowess and adaptive architecture, the CNN-GRUSKIP model stands to redefine ITS applications, especially where nuanced traffic dynamics are in play.",
