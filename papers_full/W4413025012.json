Watson\nSubmitted: 1 April 2025 Revised: 21 April 2025 Accepted: 28 April 2025 Published: 8 July 2025\n1. What are Large Language Models?\nLLMs are advanced natural language processing\n(NLP) systems based on deep learning (DL) techniques\nand trained on extensive textual datasets, enabling them\nto comprehend and generate human-like language. Their\ndefining characteristics include exceptionally large param-\neter counts—ranging from billions to trillions and sophis-\nticated neural network architectures, notably the Trans-\nformer, which facilitate the capture of complex linguistic\nrelationships [1]. Increasingly, these models have been\nleveraged in healthcare settings for diverse applications,\nsuch as answering medical questions and automated gen-\neration of clinical documentation. With expanding in-\nstitutional partnerships between developers of large lan-\nguage models (LLMs) and healthcare organizations, the\npractical implementation of these models in clinical en-\nvironments is becoming progressively feasible [2]. No-\ntable examples of general LLMs include OpenAI’s Gener-\nator Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) series (GPT-3, GPT-\n4), Google’s Pathways Language Model (PaLM), Meta’s\nlarge language model meta-AI (LLaMA), and Anthropic’s\nClaude. Specialized medical LLMs, such as GatorTron,\nfurther emphasize their growing significance in medical ap-\nplications [3].\n2. Applications of LLMs in Cardiovascular\nMedicine\n2.1 Clinical Application\nThe capability of LLMs to process and analyze exten-\nsive and intricate datasets offers unprecedented opportuni-\nties for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in medicine. For ex-\nample, Brown et al. [4] utilized LLMs to incorporate so-\ncial risk factors into predictive models for assessing 30-\nday hospital readmission following acute myocardial in-\nfarction (AMI). Dewaswalaet al. [5] employed LLMs to\nanalyze cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports\nto improve the detection of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n(HCM). Their models were developed for two objectives:\n(1) to extract HCM diagnosis and (2) to extract nine cate-\ngorical concepts (such as HCM morphologic subtype, sys-\ntolic anterior motion of the mitral valve) and five numeric\nconcepts (such as maximal left ventricular (LV) wall thick-\nness, LV mass) for phenotypic classification. As a result,\ntheir LLMs achieved an accuracy of 0.99 for extraction of\nHCM diagnosis from MRI reports. For numeric concepts,\nthe accuracies were as follows: maximal LV wall thick-\nness (0.96), LV mass (0.99), LV ejection fraction (0.98),\nright ventricular ejection fraction (0.99) and LV mass index\n(0.98) [5]. In addition, these models have demonstrated ef-\nficacy in identifying adverse drug reactions and postopera-\ntive complications [6]. By augmenting the clinicians’ abil-\nities to interprete diagnostic results and generating compre-\nhensive reports, LLMs facilitate clinical decision-making.\nA practical illustration of this is the collaborative interpre-\ntation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) by cardiologists and\nLLMs using conversational interfaces [7].\nThe potential for early identification of cardiovascu-\nlar disease onset or progression through advanced analyti-\ncal techniques allows for timely initiation of preventive and\ntherapeutic interventions. Recent advancements in LLMs\nhave enabled the processing of multimodal data, includ-\ning images, thereby significantly expanding their diagnos-\ntic and predictive capabilities. The integration of ECG or\ncardiac MRI with clinical textual data has shown promise\nin enhancing risk stratification [8]. In a UK Biobank co-\nhort, LLM-based predictive models demonstrated perfor-\nmance comparable to traditional risk assessment tools in\nforecasting major adverse cardiac events within a ten-year\nperiod [9]. Additionally, LLMs can generate evidence-\nbased therapeutic recommendations and personalized med-\nication regimens by referencing comprehensive drug inter-\naction databases. Chatbot interfaces powered by LLMs\nhave been employed to continuously monitor patient recov-\nery parameters, such as pain levels and medication adher-\nence, enabling dynamic adjustments to individualized care\nplans [10].\n2.2 Education Application\nBeyond clinical applications, LLMs are increasingly\nutilized in medical education. The meta-prompt function-\nality of LLMs enables explicit definition of conversational\nroles for tailored educational experiences for medical stu-\ndents. Modes such as ‘Socratic tutor’ encourage indepen-\ndent critical thinking, provide immediate responses to stu-\ndent inquiries, and facilitate deeper understanding of com-\nplex medical concepts [11]. The demonstrated proficiency\nof LLMs on cardiology and cardiac imaging board exam-\nination questions indicates their potential as personalized\neducational tools for clinical trainees [12]. For educators,\nmultimodal LLMs offer streamlined methods for integrat-\ning and analyzing student-generated content across diverse\nformats, thereby enhancing instructional efficiency.\n2.3 Research Application\nIn academic research, LLMs hold considerable\npromise for accelerating scientific workflows. Laboratories\ncan employ these models to systematically extract critical\ninsights from extensive scientific literature, discern emerg-\ning research trends, and support experimental designs [10].\nLLMs are also poised to drive innovative investigations in\nfields traditionally considered outside the scope of textual\nanalysis, since textual representations frequently encode in-\nformation beyond human language. For instance, biologi-\ncal sequences and molecular structures, commonly docu-\nmented through textual encodings, can be effectively an-\nalyzed using NLP methodologies embedded within LLM\nframeworks [13]. Additionally, the development of ad-\nvanced LLMs facilitates the generation and application\nof synthetic data in research contexts. Detailed synthetic\ndatasets can streamline the development and validation of\nclinical decision-support tools, as well as prototype auto-\nmated research pipelines. By decoupling synthetic datasets\nfrom original patient records, these methods significantly\nmitigate privacy-related risks, thereby promoting broader\naccessibility and safer utilization of sensitive health infor-\nmation [14].\n3. Opportunities and Challenges\nLLMs exhibit transformative potential for enhancing\nclinical workflows through intelligent synthesis of multi-\nmodal patient data, including structured electronic health\nFig. 1. Technical route.LLM, large language model; CT, computed tomography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; CNN, Convolu-\ntional Neural Networks.\n2\n\nrecord (EHR) components and integrated imaging-text re-\nports. This advanced cognitive capability allows contex-\ntually informed summarization of critical clinical informa-\ntion, effectively optimizing decision-making processes and\nreducing the cognitive burdens associated with clinical doc-\numentation.\nLLMs also present opportunities to overcome acces-\nsibility constraints inherent to traditional healthcare sys-\ntems. Streamlined, cost-effective LLMs implementations\ncould notably benefit healthcare professionals operating\nwithin resource-limited environments, empowering them to\ntrain customized models tailored specifically to their clini-\ncal and research requirements. As computational demands\ndecrease, it becomes increasingly feasible to develop and\ndeploy agency-specific LLMs [2]. Moreover, the integra-\ntion of LLMs with additional multimodal data sources, such\nas medical images, biomarkers, and wearable health, moni-\ntoring devices-enables the creation of comprehensive mul-\ntimodal diagnostic and therapeutic systems, which are par-\nticularly relevant for the management of cardiovascular dis-\neases.\nNevertheless, training LLMs requires substantial vol-\numes of patient-derived clinical data, thereby mandating\nrigorous cybersecurity strategies to safeguard protected\nhealth information from unauthorized access. Implement-\ning a robust, multi-layered security framework is essential\nfor incorporating federated learning methodologies for de-\ncentralized data processing, role-based access controls with\ndetailed permission structures, and blockchain-facilitated\naudit trails ensuring cryptographic verification throughout\nthe data lifecycle. More specifically, patient privacy can\nbe safeguarded through the development of anonymization\ntools, such as deduce, spacy, or combinations of methods\n[8].\nClinical deployment of LLMs necessitates vigilance\nconcerning potential biases arising from patient demo-\ngraphic heterogeneity, including variations across gender,\nage, and race. For example, analysis of the The Can-\ncer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) cohort comprising\n8594 tumor specimens representing 33 cancer types re-\nvealed significant ethnic disparities in sample composition:\nWhite patients constituted 82.0% of cases, followed by\nBlack/African Americans (10.1%), Asians (7.5%), and de-\nmographically underrepresented populations (0.4%). Con-\nsequently, the vast majority of models are trained on\ndatasets with overrepresented European ancestry popula-\ntions, typically lacking systematic evaluation of algorith-\nmic fairness [15]. Moreover, LLMs can exhibit problematic\nbehaviors, notably generating plausible yet medically in-\naccurate outputs, including the fabrication of references to\nnonexistent scientific literature-commonly termed ‘halluci-\nnation’ [16]. For instance, hallucinations in LLMs may lead\nto erroneous associations between clinical, biological, or ra-\ndiological features and specific diseases, potentially com-\npromising diagnostic reliability. To mitigate such risks, de-\nvelopers should prioritize training models with high-quality\nand accurate data and conduct iterative testing to validate\naccuracy and quantify hallucination rates prior to clinical\ndeployment [17].\n4. Future Development of LLMs\nThe integration of multimodal architectures, which\nsynthesize textual information with cardiovascular imaging\ndata, outputs from biosensors or wearable devices, and ge-\nnomic profiles, is poised to substantially enhance the clini-\ncal applicability of LLMs. Specifically, this integration has\nthe potential for marked improvements in precise pheno-\ntypic characterization and the discovery of targeted thera-\npeutic strategies.\nProfessor Junbo Ge and his colleagues at the Zhong-\nshan Hospital, exemplified this paradigm by developing\na multimodal cardiovascular management system integrat-\ning a cardiovascular-specialized LLM pretrained on elec-\ntronic health records, clinical guidelines, and biomedi-\ncal literature, which was refined via domain-specific fine-\ntuning (Fig. 1). Complementing the LLM, their imag-\ning model employs hybrid Convolutional Neural Net-\nworks (CNN)-Transformer architectures trained on multi-\nmodal cardiac imaging (computed tomography (CT), MRI,\nechocardiography, angiography) for automated lesion de-\ntection and quantitative analysis. A reinforced learning-\ndriven multi-agent framework coordinates dynamic task al-\nlocation, cross-modal fusion, and real-time clinical decision\noptimization, delivering an intelligent, closed-loop cardiac\ncare continuum from diagnosis through long-term manage-\nment.\nWhile LLMs possess transformative potential in car-\ndiology, their integration into clinical practice necessitates\na systematic approach, emphasizing iterative optimization,\nand rigorous validation processes [11].\nAuthor Contributions\nAll authors meet all four criteria outlined in the ICMJE\nguidelines.
