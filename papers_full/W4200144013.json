    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to achieve the Economic Loading of Distribution Transformer (ELDT) based on minimizing the active energy loss. The effects of the transformer on-load and no-load losses, load factor (LF), and load loss factor (LSF) on the total energy losses are considered. The adopted technique in this paper consists of two phases, where ELDT is determined analytically in the first phase, and the load profile adequated (LSF) is statistically obtained in the second one. The results declare that the proposed technique is suitable for the shifts system mode of operation such as in industrial plants. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of the total active and reactive power and energy losses on ELDT. Finally, numerical examples with software analyses are performed as a valuable tool, which supports the decision-makers to decide trustfully the size of the transformer and its capacity (kVA) during the design stage, as well as to determine the economic loading during the operation based on the effective factors, that is, total power, energy losses, and the load profile.",
