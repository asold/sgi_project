INTRODUCTION\nL\nEVERAGING the high voltage and high-speed capabil-\nity of emerging wide band gap semiconductor devices,\nmedium-voltage (MV) solid state transformer (SST) is gaining\nwidespread applications in medium-voltage dc (MVdc) distri-\nbution, renewable energy collection, and fast charging stations.\nMedium-frequency (MF) transformer is crucial in an MV SST\nconverter architecture to achieve galvanic isolation, high power\ndensity, and high efﬁciency.\nOne primary design challenge of MF transformer is to imple-\nment desired insulation at MV pulsewidth modulation (PWM)\nexcitation without compromising on power density and efﬁ-\nciency. Onset of partial discharge (PD) is an indication of in-\nsulation issues in ac systems. Every discharge event reduces the\ninsulation lifetime by degrading the insulation material leading\nto premature insulation failure.\nResearch works in [1] and [2] designed MF frequency trans-\nformers for inductor tank based MV dc SST with PWM fre-\nquency from 3 to 20 kHz. The insulation material of the windings\nis presented but the insulation performance remains untested.\nZhao et al.in [3] designed a 500-kHz transformer with PTFE\npolymer based insulation that has been characterized up to\n30 kV with short impulse voltage testing. Guoet al.developed\na 200-kW, 15-kHz dual active bridge SST MF transformer in\n[4] with PD characterization up to 7.5 kV peak. The PD test is\nperformed at 60 Hz sine ac voltage bearing different properties\ncompared to PWM voltage. It is reported in [5] that PD is\nheavily inﬂuenced by the voltage shape and PWM voltage with\nswitching transients show stronger PD activity compared to sine\nand triangle voltages. The PDs research for motor windings\nunder actual PWM excitation at greater than 60 Hz frequency has\nbeen reported in [6]–[9]. However, the research of PWM effects\non PD of MF transformer within SST has not been reported.\nThe PD characteristics in SST transformer are different from\nthat of motor winding because of difference in PWM voltage,\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

SST transformer windings are subjected to\ngreater potential difference and faster alternating electric ﬁelds\nbetween the primary and secondary side of the transformer as\na consequence of phase-shift modulation and high switching\nfrequency of SST.\nMF transformer is important for dc SST’s reliability since\nwinding insulation failure can lead to short circuit fault between\nthe high voltage and low voltage side. A survey of the literature\nsuggests that degradation of dielectric material is affected by PD\nactivity and the life expectancy is substantially reduced in the\npresence of PD [10]. Singhet al.[11] experimentally evaluated\nthe lifetime of high-voltage direct current (HVdc) converter’s\nline frequency transformer insulation under different ac voltage\nwaveform patterns. The results show that insulation lifetime\ndepends drastically on waveform pattern reducing the lifetime\nto less than one year for square voltage pattern, whereas the\nlifetime is greater than 40 years for sinusoidal voltage. They\nhave performed accelerated breakdown (BD) tests on oil in paper\ninsulation material but have not characterized the material for\nPDs. Insulation lifetime is heavily dependent on ac frequency\nprimarily due to the repetitive nature of PD events following\nthe rise and fall of alternating voltage. However, the PD effects\non transformer lifetime have not been studied in [11]. Laghari\nand Cygan [12] show that the lifetime of polyimide Kapton\nﬁlm insulation is signiﬁcantly reduced when ac frequency is\nincreased to 400 Hz from 60 Hz. The failure mechanism and\nmethod for failure assessment have not been reported for MF\nPWM transformers.\nThis article studied the effect of PWM with high dv/dt\nswitching transients on PD and lifetime characteristics of an\nMF transformer for MV SST especially when SiC devices are\napplied. The tightly packed MF transformer windings carry-\ning high-frequency PWM voltages with highdv/dt are more\nprone to PDs, which may lead to premature transformer fail-\nure leading to dc SST down-time. Hence, characterization of\nPDs and lifetime of transformer winding insulation at precise\ngeometry and PWM voltage excitation is important. This article\npresents a nonintrusive PD characterization strategy for foil-type\nMF transformer under high-frequency PWM waveform using\nhigh-speed optical sensors. Kapton (polyimide) insulated foil\nwindings are stressed with steady state PWM voltages up to\n2 kV and frequencies up to 50 kHz with high dv/dt up to\n60 V/ns while maintaining the transformer’s geometric proﬁle.\nThe interwinding PD inception and extinction characteristics for\nfoil-type MF transformer are obtained, which provides an insight\nof transformer lifetime. Additionally, an extended transformer\nlifetime model considering PWM frequency and switchingdv/dt\nis developed from accelerated winding BD tests. The model\nderives a mathematical relationship of switching frequency and\nswitching speed inﬂuence on SST transformer’s lifetime.\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. Section II\npresents the dc SST topology along with foil-type MF trans-\nformer construction. Interwinding peak potential state unique\nto phase-shift modulated dc SST is analyzed and electric ﬁeld\nﬁnite-element analysis (FEA) simulation results indicating 5×\nelectric ﬁeld enhancement between the primary and secondary\nwinding are discussed in detail. In Section III, the transformer\nPD characterization methodology is addressed in detail with\nSiC-based variable frequency anddv/dt voltage generator. Based\non optical detection method, the PD inception voltage (PDIV)\nand PD extinction voltage (PDEV) are characterized for wide\nspectrum of PWM frequency between 10 Hz and 50 kHz. Post\nPD characterization, the foil windings are stress tested at 2 kV\nPWM until BD for frequencies between 10 and 50 kHz anddv/dt\nof 30 and 60 V/ns. The ﬁndings are presented in Section IV.\nBased on the BD results, lifetime models are developed with\nvarying frequency for a ﬁxed dv/dt. Effect of dv/dt is quan-\ntitatively represented in the mathematical models. Extended\ntransformer lifetime model considering switching frequency\nand dv/dt is also discussed in Section IV. Finally, Section V\nconcludes this article.\nII. SST C\nONFIGURA TION ANDTRANSFORMER INSULA TION\nDISCUSSION\nThe dc grid technology is a promising solution to integrate a\nlarge amount of renewable energies and energy storage systems.\nAt the transmission level, the HVdc is an emerging technology\nto integrate large renewable power plants. At the distribution\nlevel, MVdc grids are promising for the efﬁcient connection\nof distributed renewable generation and storage systems. The\ndc SST that interconnects MVdc distribution grids and HVdc\ntransmission grids therefore plays a key role in such dc grids.\nFig. 1shows a dc transformer to connect MVdc distribution grids\nand HVdc transmission grids using phase-shifted modulation\nmethod. The power transfer is controlled by adjusting the phase\nshift angle between the primary and secondary voltages of an\nMF transformer. The primary and secondary voltages of MF\ntransformer are also shown inFig. 1.\nA peak potential state is created between the primary and\nsecondary side transformer windings during the duration of\nphase shift. In the modulation shown inFig. 1, φ =4 5\n◦ is\nconsidered for simplicity. For this application, the MF trans-\nformer is designed for a unity turns ratio. Hence, the peak\ninterwinding potential (V\nIWP) reaches 2×the dc-link voltageVdc\nfor the duration of phase-shift in the positive half cycle between\n0 and Tφ, mathematically represented by the following equation:\nVIWP = |Vpri −n·Vsec|. (1)\nIdeally, between Tφ and Ts/2, both primary voltage Vpri\nand secondary voltageVsec are at same potential due to trans-\nformer turns ratio n =1 , making VIWP hold zero potential\ndifference. At Ts/2, the negative half cycle begins, again in-\ncreasing VIWT to 2 ·Vdc between Ts/2 and (Ts/2+ Tφ). Hence,\nthe winding-to-winding voltage constitutes of unipolar square\nwave bearing twice the switching frequency of transformer\nPWM voltage, width equal to the operating phase-shift angle\nand two times amplitude of switching transients. The fast al-\nternating electric ﬁeld between the tightly packed transformer\nwindings signiﬁcantly increases the stress on posterior edges of\nthe windings and creates favorable conditions for PD inception\nas well as to accelerated insulation aging due to PD activity.\nPD can happen either between microvoids with the winding\nAGARWAL et al.: EFFECTS OF PWM WITH HIGHdv/dt ON P ARTIAL DISCHARGE AND LIFETIME OF MF TRANSFORMER 3859\nFig. 1. SST architecture with two-level PWM voltage.\nFig. 2. Foil-type MF transformer construction.\nor between the posterior insulation surfaces of primary and\nsecondary side windings. Therefore, the interwinding insulation\nis challenging for phase-shifted operation based dc SST due to\nthe peak potential state. The intrawinding insulation between\ntwo adjacent layers and the winding to core insulation is also\nprone to PD inception, whereas the potential difference in both\ncases is smaller than interwinding potential difference; hence,\nthe focus of this work is on interwinding insulation.\nAn MF transformer with nanocrystalline core and copper foil\nwindings is designed for a dc SST with phase-shifted operation\nto achieve high power density and low loss [13]–[15]. The\ntransformer is structured in a UU shape with separate wind-\ning structure, as shown inFig. 2. The windings are insulated\nwith Kapton (polyimide) insulation because the mechanical\nproperties of Kapton allow it to bend freely compared to other\ninsulation materials. This allows better control over foil winding\nconstruction, combined with thin insulation thickness improves\nthe coupling of transformer.\nSeparate winding structure may suffer from higher leakage\ninductance due to lower magnetic coupling as compared to\nconcentric or interleaved winding structures [4]; the separate\nstructure however exhibits the best interwinding insulation due\nto natural separation between the primary and secondary sides,\noften aided by a small air gap. On the other hand, in interleaved\nwinding structure, the gap between the primary and secondary\nside winding is minimized by directly interleaving the primary\nand secondary winding foil layers on top of each other to enhance\nthe magnetic coupling. Interleaving creates the peak potential\nstate throughout the winding length due to continuous close\nproximity of primary and secondary conductors wound together\nwith no air-gap to support the dielectric strength. Consequently,\nthe entire winding bulk is vulnerable to PD in interleaved struc-\nture, whereas only the anterior edge facing the other winding\nis prone to PD in separate winding structure. Hence, a separate\nwinding structure is adopted for this work.\nFor transformer winding structure, PD inception depends on\nthe electric ﬁeld and dielectric strength between primary and\nsecondary conductors. Electric ﬁeld intensity is associated with\nthe geometry and proximity of conductors carrying mismatched\nelectric potential. The interwinding electric ﬁeld severity is an-\nalyzed using 2-D axisymmetric FEA simulation on a simpliﬁed\nwinding structure, which consists of one layer of Kapton insula-\ntion with adhesive silicone backing over 2 mil thick copper foil.\nThe thickness of silicone and Kapton is 1 mil each. The relative\npermittivity of Kapton is 3.4 and that of silicone adhesive as 2.8.\nIn this simulation, the primary side copper winding potential is\nset to 2 kV and the secondary side is set to 0 V to be consistent\nwith experimental condition for PD evaluation. 0.2 mm gap\ndistance in air represents a densely packed transformer with\nmaximum ﬁll factor. The zoom-in simulation results inFig. 3\nshow 4×–5×electric ﬁeld enhancements along the entire lateral\nedge of the primary and secondary windings. This can lead to\n3860 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 70, NO. 4, APRIL 2023\nFig. 3. FEA simulation results of the anterior winding edge with one\nlayer of Kapton insulation.\nPD inception at lower than anticipated dc-link voltages leading\nto unexpected transformer insulation failure. The simulation\nalso demonstrates the edge effect predominantly enhancing the\nelectric ﬁeld at the ﬁlleted edge of the winding. Such sharp\nedges are a common occurrence formed during the bending\nand shaping process of copper metal. In addition,∼2× ﬁeld\nenhancement between copper, adhesive, and Kapton creating\nfavorable PD condition within the microcavities between the\nmaterial layers.\nIt is important to note that fast alternating electrical ﬁeld is cre-\nated by the fast switching PWM voltage of the MF transformer\nalong with the electric ﬁeld enhancement leading to signiﬁcant\nPD activity between the micro cavities as well as between the\nwindings. In addition, the dielectric losses and unexpected local\ntemperature rise can be expected owing to MF PWM pulses.\nThe fast dv/dt, fast switching frequency along with switching\ntransients can drastically reduce the lifetime of insulation in\nSST; the weakest point being the MF transformer interwind-\ning insulation because it is usually designed to withstand the\npeak PWM voltage occurring in SST. Therefore, it is crucial\nto evaluate the PWM effects on PD between the interwinding\ninsulation for MF transformer. In the following section, the in-\nterwinding PD is experimentally characterized under fast PWM\nvoltages.\nIII. T\nRANSFORMER PD CHARACTERIZA TIONWITH VARIABLE\nSWITCHING FREQUENCY AND HIGH DV/DT\nPD detection methods can be classiﬁed into electrically\ncoupled methods and nonintrusive methods. Electrically cou-\npled methods include the traditional coupling capacitor method\nwhere the PD activity is obtained by measuring the PD dis-\nplacement current off a coupled capacitor to the specimen under\ntest. While this method is standardized in the IEC 60270 [16]\nfor 50/60 Hz ac PD measurement, it is unsuitable for higher\nfrequency PWM PD measurements. Another method is ground\ncurrent measurement using high frequency current transformer\n[17]; while this method exhibits good performance irrespective\nof voltage waveform shape, it suffers from severe interference\ndue to switching inrush currents. For PWM waveform, the\ninrush current overlaps the PD signal making it hard to identify.\nOn the other hand, the nonintrusive methods include optical\ndetection using photomultiplier tube (PMT) [8], electromagnetic\ndetection using ultra high frequency antenna [18], as well as\nacoustic and electrochemical detection using ultrasound and\nozone sensors. Acoustic and electrochemical detection method\nis based on secondary-response detection and is too slow for\nprecise PD detection. Electromagnetic detection satisﬁes the\ndetection speed requirement but the high-speed switching elec-\ntromagnetic interference (EMI) interferes with the PD signal\nrequiring extensive postprocessing to separate PD from noise. In\nmany cases, especially at PDIV and PDEV , PD signals contain\nlower amplitude than EMI noise, which remains undetectable\npost signal processing.\nThe optical detection method using PMT is fully isolated from\nelectrical disturbances. Since light is a compulsory byproduct of\nPD and is the fastest form of energy, PMT-based PD detection\nsatisﬁes the detection speed and sensitivity requirements for\nMF power electronic applications. Additionally, no postpro-\ncessing of data is required, which makes it easy and compact.\nThe PD characterization system for foil-type MF transformer\nis developed and shown inFig. 4 where it consists of three\nmain parts: 1) MF PWM generator, which is the source of\nPWM potential between the primary and secondary windings; 2)\ntransformer winding test setup, which is built to hold windings\nunder test maintaining the transformer’s geometry; and 3) optical\nPD measuring instrument, which detects the optical photons\ndischarged during PD event and converts it into electrical signal\nfor acquisition. Each subcomponent is described in detail as\nfollows.\n1) MF PWM Generator: The PWM generator is shown in\nFig. 4(b), which is a half-bridge inverter using discrete\n3.3-kV SiC MOSFETs from GeneSiC. The maximum\ndc-link voltage is selected as 2 kV . Optically isolated\ngate drivers with desat protection drive the MOSFETs to\nswitching frequencies up to 50 kHz, generating unipolar\nPWM output. The PWM frequency is varied between\n10 Hz and 50 kHz. The dv/dt is limited by the par-\nasitic capacitance associated with the winding sample\nand the parasitic inductance of the external current lim-\niting resistance inserted between the PWM generator\nand the winding test sample. Peakdv/dt of 60 V/ns is\nachieved by the circuit. A second test case is attained\nby dropping thedv/dt to 30 V/ns by modifying the gate\nresistance.\n2) Transformer Winding Test Setup: The detailed design pa-\nrameters of this foil-type MF transformer were presented\nin [14]. A winding test setup is custom built in the lab with\nﬁberglass G-10 insulating material. Since intrawinding\nturn-to-turn insulation is not the focus of this work, the\ncustom test setup shown inFig. 4(c) holds one layer of\nprimary and one layer of secondary winding on each side\nwhile maintaining the geometry of real transformer. The\nwinding sample is constructed witha2m i lt h i c kcopper\nfoil [19] shaped and layered with 3M 1093 Kapton insu-\nlation consisting of around 1 mil thick adhesive silicone\nbacking and 1 mil of polyimide Kapton insulation.

PMT can detect faint\noptical signals and the large active lens area makes it\nideal to catch the scattered light from the source [20].\nHence, PMT provides high sensitivity and fast response\ntime that is required to optically detect PDs. In addition,\noptical PD detection is a noninvasive technique requiring\nno physical voltage and current measurements from the\ncircuit. This makes it naturally immune to the switching\nartifacts produced by the fast switching power electronics\ncircuit. Hence, PD detection is possible by visualizing the\nraw data with no postprocessing required. Utmost care\nshould be taken to ensure that the test area is light-free\nwith no external sources of light that can add noise to the\nmeasurement. The optical PD measurements are validated\nby comparing them with the PD measurements obtained\nT ABLE I\nTEST CASES USED FOR PD CHARACTERIZA TION\nby Heaﬂy coupling capacitor based PD detector at 60 Hz.\nConsistent results are obtained by both methods validat-\ning the authenticity of PMT-based optical PD detection.\nThe experimental testbed is shown in Fig. 4(d).T h et e s t\nis performed inside the Faraday cage facility to isolate the\ntest circuit from switching noise and other background noises\nproduced by the PWM source. Faraday cage is equipped with\ndedicated climate control equipment that maintains consistent\nambient conditions of 22 °C and 28% relative humidity. The\ngrounded Faraday cage is built with solid steel on all six faces of\nthe room, which also provides an optical noise-free environment\nfor accurate PD detection. PMT is placed vertically facing\nthe adjacent edges of the primary and secondary side winding\nsamples and PWM voltage excitation is given to the primary\nwinding. The distance between PMT lens and winding sample\nis kept at approximately 6 in. The voltage across the winding\nis measured with a high-speed differential voltage probe. The\nvoltage measurement is plotted against the output of the PMT\nto identify PD along the voltage waveform. The voltageV\nTr is\nplotted against the ground currentIBD during accelerated life\ntests. The data are visualized on an oscilloscope with 1 GHz\nbandwidth placed outside the Faraday cage. Common mode\nchokes are placed in between the long measurement leads to\nﬁlter the radiated EMI noise generated by the fast switching SiC\nMOSFETs of the PWM generator at the rising and falling edges\nof the PWM voltage. The secondary side winding specimen\nis grounded in order to create a unipolar peak potential state\nidentical to phase-shift modulated dc SST.\nPD characterization experiments were performed on foil\nwinding specimens under varying PWM frequency. The test\nscenarios are listed inTable I. For each test case, the frequency is\nkept constant and the voltage of the PWM generator is increased\nprogressively until light photons are detected by the PMT. The\nvoltage across the winding specimen and the PMT output voltage\nare recorded in a mixed signal oscilloscope for real-time visual-\nization. The presence of light (discharge) is indicated by the PMT\nby its characteristic negative voltage pulses. PMT measurements\n3862 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 70, NO. 4, APRIL 2023\nFig. 5. PDIV measurement results withdv/dt = 30 V/ns at: (a) 10 kHz PWM frequency and (b) 50 kHz PWM frequency.\nexhibit the periodic nature of discharge that is aligned with the\nrising and falling edge of the PWM voltage pulse, thus proving\nthat the measured light is PD. The MF PWM generator voltage\nat which PD incepts is recorded as PDIV .\nPDIV measurements at 10 kHz PWM and 50 kHz PWM with\ndv/dt of 30 V/ns are shown inFig. 5(a) and (b), respectively.\nThe pulsed output of PMT aligns with the rising and falling\nedges of the voltage waveform indicating the presence of PD\nactivity at the ﬁrst quadrant and third quadrant of the ac wave.\nPD pattern in the ﬁrst and third quadrant of the ac waveform is\na typical characteristic in ac waveforms due to space charge\naccumulation. The specimen is held at a voltage marginally\ngreater than PDIV for short duration then the PWM generator\nvoltage is progressively decreased until no PD is detected by\nthe PMT. The voltage at which PD extinguishes is recorded as\nPDEV . This implies that once PDIV is reached, PD activity will\ncontinue until the dc SST system voltage is reduced to reach\nPDEV . It should be noted that for each test case, fresh winding\nspecimens are tested until three congruent results are obtained.\nPremature PD activity was observed in bad samples containing\nair pocket defects; hence, they were eliminated from the study.\nThe correlation of PD characteristics with switching fre-\nquency is derived by increasing the switching frequency of test\nwaveforms. It should be noted that the tests were performed at\neight different PWM frequencies and twodv/dt cases, as listed\nin Table I. All the tests were performed in climate controlled\nlab area with ambient temperature averaging to25\n◦C and at\nnormal atmospheric pressure. More than three fresh samples\nwere identically fabricated and tested for each case. The ﬁrst\ntest case is PWM frequency of 10 Hz. The dc-link voltage of\nthe MF generator was progressively increased in increments of\n25 V and the specimen is held at each voltage for a few seconds\nbefore the progressive increase. The voltage is increased until PD\nis detected by the PMT and the voltage is recorded as PDIV . The\nred curve inFig. 6represents PDIV test results. The PDIV for\nsub kilo-hertz PWM frequencies is found higher than kilo-hertz\nfrequencies. At 10 kHz and above frequencies, the PDIV is 25%\nlower than PDIV at 100 Hz. Moreover, beyond 10 kHz, PDIV\nFig. 6. PDIV and PDEV as a function of PWM frequency withdv/dt =\n30 V/ns.\nshows negligible dependence on PWM frequency. On one side,\nthe shape of voltage waveform inﬂuences the distribution of\nvoltage with the winding sample. On the other, the fast switching\npotential difference with switching transients inﬂuence the dis-\ncharge physics at microscopic levels within the same conductor\nas well as between two adjacent conductors. Hence, marginal\ndependence of PDIV on switching frequency is observed when\ncomparing the results of sub kilo-hertz low PWM frequencies\nwith tens of kilo-hertz frequency. This can be explained by\nCole-Cole model [21] that describes the inverse relationship of\ndielectric permittivity with frequency. However, state-of-the-art\ndc SST’s MF transformer withstands PWM frequencies between\n10 and 50 kHz, where PDIV shows no dependence on PWM\nfrequency.\nPDEV can be up to 35% below PDIV [22]; hence, the MF\ntransformer should be designed in a such way that its abso-\nlute peak operating voltage is always below PDEV so that the\ndischarges that are incepted during a temporary over voltage\nare deﬁnitely quenched at the restored operating voltage. To\nmeasure PDEV , the test sample is held at a voltage higher than\nPDIV , a value greater than 25% over PDEV is used in this\ncase and then the dc-link voltage is progressively decreased\nAGARWAL et al.: EFFECTS OF PWM WITH HIGHdv/dt ON P ARTIAL DISCHARGE AND LIFETIME OF MF TRANSFORMER 3863\nat 5–10 V intervals until the pulsed output of PMT disappears\nand VPMT =0 against Vtr. It should be noted that whenVTr\nreaches close to PDEV , the strength of the discharge decreases\nconsiderably, which is exhibited by the lower amplitude and\nwidth of the PD pulses measured by the PMT. The PD activity\nalso becomes aperiodic. PDEV is the voltage at which PD\nis completely extinguished. Therefore, PDEV is recorded at\nthe dc-link voltage where no PD is detected by the PMT for\nmore than a minute. The blue curve inFig. 6represents PDEV\ntest results. Identical ratio between PDIV and PDEV values is\nobtained for all test cases. It is noted that the PDIV and PDEV\nin Fig. 6are measured without considering the voltage ringing\neffect. This is due to the fact that voltage ringing can be limited\nby design.\nTwo dv/dt cases of 30 and 60 V/ns have been tested for PDIV\nand PDEV at PWM frequencies between 10 Hz and 50 kHz for\nboth dv/dt. No variation in measured quantities was observed\nduring the test that exhibits that PD characteristics are indepen-\ndent of testeddv/dt in PWM waveform. An explanation to this\nbehavior is linked with the PWM waveform shape where voltage\ncommutation is naturally fast due to steep voltage rising and\nfalling edges. Although the change ofdv/dt f r o m3 0t o6 0V / n s\nis signiﬁcant from the semiconductor standpoint despite that, it\nwas not enough to generate a difference in PD characteristics.\nIt is crucial to understand the PD characteristics of MF trans-\nformer windings because each PD event degrades the insulation\nmaterial. In doing so, it considerably reduces the lifetime of the\nMF transformer. Since PD event is a function of switching fre-\nquency, the lifetime of the transformer is inversely proportional\nto the switching frequency. The following section highlights the\nlifetime characteristics of MF transformer.\nIV . L\nIFETIME MODEL DEVELOPMENT\nEach PD event degrades the insulation and reduces the\nlifetime. The winding specimen was subjected to repetitive\nPD, which degraded insulation material, creating an electric\narc ﬂashover through a pinhole defect on the surface of the\ninsulation.\nTo study the lifetime characteristics of Kapton insulated foil\nwinding, dielectric BD (life) tests were performed in the lab. Five\nswitching frequencies between 10 and 50 kHz are selected with\ntwo dv/dt cases of 30 and 60 V/ns to maintain consistency with\nthe PD characteristics measurement. Thisdv/dt and frequency\ncombination is adequate for SiC enabled dc SST. Test setup\nshown in Fig. 4(a) has already been discussed in the previous\nsection; hence, it will not be discussed again in this section. For\neach data point, more than three samples are tested to identify\nand avoid stochasticity in hand-made winding samples.\nThe winding sample is stress tested at square ac peak voltage\n2 kV by maintaining the input voltage until dielectric BD occurs.\nThe dielectric BD test is performed in the presence of PDs since\nthe test voltage is beyond PDIV as tested in the previous section.\nThe ac voltage is plotted on the oscilloscope by measuringV\nTr .\nWhen dielectric BD occurs, the voltage insulation between the\nprimary and secondary side no longer exists, which can be ob-\nserved by the sudden fall of measured voltageV\ntr.At this instant,\na voltage difference is created at the current limiting resistance\nRext inserted between the half-bridge and the windings. This\nresistance limits the short circuit current toVBD/Rext to a safe\nvalue for the semiconductor device. At the same time, desat\nprotection activates and ceases the switching action to protect\nthe circuit from an arc fault. Activation of desat protection\nobserved with the rise in measured currentI\nBD is an indication\nof a dielectric BD of winding insulation. The test is repeated for\neach operating point with new samples until three homogenous\nBD times are achieved. Broken down winding samples are tested\nunder a microscope to assess the damage and identify the pinhole\nBD spot that remains unnoticeable by naked eye. The magnitude\nof damage remains small due to negligible current ﬂow in the\ntest circuit. The BD energy will increase when the transformer\nwinding is loaded with current.\nThe electrical measurements obtained at the BD instant for 10\nkHz PWM frequency are shown inFig. 7(a)and for 50 kHz PWM\nfrequency inFig. 7(b). It should be noted that BD occurs either\nduring the rising edge of the voltage, shown inFig. 7(b),o ri n\nbetween the peak voltage level, shown inFig. 7(a). This behavior\nis due to the unipolar nature of the PWM potential difference\napplied at the MF transformer winding sample, which enhances\nthe electric ﬁeld between the primary and secondary winding\nduring the ﬁrst and second quadrants of the ac waveform. During\nthe third and fourth quadrants, the electric ﬁeld decreases at the\nbeginning of the third quadrant and increases only when the next\nac cycle begins.\nThe BD times obtained for each test case are plotted inFig. 8.\nFrom the plot, it is evident that dielectric BD is highly dependent\non the ac frequency and follows an inversely proportional rela-\ntionship with ac frequency. The BD time is signiﬁcantly shorter\nfor 50 kHz ac frequency as compared to 10 kHz ac. The test is\nrepeated for two rise and falldV/dT condition: 30 and 60 V/ns.\nMF transformer lifetime models are developed from the obtained\ntest results, which will be discussed in the following sections.\nThe lifetime test results obtained for ac PWM frequency of\n10–50 kHz are utilized to derive a lifetime model for foil-type\ntransformers that can extrapolate the lifetime of the winding\nspecimen at a desired ac frequency by using one experimentally\nobtained lifetime test data as reference as shown in (2), where\nL\nfn is lifetime at PWM frequencyn; Lref stands for the measured\nlifetime at a reference frequency;fref is the reference frequency\nat whichLref is measured;fn is the PWM frequency of interest to\ncalculate lifetime; andk is the experimentally derived constant\nthat is dependent ondv/dt of PWM waveform. Similar lifetime\nmodel has been derived in [10] for motor windings. The derived\nmodel shows good conﬁdence extrapolating the lifetime of foil\nwinding at any desired frequencies by using one experimentally\nobtained lifetime at set operating conditions as reference\nLfn = Lref ∗\n(fref\nfn\n)k\n. (2)\nInsulation life heavily depends on the PWM frequency and\nfollows an inverse relationship. The alternating electric ﬁelds\nimpart stress on the insulation material. If the applied voltage is\nbeyond PDIV , there will be inception and extinction of PDs in\n3864 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 70, NO. 4, APRIL 2023\nFig. 7. Dielectric BD test waveforms withdv/dt = 60 V/ns. (a) 10 kHz PWM frequency. (b) 50 kHz PWM frequency.\nFig. 8. BD test results for varying PWM frequency anddv/dt.\neach ac cycle. Hence, the number of PD events in a unit time is\nproportional to the PWM frequency. This means that at higher\nPWM frequency, there will be more PD events in a unit time\ncompared to a lower PWM frequency. As a consequence, at\nhigh frequency, the insulation material will suffer from higher\ndegradation due to PD than at low PWM frequency. As a result\nof dielectric degradation due to PD, fastest BD is observed at\n50 kHz during the test.\nAdditionally, the exponent of the frequency rational termk\nvaries withdv/dt because BD is dependent on switching speed\nas well. The exponent of frequency rational term is obtained by\ncurve ﬁtting of experimentally obtained BD times. The calcu-\nlated values arek = 1.25 fordv/dt of 30 V/ns andk = 1.4 fordv/dt\nof 60 V/ns. This establishes that the BD characteristics for the\ntransformer winding are dependent on both switching frequency\nand switching speed. Faster switching speeds will negatively\nimpact the MF transformer lifetime. Hence, an extended model\nis developed in the following section that considers the effect of\nPWM frequency anddv/dt.\nUnlike PDIV , switching speed impacts the BD endurance of\nKapton insulated foil winding. In Fig. 8, the magenta curve\nplots the results obtained at 30 V/ns switching speeds and the\nblue curve plots 60 V/ns switching speed. The test results for\n30 V/ns show slightly better dielectric BD endurance than the\nfaster 60 V/ns case. In the previous section, lifetime model is\nFig. 9. Experimental lifetime test results atdv/dt = 30 V/ns (magenta\nbars); experimental lifetime test results atdv/dt = 60 V/ns (blue bars);\nextrapolated lifetime test atdv/dt = 30 V/ns from model (dotted red);\nextrapolated lifetime test atdv/dt = 60 V/ns from model (dotted green).\nderived for varying PWM frequency at a ﬁxeddV/dT.T h ee x -\nperiment results conclude the dependence of insulation lifetime\non switching speed, which is factored into the model with the\nexponential constant of the switching frequency rational. Based\non the experimental data, an extended lifetime model is derived\nas shown in (3). This model is an extension of (2) and accounts\nfor change in PWM frequency as well as effect ofdv/dt.T h e\nextended model is obtained by curve ﬁtting of experimental BD\ndata and this model is used to extrapolate the lifetime inFig. 9\nusing 10 kHz as f\nref and experimentally obtained lifetime at\ndv/dt = 30 V/ns asLref\nLfn ,dV/dTn = Lref\n(fref\nfn\n)1.25(dv/dtref\ndv/dtn\n) fn\n128\n. (3)\nThe model is then used to extrapolate the lifetime at 20–50\nkHz for switching speed of 30 V/ns and 10–50 kHz for 60 V/ns.\nThe presented extrapolation boundary is between 10 and 50 kHz\nbecause that is the range of experimental test data that is used\nfor model validation. The model tolerance is within 17% of the\nexperimental data where the highest deviation observed from the\n30 kHz test data. For the other frequencies, the model prediction\nlies within the experimental error boundaries, thus proving the\nAGARWAL et al.: EFFECTS OF PWM WITH HIGHdv/dt ON P ARTIAL DISCHARGE AND LIFETIME OF MF TRANSFORMER 3865\neffectiveness of the extended lifetime model for foil-type MF\ntransformers. The effect of peak PWM voltage is not considered\nbecause of the inability to obtain experimental results at greater\nthan 2 kV dc-link voltages. This is because the PWM source is\nbuilt using 3.3 kV device.\nV. CONCLUSION\nNovel ﬁndings on PD characteristics for a foil-type trans-\nformer constructed with Kapton insulation over copper foil were\npresented in this article. PDIV and PDEV were characterized\nfor PWM frequencies between 10 Hz and 50 kHz. PDIV and\nPDEV values were about 18% higher for PWM frequencies less\nthan 1 kHz. PD characteristics were found to have negligible\ndependence ondv/dt for the twodv/dt test cases.\nDielectric BD experiments were also performed in the lab\nwith varying switching frequency and switching speed and\naccelerated BD tests were performed in the presence of PD.\nLifetime of Kapton insulated foil winding exhibits negative\nexponential relationship with switching frequency anddv/dt.\nTransformer lifetime models were derived for varying frequency\nfrom empirically obtained test results and a uniﬁed lifetime\nmodel considering the effect of frequency and switching speed\nwas also developed. The derived models serve as baseline for MF\ntransformer lifetime estimation, real-time health monitoring, as\nwell as accelerated lifetime testing for dc SSTs. The derived\nmodels provide valuable lifetime information that can support\nconverter optimization to achieve best efﬁciency, power density,\nand reliability. Future work will continue to improve the insula-\ntion design to obtain PD free operation at highdv/dt MF PWM.\nThe obtained lifetime model considers two electrical factors:\nfrequency and dv/dt. Future work is also targeted to enhance\nthe lifetime model by including the effect of voltage stress to\nidentify the dominating factor in PD inception and winding BD.\nThe effect of ambient conditions will also be studied along with\nwinding to core insulation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
