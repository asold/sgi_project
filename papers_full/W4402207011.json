The authors conclude by \ndescribing the application of this type of support in teacher preparation pro-\ngrams and a vision of the future of using AI agents in instruction. \nKEYWORDS      \nArtificial intelligence, biometric, computer science, disability, \nspecial education, teacher education\nA\ns Artificial intelligence (AI) technology advances, researchers are \nincreasingly adopting these new methodologies, particularly in student \nlearning systems, which is leading to the development of automated \nadaptive learning as a standard feature in intelligent tutoring systems. \nAn AI or intelligent agent is a software entity that perceives its environment and \ntakes actions to achieve specific goals. These agents operate autonomously, making \ndecisions based on data and predefined programmed algorithms. They utilize AI \ntechniques to interact with the environment. The benefit of an AI agent in the class-\nroom is its autonomy in taking action without the support of humans. An important \naspect when preparing teachers to use AI agents is the social capacity of students to \nbond with the agent and the potential bias built into the system being used (Castel-\nfranchi,1998). Yet other researchers argue that AI-powered agents provide options to \nhelp make online learning and learning cost-efficient while increasing learning gains \n(Goel, 2020). Some recent researchers suggest a future where not only will students \nbe supported by AI agents, but AI agents will serve as potential team teachers to help \naugment areas of content or instructional needs (Lan & Chen, 2024). \nDai and Ke (2022) highlighted the emergence of virtual agents powered by AI, \nbenefiting from advancements in natural language processing and generative AI, as a \nsignificant trend in educational applications. These AI agents are evolving to become \nmore convincing and expressive, capable of responding to student emotions with ad-\nvances in multimodal data collection, recognition algorithms, and signal processing. \nStudies by Baker et al. (2008), Nakano and Ishii (2010), Prepin et al. (2012), and Yu \net al. (2013) have explored automating positive relationship detection by analyzing \nconversational behaviors. However, most of these studies are either at the higher \neducation level or fail to include neurodiverse students in their testing populations \n78   |   JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PREPARATION 4.2\nDIEKER ET AL.  |  79\nand training data (Memarian & Doleck, \n2024). While there is broad research \nsupport for the effectiveness of affective \nvirtual agents supporting student motiva-\ntion and self-efficacy (Dai et al., 2024; \nGuo & Goh, 2015), research supporting \nthe generalization of affect measurement \ntechniques and virtual agent design for \nneurodiverse students is rare.\nIntegrating AI agents into educational \nsettings has garnered significant atten-\ntion recently (Barz et al., 2024), particu-\nlarly in enhancing teaching methodolo-\ngies and student engagement. AI agents \ncan provide virtual representations of \nusers while offering a unique avenue \nfor interaction and learning in digital \nenvironments. The use of AI agents in \nthe classroom has been explored across \nvarious studies (Dai et al., 2024; Jeon, \n2022), highlighting its potential to create \nimmersive and interactive learning \nexperiences. \nThe effectiveness of AI agents in \neducation is further supported by the \nwork of Schroeder and Axelsson (2006), \nwho examined the impact of AI agents \non social presence in virtual learning \nenvironments; a more recent study found \npositive use in heart patients’ self-care \nin the field of nursing (Wonggom et al., \n2020). Charlton and colleagues (2020) \nnoted the impact on social initiation for \nstudents identified with Autism spectrum \ndisorder (ASD). Their findings suggest \nthat AI agents can facilitate a sense of \ncommunity and belonging among stu-\ndents, a crucial aspect of effective learn-\ning. As facilitated by teacher AI agents, \nthis sense of presence can bridge the gap \nbetween traditional and digital learning \nspaces, making education engaging and \naccessible.\nMoreover, AI agents’ adaptability \nprovides a personalized learning experi-\nence catering to students’ diverse needs. \nWith further advances in multimodal \ndata collection, recognition algorithms, \nand signal processing, these AI agents \nare becoming more convincing, expres-\nsive, and responsive to student emotions. \nPrevious research has found ways to \nautomate positive relationship detection \nthrough the collection and analysis of \nconversational behaviors such as verbal \nturn-taking, body posture, facial expres-\nsion, and eye gaze behavior (Baker et \nal., 2008; Nakano & Ishii, 2010; Prepin \net al., 2012; Skantze, 2021; Yu et al., \n2013). Anagnostopoulou et al. (2020) \nexplored the customization of teacher \nAI agents and its impact on student \nmotivation and engagement. The study \nfound that personalized AI agents could \ncater to individual learning preferenc-\nes, enhancing the educational experi-\nence. This personalization aspect of AI \nagents signifies a shift towards more \nstudent-centered learning approach-\nes, where the educational content and \ndelivery methods are tailored to meet the \nunique needs of each learner.\nConsidering the specific area of social \nand communication skills development \nfor students with ASD, initial efforts \nsuggest emerging facial recognition \ntechnology can be used effectively to \nhelp students identify and learn dis-\ncrete facial expressions  (Garcia-Garcia \net al., 2022; Ali et al., 2023) . Further, \nusing a social virtual agent can increase \nstudent initiation of conversation  (Li et \nal., 2023) . Yet, most of these systems \nfocus on direct training of facial emotion \nrecognition without the complexities \nof participating in a responsive social \ndialogue  (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2022; \nHarrold et al., 2014) . Examining the \nrole of AI virtual agents in more natural \nsocial interactions remains an emerging \narea of study. \nAI Agent Implementation  \nby Teachers\nAlthough AI tools hold promise for \nteachers, their implementation is not \nwithout challenges. Technical issues, \nsuch as the requirement for robust digital \ninfrastructure and the risk of reduced \nhuman interaction, create barriers to \nwidespread classroom adoption. Edu-\ncators need to prioritize reliable tech-\nnology and balance virtual and human \ninteractions when integrating AI agents \ninto their teaching practices.\nTeachers’ use of AI agents in the \nclassroom presents a promising avenue \nfor enhancing educational experiences. \nThe literature suggests AI agents can \nsignificantly improve student engage-\nment, foster a sense of community, and \nprovide personalized learning experienc-\nes. However, successfully integrating AI \nagents into educational settings requires \ncareful consideration of technical and \ninterpersonal challenges. \nThe authors provide a summary of \nan ongoing research study being im-\nplemented in four elementary schools \nattempting to create a teacher-driven AI-\nagent model for working with students \nto learn coding while supporting stu-\ndents in self-regulation (specifically on-\ntask behavior), positive interactions, and \ncommunication skills during math class. \nThe research team shares an overview of \nthe study, a vignette, and steps for using \nAI agents in the classroom. The team \nthen shares the struggles and pitfalls of \nusing AI agents as well as considerations \nfor teachers working to integrate person-\nalized AI tools into classroom settings.\n In this article, we describe the application of  \nAI agent support in teacher preparation \nprograms and a vision of the future of using  \nAI agents in instruction.\n\n80   |   JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PREPARATION 4.2\n Study Overview\nProject RAISE represents a collab-\noration led by UCP of Central Florida \nin collaboration with the University of \nCentral Florida and the University of \nKansas. UCP of Central Florida is a \nnonprofit organization and is a network \nof inclusive public charter schools. The \nU.S. Department of Education Office \nof Special Education Program (OSEP) \nfunds the project through a Stepping \nUP Grant. Project RAISE aims to \nimprove the social skills of students \nwith disabilities (SWD) by creating an \nAI-driven socially assistive character, \nZB™ in K-5 classrooms and an online \nrobot, Ray-Z, that teaches basic coding \nskills. At its core, Project RAISE aims to \nimprove communication skills and time \non task for SWD while enhancing these \nstudents’ educational experiences by \nfocusing on coding, science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) \ncontent. \nCentral to this initiative was the devel-\nopment of ZB™, an AI agent type de-\nsigned to support SWD in acquiring so-\ncial skills and fundamental coding skills. \nThe AI agent, ZB™, supports students \nthrough three study phases. These range \nfrom learning basic coding from ZB™ \nto coding with a peer and having ZB™ \nin the classroom to support on-task and \ncommunication skills. Implementation \nof ZB™ initially occurred using mul-\ntiple setups of an iPad, programming a \nphysical robot using Blockly, and a ted-\ndy-bear-like AI agent that was initially \ncontrolled by a human-in-the-loop. The \nstudent also wore a biometric device to \nhelp trigger the changing colors of the \nheart and face of the AI agent to mirror \nthat of the participant. Using iterative \ndevelopment cycles of the AI agent, the \nteam made several changes based on \nteacher feedback. These changes are \naligned with supporting new teachers \nin preparing for this changing world of \nusing AI agents in the classroom.\nAs the project evolved and the AI \nagent became automated, the following \nvignette shows how such an agent is \nused in classrooms: \nA teacher, Mr. Aiden, wants to use an \nAI agent to help students learn coding. \nFirst, he decides to see if his students \nwho might struggle in working with \npeers could learn to code a simple \nsquare with an online robot and an AI \nagent coaching the student. After he \nfinds success with the basic coding, he \ndecides to build further the relationship \nof the student who struggles with the AI \nagent by having the student teach a peer \nhow to create the same simple square \nwith the support of the AI agent. The \nteacher then realizes the power of the re-\nlationship of the AI agent in supporting \nthe students and knows this agent can \nprovide affirming statements to students \nduring instruction. He decides to inves-\ntigate whether this is helpful to students’ \nself-regulation and confidence in class \nparticipation. He finds that if he goes \nthrough the use of the agent over time \nand the relationship is built, the agent \nhas value in the classroom. Initially, he \nused the agent for student affirmation \nbut found the connection was too foreign \nand actually was distracting. However, \nafter students learned with and taught \nFIGURE 1: Implementation Steps for Consideration of using an AI Agent in the Classroom\nWhen implementing an AI agent effectively in the classroom to support student learning and on-task behavior, teachers can \nfollow these guidelines:\nPurpose and Scope:\n• Understand the specific purpose of using an AI agent in the classroom. The AI agent should enhance student engagement, \nprovide personalized assistance, and promote positive behavior.\n• Ensure that the AI agent aligns with the educational goals of the classroom and complements existing teaching methods.\nGuiding Principles for AI Agent use:\n• Use the AI agent to address individual student needs, such as providing additional explanations, answering questions, \nproviding affirming statements, or offering study tips.\n• Leverage the AI agent to encourage positive behavior, reinforce on-task actions, and provide timely feedback.\n• Ensure the AI agent adheres to student privacy regulations and maintains a safe online environment.\n• Communicate the AI agent’s role, capabilities, and limitations to students, fostering trust and understanding.\nEnsure Teacher-Student Collaboration:\n• Introduce the AI agent to students, explaining its purpose and how it will assist them.\n• Encourage students to provide feedback on their interactions with the AI agent. Adjust its behavior based on student input.\n• Monitor student interactions with the AI agent to identify any issues or challenges.\n• Intervene when necessary to ensure a positive experience.\nRemember, the purpose of using an AI agent is to enhance the learning environment, promote student engagement, and \ncontribute to a supportive classroom atmosphere. \nDIEKER ET AL.  |  81\nwith the AI agent, their relationship was \nestablished, and the agent provided a \npositive connection and not a distraction \nin the classroom setting. \nThis example reflects what the team \nhas learned from their project, which \nis reflected in Mr. Aiden’s use of AI \nagents. This form of AI will not work for \nall students, but it can be helpful if the \nstudent sees a positive relationship with \nthe agent, which is a critical step for \nteachers to consider when using agents \nin the classroom. Figure 1 provides steps \nto consider when using an AI agent to \nsupport student learning. \nChanges in Project RAISE  \nand Alignment with  \nTeacher Preparation\nOther lessons were learned that \nteachers should consider. Initially, the \nappearance of the AI agent selected was \nconsidered too juvenile for the upper \nelementary grade levels, so the team \ndecided to create a revision of the AI \nagent. They decided to let the students \nselect from several models of an agent. \nThey then had students in the partner-\nship elementary school site vote on their \nfavorite avatar, with the team paying \nspecific attention to the votes of children \nwith disabilities since this was the proj-\nect’s focus. The objective for this revised \navatar was to create a “more” mature \nAI agent. See Figure 2 for images of the \noriginal and revised avatars. As teacher \neducators prepare new teachers to work \nwith those with disabilities, they should \nconsider the authenticity and age-appro-\npriateness of any AI tool being imple-\nmented. \nThis team also learned several other \nlessons as they ventured into AI agent \nuse with SWD. Initially, existing natural \nlanguage processing was used to create \nthe dialogue, but the team found that \nnatural language models needed to \nreflect the unique dialogue presented by \nthe students. The content and complex-\nity of verbalizations can be analyzed \nusing natural language processing (NLP) \ntechniques. Natural Language Process-\ning emerged from interdisciplinary fields \nand combines computer science, artifi-\ncial intelligence, and linguistics to en-\nable computers to understand, interpret, \nand manipulate human language. The \nuse of NLP can help identify patterns \nof speech, which in this case were used \nto program the AI agent using authentic \ntext from the students with ASD. \nUsing NLP, the team decided to pilot \nthe tool for 2 years with a human-in-\nthe-loop to help create dialogues for the \nAI agent that were simple, precise, and \nfriendly to the nuances of errors, patterns \nof speech, and questions posed by SWD. \nAfter carefully analyzing the way a \nskilled human interacted with children \nwho were neurodiverse, the team then \nused natural language software (Otter.ai) \nto create an appropriate dialogue for the \nAI agent. \nAs teachers are being prepared in spe-\ncial education, new AI agent tools that are \nconsidered for use should be analyzed for \ntheir ability to respond to potential speech \nimpairments and to ensure the dialogue \nused is at a level of comprehension and \nnatural exchange for the range of SWD \nthey serve. Teachers also should be aware \nof the bias that exists in all AI tools, and \nshould specifically find tools that include \nrepresentation of the range of students \nwith disabilities they might be serving in \ntheir future classrooms (e.g., communica-\ntion board, limited speech ability, lack of \nclarity in articulation). \nTwo important lessons were learned to \nguide teacher educators as they prepare \nthe next generation of special education \nteachers using AI. First, when AI models \nare built, be aware they often are built \non the “typical” and hold not just race, \nclass, and potential gender bias but often \nare void of any representation of people \nwith disabilities. Before adopting AI \ntools, educators should consider biases \nthat may be present based on how they \nwere developed. Second, “less is more” \nwhen planning to use AI tools with \nSWD. In the early development stages, \nthe project team used an iPad, Blockly \nthe robot, a taped square, and a bio-\nmetric device, and students were taken \ninto another room with a tech coach to \nconduct this study. Realizing a need to \nconsolidate the tools and time, the team \nFIGURE 2: The original AI Agent \nZB and the Revised ZB from \nStudent Input\nFIGURE 3: The AI agent ZB™ \nand his partner, Ray-Z\n82   |   JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PREPARATION 4.2\ncreated Ray-Z so all tools needed for \nthe project were available in one space \n(See Figure 3 for images of ZB™ and \nRay-Z the AI tools used in the project). \nThis containment in one setting and one \nplatform on the computer gave the team \na focused setting to use facial tracking \nto mirror the student’s emotions in the \nAI agent ZB™. Students could still see \nthe AI agent while coding the robot on \nthe iPad. A biometric device, the Polar \nVerity Sense, was also placed on the \nstudent to help understand stress, but in \nthe future, the goal is to eliminate this \nadded device and move to an iPad or \nlaptop that can pick up these same bio-\nmetric signals using just a camera. The \nteam also learned that providing the AI \nagent within the classroom may be dif-\nficult with logistics for space and time, \ninternet and Bluetooth connections, and \nteacher time; however, it works better \nfor the students and reduces the overall \nclassroom disruption of students leav-\ning and entering the classroom. A final \nchallenge of the project is to make this \neasy for teachers to use, which has been \nthe recent focus.  \nInitially, this project was delivered by \na research team but evolved to teachers \ndirectly overseeing all project phases in \nFall 2023. From the start of the project, \nthe team wanted to help students and \nteachers understand the stress of SWD \nby using biometric devices connected \nto the AI agent to generate a custom-\nized response to the learner. The team \nprogressed in comprehending the nature, \nutilization, and intricacies of biometric \ndata concerning children and its role \nin activating AI agents to help teachers \n(Hughes et al., 2022; Ali et al., 2023).\nResearch Goals\nTo investigate the potential of the AI \nagent in supporting student communi-\ncation and self-regulation goals, the re-\nsearch team focused on increasing inter-\nactions and time on task of participants. \nIn the area of communication, the team \nspecifically studied verbal reciprocity. In \nthe development stage, the team exam-\nined Phase 1 conversations between \nthe participant and the AI agent. Once \nthe project’s pilot stage was underway, \nthe team studied interactions in Phase 2 \nbetween participants and peers working \ntogether to code the robot. In Phase 3 \nthe emphasis shifted to participants’ \ninteractions with their teacher and peers \nduring mathematics instruction with the \nAI agent providing social-emotional \nsupport. During mathematics instruction, \nthe teachers implemented a think-pair-\nshare strategy to ensure student commu-\nnication could continue with their peers \nand prompted by the AI agent. The team \nprovided professional development to \nensure teachers understood the think-\npair-share strategy and the importance \nof implementation fidelity at this stage. \nDuring Phases 1 and 2 of the study, the \nlearning was student-driven, with ample \nopportunities to initiate a conversation \nwith either the AI agent or, in Phase 2, a \npeer and the agent. In Phase 3, the teach-\ner conducted the classroom routine, with \nthe AI agent providing social-emotional \nsupport to the participant.\nTeacher educators can support teacher \ncandidates in learning new AI tools, but \ngrounding them in evidence-based and \nhigh-leverage practices is important to \nensure positive outcomes even when \nintegrating an AI tool. Teacher prepa-\nration programs need to help teachers \ntoday not just think about room arrange-\nments for grouping but also the logistics \nbehind charging devices, integrating \ndevices into instruction, creating centers \nfor learning coding, or using evolving AI \ntools that are student-driven and teach-\ner-independent. One aspect of Project \nRAISE is that the tools used are evi-\ndence-based practices but require limited \nteacher time and interaction. These AI \ntools used in the classroom can set new \nteachers up for success and create a \nmore robust learning environment for \ndifferentiation for students with disabil-\nities. \nFindings to this Point and \nTeacher Application\nAfter a comprehensive analysis of the \ndata from 2023, it became evident that \nquantifying the frequency of student \nopportunities to initiate conversations \nor to respond to others would provide \nmore insightful findings. Further assess-\nment revealed improvements across all \ncommunication aspects, from pre-obser-\nvations to post-observation evaluations. \nInstances of teacher-led peer-to-peer \ninteraction opportunities surged from \n127 across teachers to 220 with the same \nteachers in 2023, while SWD responses \ndemonstrated a slight increase. Notably, \nstudent engagement with peer inquiries \nachieved a 100% response rate, with \npeer-generated questions rising from 14 \nto 23. Student-initiated interactions with \nboth teachers and peers demonstrated \nsignificant growth, escalating from 111 \nto 207 and from 122 to 220, respectively. \nThese results highlight a substantial im-\nprovement in communication dynamics \nacross all assessed categories from the \ninitial to the final assessments ensuring \nteachers used a simple think-pair-share \nstrategy and providing support from an \nAI agent during mathematics instruction. \nA few barriers to consider in working \nwith new and innovative ideas based on \nthis project were identified as persistent \nissues as the project was scaled to mul-\ntiple schools and districts. First, school-\nbased instability still exists with basic \ninternet connectivity. This instability \nimpacted the ability of teachers to access \nthe web-based platform and, at times, \ncaused them to become frustrated with \nthe project system. In this project the \nteam found solutions such as providing \nhotspot devices to ensure dependability \nduring the research sessions, but that \nis not an option usually available to a \nDIEKER ET AL.  |  83\nteacher. A second barrier, especially \nearly in the study, was implementation \nfidelity. Although training was provid-\ned, some teachers required follow-up \ndiscussions to ensure the think-pair-\nshare strategy was being used as intend-\ned. Based on the year 4 teacher survey \nresults, the think-pair-share strategy \nutilized in the study was shown to be \nvaluable to teachers beyond the project. \nThis emphasizes how good teaching \npractices are beneficial to students with \ndisabilities beyond the scope of this \nstudy and are still needed even with \nAI-driven or supported instruction. \nThe support for using these strategies \nby administrators has been positive, with \nadministrators and teachers choosing to \nsign up to use the AI agent. Administra-\ntive and technology support are essential \nfor AI use, but knowing how to show \nthe strengths, limitations, and safeguards \nof tools being adopted is essential to \npreparing teachers for this new frontier \nof potential use or misuse of emerging \ntools. Helping teacher candidates under-\nstand how they can engage students with \ntechnology and provide needed accom-\nmodations or modifications should be \npart of a preparation program in special \neducation. Teacher educators need to \nprepare teacher candidates for the safe \nand ethical use of AI, and a great re-\nsource to consider is the ISTE Standards \n(2000). Also, vetting the tools used and \nknowing how to work with administra-\ntive and technology teams, as well as \nensuring privacy and safeguards for the \ntools used, are critical considerations for \nthe field. \nUse of AI agents in Classroom \nBased on our research, this team \nsupports using AI agents in classrooms \nto provide support in teaching content \nand supporting students’ social-emotion-\nal needs. The team further believes that \nthese tools can help alleviate the stress \nmany teacher candidates feel (Brady et \nal., 2023; Saloviita & Pakarinen, 2021; \nLeko et al., 2024) and perhaps help with \na critical need in the recruitment and \nretention of special education teachers \n(Rock et al., 2023). However, the pro-\ncess for using these tools and under-\nstanding what is “under the hood” of any \nAI agent used needs to be a part of the \ndiscussion in teacher preparation pro-\ngrams. For example, machine learning \nmodels have great promise in education, \nboth for student success and as tools to \naid teachers in better understanding their \nstudents. These algorithms can pro-\nvide teachers with information on their \nstudents’ physical presence, stress levels, \nand focus. Using physical presence, the \nAI agent can encourage more involve-\nment by the student if he or she loses fo-\ncus, which can often be assessed by eye \ngaze (Stiefelhagen et al. 1999, Massé \net al. 2017). For teachers to understand \nthe specific benefits of AI tools such as \nthese, more specific applications must \nbe presented and readily available. The \ncurrent project includes these metrics to \ndrive the dialogue and expressions of an \nAI virtual companion (AIC) dedicated to \nan individual student. \nChallenges in AI Use for \nEmotional Responses\nWhile physical presence and focus \nbased on eye gaze are objective mea-\nsures easily determined by vision-based \nalgorithms, stress can involve many \nmeasures that vary by individual. e.g., \nheart rate, blood pressure, respiration, \nfacial expression, frequency, variability, \nintensity, and timing of speech (Nem-\ncova et al., 2020; Rojo Lopez et al. \n2021). Some of these can be assessed \nwith simple non-invasive solutions \nusing a camera (facial expression), and \na microphone (speech attributes). The \nothers (heart rate, blood pressure, and \nrespiration) have commonly been mea-\nsured using biosensor devices (Shen et \nal. 2021). However, recent advances in \nvision-based approaches have mitigated \nand, for many applications, replaced \nbiosensors with analysis of facial camera \ninput (Perepelkina et al., 2020). In this \nproject, an AI-based method can detect \nemotions using biosensors, vision-based \nphysiological signal, and facial expres-\nsion analysis. \nIn this real-time application, barriers \nto use were identified. One limitation is \nthat participant faces may be occluded \ndue to head and body movements and \nlow illumination. Similarly, background \nnoise can make voice signals noisy in \nclassroom environments. The project \nteam moved to physiological signals \nacquired from biosensors to detect emo-\ntion and stress levels in such scenarios. \nMoreover, using multiple modalities is \nnow a common approach in machine \nlearning to determine emotion, provid-\ning more robust solutions to variable \nclassroom environments (Sharma & \nDhall 2021).\nUnfortunately, the interpretation of \nemotion indicators, whether through \nunimodal or multimodal data, can be \nhighly subjective, as baselines for people \nvary, and generalization of the machine \nlearning algorithms to unseen data is \nchallenging. As a result, biases can arise \nbased on many human attributes, in-\ncluding age (Kim et al. 2021), skin tone \n(Halberstadt et al. 2021), culture (Li & \nDeng 2020), and neurological differenc-\nes (Yitzhak et al. 2020).\nIn this project, the approach was to be \nsupportive and never critical, much like \nwhat is taught to teacher candidates us-\ning positive behavioral support models \n(Sugai & Horner, 2009). The AI agent’s \ninteraction with the participants aligned \nwith the overall philosophy of PBIS, \nwhich was to create a safe and predict-\nable environment for student success. \nThis supportive model used by the AI \nagent involves uttering encouraging \nmessages and maintaining a positive fa-\ncial expression and body pose. In cases \n84   |   JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PREPARATION 4.2\nwhere the algorithm detects a continued \nlack of attention, the AI companion \ngently says a phrase such as “Boy, it can \nbe hard to stay on task, but let’s try.”  In \ncases where stress seems to increase, \nthe team’s approach always treats a \nmachine-determined emotion category \nas a suggestion, not necessarily a fact. \nUsing this point of view, our system \ntriggers the AI agent to behave in a way \nthat would support an individual who \nis stressed but in a manner that is also \nsupportive of any learner.\nAs a simple example of handling ap-\nparent stress, the AI agent might indicate \nthat it needs some help getting its focus \nback and ask the participant to help it do \nbreathing exercises. The system can then \nuse respiration data from the student \nto affect the AI agent’s breathing rate \n(chest expansion and contraction). If the \nstudent is breathing too fast, the AI agent \ncould suggest that it would like to relax. \nThis approach puts the control in the \nhands of the student, is non-disruptive \nto the class, and is a strategy we feel is \npreferable to the AI agent labeling the \nchild’s emotion in a way that may be in-\nterpreted as the AI agent being dominant \nor using potential bias.\nFuture Connections of AI Agents \nto Teacher Education  \nUsing AI agents in the classroom \ncould involve a complex system like \nthe one created by Project RAISE, an \nopen-source, free tool designed for \nuse by teachers. Alternatively, teachers \nmay increasingly have the opportunity \nto create simple AI tools for skill or \nsocial-emotional acquisition using an ev-\ner-increasing array of online tools. New \nvoice-generated AI tools by OpenAI or \nGoogle Gemini and other companies \nwill support the potential for teachers to \nhave AI agents, much like a Pet Rock or \nTABLE 1: Microsoft Co-Pilot’s Response to the Future of AI in Teacher Preparation\n\n DIEKER ET AL.   |   85\na Furbee of the past. Teachers can create \nmore sophisticated AI agents, chatbots \n(e.g., https://mizou.com creates bots \nin 50 languages or https://chaindesk.\nai creates a custom chatbot with no \nprogramming), and robots (e.g., Moxie, \nDash or Loona) to provide behavior-\nal and learning support. For teacher \neducators, this means modeling the use \nof current technology, and, for teachers, \nit requires openness to trying new tools \nwhile keeping in mind data privacy, \nbias, and security issues. For example, \nProject RAISE has made all tools web-\nbased with the option to “just use” the \ntool without recording or using biomet-\nric data. The integration of AI tools is \nthe future and teachers and those who \nprepare them need both acceptance and \naccess to these tools to assist them and \nthe students they teach. \nThe future use of AI agents and \nbiometrics in teacher education is \nunknown, but results of the following \nprompt provided to Microsoft Co-Pilot, \n“What is the future use of AI agents \nwith integrated biometric data in teacher \npreparation?” and provided in Table 1 \noffers a glimpse of what could lie ahead \nin the area of AI. \nIntegrating Project RAISE, focus-\ning on socially assistive AI agents like \nZB™ and Ray-Z, the robot, into teacher \npreparation programs could significantly \nenhance future educators’ competency \nin leveraging technology for inclusive \neducation. Considerations for project \nuse of RAISE and other AI-agent usage \nin teacher preparation programs are \nprovided. \nCurriculum Development. Teach-\ner preparation programs can include \nmodules or courses on designing and \nimplementing technology-based inter-\nventions for students with disabilities. \nProject RAISE can serve as a case study \nor a core component of these modules, \nproviding insights into the development, \napplication, and impact of socially assis-\ntive technology in educational settings.\nHands-on Training. Future teach-\ners can receive hands-on professional \ndevelopment (PD) in using socially \nassistive AI agents and robots within \nthe classroom. This PD could involve \nsimulations and role-playing exercises \nin controlled environments, such as in \nTeachLivE (Dieker et al., 2023) housed \nat the University of Central Florida in \nthe Center for Research in Education \nSimulation and Technology, to practice \nengaging students with diverse learning \nneeds through these technologies.\nEnhancing Understanding of \nExecutive Functioning. Programs can \nuse these tools to discuss how to help \nstudents with executive functioning \nskills and their importance in education-\nal success. Teacher candidates might \nreflect upon how technologies, like those \nin Project RAISE and other off-the-shelf \nAI agent tools, could be used to support \nthese skills. By understanding the princi-\nples behind Project RAISE’s approach to \nenhancing executive functioning, teach-\ner candidates can design interventions \ntailored to their future students’ needs.\nInterdisciplinary Collaboration. \nTeacher preparation programs could \nfoster interdisciplinary collaboration by \ninvolving special education, psychology, \nand computer science experts to pro-\nvide a holistic view of how technology \ncan support students with disabilities. \nThis approach mirrors the collaborative \neffort seen in Project RAISE, offering \nfuture teachers a model for working \nacross disciplines to enhance educational \noutcomes including promoting collabo-\nration with a range of general education \nteachers.\nResearch and Innovation in Educa-\ntional Technology. Teacher educators \nshould encourage teacher candidates to \nengage in research projects that explore \nthe effectiveness of socially assistive \nAI agents in supporting students with \ndisabilities. This research could involve \nassessing the impact of AI agents on \nsocial skills, executive functioning, and \nacademic achievement, contributing to \nthe evidence base for best practices in \nthe use of educational technology.\nInnovation Labs. Teacher educators \nshould consider creating in-person or \nonline innovation labs where future \nteachers can develop their own educa-\ntional technologies, potentially including \nthe tools from Project RAISE. They \nshould also consider reviewing other \nOSEP Stepping Up grants that involve \nmany novel technological tools. These \ninnovation labs could provide a cre-\native space for prototyping new tools \nand methods for inclusive education, \nfostering a culture of innovation among \nteacher candidates in the rapidly emerg-\ning world of AI.\nProfessional Development and Con-\ntinuous Learning. Teacher educators \nshould ensure their programs include \ncomponents that stress the importance of \nongoing PD in educational technology. \nGraduates need to be equipped with the \nskills to continually assess and adopt \nnew technologies, like those developed \nin Project RAISE, to meet the evolving \nneeds of their students. Yet, with a crit-\nical lens and understanding of national \nstandards and guidelines, teachers can \nbe prepared to protect students’ privacy \nand identify potential bias in AI tools \nbeing used. By integrating online and \nfree open education resources, like \nProject RAISE, into teacher prepara-\ntion programs, future educators are not \nonly equipped with knowledge and \nskills to use advanced technology in the \nclassroom but they are also inspired to \ninnovate and contribute to the effective \nuse of AI in the support of student learn-\ning and the field of inclusive education. \nThis approach prepares them to meet the \ndiverse needs of their students, fostering \nan inclusive, engaging, and supportive \nlearning environment for all.\nThe Project RAISE initiative, by \n86   |   JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PREPARATION 4.2\nintegrating the socially assistive AI agent \nZB™ and Ray-Z robot into classroom \nsettings, provides a foundation for \nexploring the use of AI agents to support \nexecutive functioning skills among \nstudents with disabilities. Considering \nthe project’s focus on enhancing social \nskills through interactive and collabo-\nrative learning experiences, extending \nits application to include executive \nfunctioning is a natural progression.\nTo effectively implement this exten-\nsion, the design and programming of AI \nagents must be informed by pedagog-\nical principles and evidence-based strat-\negies targeting executive functioning. \nThis includes creating tasks requiring \nplanning, organization, task initiation, \nand emotional regulation. Additionally, \nincorporating feedback mechanisms \nthat reflect on the student’s perfor-\nmance and decision-making processes \ncan further support the development of \nthese skills.\nIntegrating executive functioning \nskills into Project RAISE involves \nstrategically using the socially assistive \nAI agents, ZB™, and Ray-Z robot. \nThese agents can facilitate activities \nthat specifically target and develop cru-\ncial cognitive abilities (e.g., coding) or \nsupport social-emotional regulation. \nFuture Implications of AI in \nTeacher Preparation and \nEducational Settings \nThere is a great deal of public excite-\nment and concern surrounding the use \nof AI in education based on the abilities \nof ChatGPT, Llama, Gemini, Microsoft \nCo-Pilot, and other Large Language \nModels (LLMs). Given the right tex-\ntual prompts, these tools can produce \ncredible and sometimes jaw-dropping \ntext. Even more impressive are AI \nagents built on these platforms, such as \nDall-E (photorealistic images) and Sora \n(short photorealistic videos). But, all AI \ntools can also provide what is termed \n“hallucinations,” which provide false \ninformation. Think about when you \nask your smart home device what the \nweather is, and it gives information for \nthe wrong city, or you ask for a specific \nquestion, and you get a vague, wrong, \nor no response. With this potential di-\nchotomy of outcomes from AI, caution \nand human review of all information \nproduced is essential. \nMany students are tempted to use \nthese tools to do assigned work without \neven checking the outcomes’ validity \n(often lacking). Others realize these \nare just learning companions that can \nhelp get the creative juices flowing. \nThis view sees AI-enabled systems as \nadvanced versions of existing, accepted \ntools like search engines and Wolfram \nAlpha, each of which can guide your \nthinking or be used just to get answers.\nAt this stage, many teachers consider \nusing AI tools in creative activities like \nwriting and art as cheating, whereas \nothers are embracing the inevitable and \nencouraging the use of these as sources \nof inspiration. Creative teachers are now \nusing AI to inform their classroom activ-\nities, develop assignments, and produce \ninformative visuals, just as some more \nenterprising members of the public use \nthese tools to quickly draft holiday letters.\nThe threat that AI enables false narra-\ntives to be created and spread at blinding \nspeeds and can share false information, \nvideos and images of events that never \nhappened continues to exist. Histori-\ncally, every advancement comes with \ndownsides. The key is universal educa-\ntion and a re-emphasis on open, produc-\ntive dialogue among humans, who are \nnow aided by new digital partners. \nAnother persistent challenge of using \nAI is that generative AI requires large \namounts of data. In this stage of rapid \nadvancement, AI is built based on large \ndata sets that are readily available. How-\never, these datasets may not accurately \nreflect students in specific educational \ncontexts, especially inclusive education-\nal contexts with students who are neu-\nrodiverse. As we build better data sets \nwith attention to representing diverse \nstudents, AI virtual agents are likely to \nimprove and become more responsive \nto individual students, learning how to \ndifferentiate agent behavior to maxi-\nmize student learning. As multimodal \ndata collection and signal interpretation \nimprove, AI virtual agents will likely \nmake decisions based on individualized \ndata with increased confidence. In the \nfuture, AI virtual agents may become as \nvaried and unique as the students with \nwhom they work. Future research should \ncontinue exploring AI agents’ potential \nin education, focusing on innovative \nsolutions to overcome the barriers to \ntheir effective implementation.\nCONCLUSION\nThis current interdisciplinary team \nsees the potential of AI-agent use in \nclassrooms to support both teacher and \nstudent learning. Yet, even with 4 years \nof immersive work in this area, the \nteam cautions the field that the use of \nAI with students has as many ques-\ntions as there are answers. This team \nenthusiastically embraces the potential \nsupport these tools can provide with \nmindful preparation of teachers and the \nadministrators who will support them \nto ensure that this evolution of AI does \nnot further stress an already overtaxed \nand understaffed profession, teachers in \nspecial education. This team believes \nthe power of AI lies in teachers think-\ning differently about instruction by be-\ning prepared differently to think about \nthe potential of these evolving tools to \nfill gaps in areas of deficit and to allow \nstudents to create in areas of strength. \nThe power of AI and any biometric data \nshould lie with the students’ use of this \ninformation to help them as learners, \nwhich is the ultimate goal of teacher \npreparation in any discipline.\nDIEKER ET AL.  |   87\nREFERENCES\nAli, K, Shah, S., & Hughes, C.
