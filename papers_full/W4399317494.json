    "abstract": "Radiology Imaging plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics, providing clinicians with insights into patient health and guiding the next steps in treatment. The true value of a radiological image lies in the accuracy of its accompanying report. To ensure the reliability of these reports, they are often cross-referenced with operative findings. The conventional method of manually comparing radiology and operative reports is labor-intensive and demands specialized knowledge. This study explores the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM) to simplify the radiology evaluation process by automatically extracting pertinent details from these reports, focusing especially on the shoulder's primary anatomical structures. A fine-tuned LLM identifies mentions of the supraspinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon, subscapularis tendon, biceps tendon, and glenoid labrum in lengthy radiology and operative documents. Initial findings emphasize the model's capability to pinpoint relevant data, suggesting a transformative approach to the typical evaluation methods in radiology.",
