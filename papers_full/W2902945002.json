Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon has adopted for integrating genes into host\ngenomes in recent studies. However, SB-derived vector system for proteins purifying/tracking and gene knockout\nare still not available.\nResults: In this study, we generated a series of vectors (termed as pSB vectors) containing Sleeping Beauty IRDR-L/\nR that can be transposed by SB transposase. Gateway cassette was combined to the pSB vectors to facilitate the\ncloning. Vectors with various tags, Flag, Myc, HA, V5 and SFB, were generated for multiple options. Moreover, we\nincorporated the CRISPR-Cas9 cassette into the pSB plasmids for gene knockout. Indeed, using one of these vectors\n(pSB-SFB-GFP), we performed Tandem Affinity Purification and identified that NFATc1 is a novel binding partner of\nFBW7. We also knocked out RCC2 and BRD7 using pSB-CRISPR vector respectively, and revealed the novel roles of\nthese two proteins in mitosis.\nConclusion: Our study demonstrated that the pSB series vectors are convenient and powerful tools for gene\noverexpression and knockout in mammalian cells, providing a new alternative approach for molecular cell biology\nresearch.\nKeywords: Sleeping beauty, FBW7, CRISPR, NFATc1, RCC2, BRD7\nBackground\nEngineered gene expression is a basic technique in mo-\nlecular and cellular biology investigations. Vectors con-\ntaining exogenous genes can be transfected into\nmammalian cells by chemical transfection or electropor-\nation. Unlike in bacteria or yeast cells, plasmids usually\ncan’t be maintained permanently in mammalian cells. It\ntakes long time to get stable expression of exogenous\ngenes in cell lines using virus-free integrating vector,\nsuch as pcDNA3 series of vectors. To achieve stable ex-\npression, retro −/lenti- virus systems are the most popu-\nlar options. However, the utility of retro −/lenti- viral\nvectors is heavily restricted by the size of genes. The\nefficiency of virus package drops dramatically when a\nlarge gene cloned into retro −/lenti- viral vector.\nTransposon system is another option for the delivery of\ngenes. Transposons, also known as transposable elements\n(TE) or jumping genes, comprise DNA transposons and\nretrotransposons. Neither transcription nor package is in-\nvolved in the life cycle of DNA transposons, which makes\ntransposon system simple and ideal tools for delivering\ngenes, especially those larger ones. Sleeping Beauty (SB)\ntransposon, a member of the Tc1/mariner family, is origin-\nally synthesized according to the consensus sequences\nfrom Salmonid fish [ 1]. The SB transposase has been opti-\nmized for higher efficiency in the consequent studies.\nSB100X, the latest version of SB transposase, has a highest\ntransposition efficiency comparing to the earlier versions\n[2]. SB transposon is an important genetic tool in verte-\nbrate system. Due to its high transposition efficiency and\nunbiased integration preference [ 3], SB is widely used for\ngenerating mutations systematically in both mice [ 4– 6]\n* Correspondence: guoyb9@mail.sysu.edu.cn; Yind3@mail.sysu.edu.cn\n†Kaishun Hu, Yu Li and Wenjing Wu contributed equally to this work.\n1Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and\nGene Regulation, Medical Research Center, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital,\nSun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2018, corrected publication January 2019.

SB is also used in gene delivery\nof regular experiments [ 8– 12], as well as in gene therapy\n[13– 16].\nIn the current study, we developed a series of vectors\nwith various gene expression cassettes flanked by SB\ninverted repeats, inverted repeat-direct repeat left/right\nregions (IRDR-L/R), which is recognized by the SB\ntransposase, providing a great convenience tool for mo-\nlecular cell biology experiments: a) CAG promoter was\nemployed for high expression; b) Gateway design was\ncombined with the vectors to make constructions more\nconvenient; c) vectors with various tags, Flag, HA, GFP,\netc., offer more options for different purposes; d) A sys-\ntem expresses N-terminally triple-tagged SFB (S-protein,\nFlag, and streptavidin-binding peptide) peptides for tan-\ndem affinity purification; e) SB delivered CRISPR-Cas9\nsystem was also created to achieve virus-free gene\nknockout.\nResults\nThe construction of the SB delivered vectors: pSB system\nThe vectors for gene overexpression were derived from\na vector described previously [ 7]. In brief, the vector\ncontains CAG promoter, V5 tag, Gateway cassette and\nPuroR-IRES-GFP , and the elements above are flanked by\nSleeping Beauty inverted repeats (IRDR-L/R). We\nsubstituted the V5 tag with different tags (Myc, Flag, HA\nand SFB), resulting in a series of vectors with various\ntags. For each of them, we also made two versions, with\nor without GFP. Overall, ten overexpression vectors\nwere constructed and termed pSB plasmids (Fig. 1a).\nThe vectors for gene knockout (pSB-CRISPR) were de-\nrived from the CRISPRv2 vector (addgene plasmid #\n52961) [ 17]. The U6-sgRNA scaffold-Cas9-PuroR cas-\nsette of CRISPRv2 was amplified and inserted between\nthe IRDR-L/R of pSB plasmid (with the gene expression\ncassette removed). Besides the puromycin resistant ver-\nsion (pSB-CRISPR-Puro), we also created a blasticidin\nresistant version (pSB-CRISPR-Blast), which can be\ntransfected together with the pSB-CRISPR-Puro vector\nand selected with puromycin and blasticidin simultan-\neously (Fig. 1b). When co-transfected with SB100X plas-\nmid (addgene plasmid # 34879) [ 2], the cassette between\nthe SB IRDR-L/R will be cleaved and integrated into\nchromosomes of the host cell, causing exogenous gene\noverexpression or endogenous gene knockout stably\n(Fig. 1c).\npSB vectors were tested and a novel FBW7 associated\nprotein was identified through tandem affinity\npurification using pSB-SFB vector\nTo evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of the Sleeping\nBeauty transposon system (Fig. 1a and 2a), we used\nFBW7 as an example to monitor protein expression in\nlive cells. FBW7 is an F-box protein that recruits sub-\nstrates for the SCF FBW7 E3 ubiquitin ligase. SCF FBW7 de-\ngrades several well-known oncoproteins, including\nCyclin E [ 18], Notch [ 19], c-Jun [ 20] and c-Myc [ 21].\nFBW7 has been demonstrated to play important roles in\nvarious physiological and pathological processes, such as\ntumorigenesis, cell proliferation, stemness and differenti-\nation [ 22]. After FBW7 coding region subcloned into\npSB vectors, GFP signal can be easily detected by fluor-\nescence microscope (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, as shown in\nFig. 2b, the expression of FBW7 increased up to 3 – 5\nfolds compared with the control groups, whereas the tar-\nget gene Cyclin E was declined significantly, demonstrat-\ning that the Sleeping Beauty transposon system has high\nefficiency for intergrating genes into host genome. We\nnext evaluated a system developed for tandem affinity\npurification which expresses N-terminally triple-tagged\n(S-protein, Flag, and streptavidin-binding peptide) pro-\nteins to see if it has good advantages in purifying protein\n(Fig. 2a). HeLa cells was stably transfected and expressed\nSFB-FBW7 (Fig. 2d). After a tandem affinity purification\n(TAP) scheme, proteins associated with FBW7 were\nidentified by silver staining following by mass spectrom-\netry analysis (Fig. 2e and f). Besides the known\nFBW7-binding proteins, such as Cul1, SKP1 [ 22], we\nalso identified NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated\nT-cells, cytoplasmic 1) as a novel binding partner for\nFBW7 (Fig. 2f).\nTo further confirm the high efficiency and fidelity of\npSB-SFB vector in identifying potential interacting protein,\nwe performed immunoprecipitation and in vivo ubiquitina-\ntion assay to validate whether FBW7 is associated with\nNFATc1 and modulates its transcriptional activity. NFATc1\nis a transcription factor that involved in T-cell development,\nosteoclastogenesis, and macrophage function [ 23– 25].\nHowever, recent studies have begun to characterize its roles\nin tumor cells. Activation of NFATc1 induces transcription\nof the c-myc gene and thereby promotes cell proliferation\nand anchorage-independent growth in pancreatic cancer\ncells, indicating that NFATc1 may play a vital role in car-\ncinogenesis [ 26]. Oikawa et al. showed that NFATc1 in-\nduces expression of the transcriptional repressors Snail and\nZeb1, resulting in downregulation of E-cadherin expression\nand changing cell morphology [ 27]. Of note, the phosphor-\nylation of NFATc1 by DYRK1a enhanced NFATc1 protein\nstability by reducing its ubiquitination [ 28]. However, the\ndetailed mechanism of regulat ing NFATc1 transcriptional\nactivity remains unclear. Us ing TAP purification system\ncombined with mass spectrometry, we identified NFATc1\nas a potential substrate of FBW7 (Fig. 2ea n df ) .\nCo-immunoprecipitation detected the interaction between\nFBW7 and NFATc1 at endogenous levels (Fig. 3aa n db ) .\nWe tested whether FBW7 might affect NFATc1 protein sta-\nbility, and found that depletion of FBW7 did not alter the\nHu et al. Mobile DNA            (2018) 9:33 Page 2 of 13\nprotein level of NFATc1, whereas depletion of FBW7 in-\ncreased the protein expressio n of cyclin E, consistant with\nprevious report [18]( F i g .3c). Overexpression of FBW7 also\nhad little effect on the protein stability of NFATc1 in HeLa\ncells (Fig. 3d), indicating that the binding of FBW7 to\nNFATc1 did not promote its degradation. Because FBW7 is\na substrate recognition component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin\nligase, we next examined whether FBW7 promotes NFATc1\nubiquitylation. As shown in Fig. 3e, the polyubiquitinated\nNFATc1 was decreased in FBW7-depleted HeLa cells.\nThese results indicated that FB W7-mediated ubiquitylation\nof NFATc1 may affect on its function, but not on its\nstability.\nIn most cases, FBW7 recognizes and binds its substrates,\nfollowed by targeted ubiquitylation and subsequent degrad-\nation [ 22]. However, recent studies have shown that\nnon-proteolytic ubiquitylation mediated by FBW7 plays a\ncrucial role in the DNA damage response, which is mediated\nby K63-linker ubiquitylation [29, 30].

Phospho-ser10-histone3 (pH 3), an indicator of cells at\nM phase, was used to monitor the G2-M transition in HeLa\ncells. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4b and c, the percentage of\ncells at M phase was remarkably decreased by depletion of\nRCC2, suggesting that RCC2 is important for G2-M progres-\nsion. This is similar to the report of Mythili Y et al, showing\nthat RCC2 is required for progression of G2 cells into mitosis\n[38]. To further examine the role of RCC2 during mitotic\nprogression, we integrated GFP-H2B into HeLa cells to\nmonitor mitotic progression. As shown in Fig. 4da n de ,d e -\npletion of RCC2 significantly delayed mitotic progression\nfrom prometaphase to metaphase, whereas, there was little\neffect on anaphase to telophase progression in RCC2-de-\npleted cells, which is also in consistence with previous report\n[39]. Furthermore, this delayed mitotic progression in\nRCC2-depleted cells were rescued in cells stably expressing\nFlag-tagged RCC2 (Fig. 4f, Additional file 1:F i g u r eS 1 Ba n d\nS1C), ruling out the possibility that our observations were\ndue to sgRNA off-target effects. Collectively, these findings\ndemonstrate that RCC2 is an essential regulator of cell cycle\nprogression during G2-M transition and mitosis, and\npSB-CRISPR vectors are powerful tools in gene function\nstudy.\nExploring novel function of BRD7 in mitosis using pSB-\nCRISPR vector\nThe advantage of Sleeping Beauty transposon system is\nfor large genes delivering and no integration preference,\nwhich avoids the integrations into active genes or their\npromoter regions and has lower off-target effects [ 3, 10].\nIn our previous study, we found that BRD7 forms a com-\nplex with anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/\nC) and is degraded by APC/C cdh1 and APC/C cdc20 during\nthe cell cycle [ 40], indicating that BRD7 may play a pivotal\nrole in mitosis. In this study, we engineered pSB-CRISPR\nvector to investigate the roles of BRD7 in mitosis success-\nfully. First, endogenous BRD7 was effectively depleted\nusing pSB-CRISPR vector with two specific sgRNAs, and\nits downstream genes, ER α and RAD51, were also de-\ncreased (Fig. 5a). The percentage of cells at M phase was\nremarkably decreased in BRD7-depleted cells compared\nwith control group, suggesting that BRD7 is important for\nmitotic entry (Fig. 5b). To investigate the role of BRD7 in\nmitotic exit, BRD7 wildtype and BRD7-depleted cells\nwere synchronized in M phase using nocodazole and\nthen released. The mitotic exit progression in these\ncells was monitored, and mitotic exit was significantly\ndelayed in cells depleted of BRD7 (Additional file 1:\nFigure 2A). Furthermore, time-lapse microscopy of\nHeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged histone 2B\n(GFP-H2B) revealed that depletion of BRD7 caused\nan obvious delay in mitotic exit due to the prolonga-\ntion of prometaphase-metaphase-anaphase-telophase\nprogression (Fig. 5c and d). In addition, BRD7-de-\npleted cells displayed uneven timing of daughter cell\nadhesion to the substratum, suggesting that BRD7 might be\nrequired for proper orientation and positioning of the mi-\ntotic spindle (Fig. 5e, Additional file 1:F i g u r e2 B ) .\nTo clarify further the role of BRD7 in spindle orienta-\ntion and positioning, we analyzed the Z-stage stacks of the\nmitotic spindle by confocal microscopy and measured\nvarious parameters of the mitotic spindle (Fig. 6a and b).\nWe found that depletion of BRD7 expression did not obvi-\nously affect the spindle length (Fig. 6c). Immunofluores-\ncence microscopy of fixed cells showed that BRD7\ndepletion greatly broadened the distribution of the spindle\nangles (Fig. 6d and e). The average spindle angle in\nBRD7-depleted cells was above 20 degrees, indicative of\nspindle misorientation, whereas the average spindle angle\nwas less than 10 degrees in control cells. However, the loss\nof BRD7 did not obviously affect the gross morphology\nand cell diameter (Fig. 6f and g). Therefore, pSB-CRISPR\nvector system is an attractive solution that allows for easy\nand highly efficient gene knockout.\nDiscussion\nIn this report, we have developed a series of vectors\nusing Sleeping Beauty transposon system, providing al-\nternative powerful tools for molecular cell biology study.\nThese vectors can be efficiently and conveniently used\nin: 1) overexpressing target genes with different tags\n(Figs. 1 and 2); 2) purifying protein associators for mass\nspectrometry (Fig. 2); 3) delivering CRISPR-Cas9 system\nto achieve virus-free knockout (Figs. 4 and 5). Using this\nsystem, a novel FBW7-associated protein, NFATc1, was\neasily identified (Fig. 3). Moreover, mitosis-related fac-\ntors: RCC2 and BRD7, were efficiently depleted in HeLa\ncells, further uncovering their roles in mitotic entry and\nexit (Figs. 4, 5 and 6).\nWe developed a series of vectors with great advantages\nby using Sleeping Beauty transposon system. First, pSB\nvectors are very easy to clone with Gateway reaction.\nSecond, the high integration frequency of SB100X trans-\nposase and the strong CAG promoter guarantee high ex-\npression efficiency of target genes. Third, compared to\nvirus vectors, there ’s no limit for target gene and no\nsafety concern of potential infection. Furthermore, we\ncombined CRISPR-Cas9 with transposon system and\nachieved virus-free CRISPR knockout.\nIn this study, we show that NFATc1 is a novel sub-\nstrate of FBW7, which promotes its lys63-linked polyu-\nbiquitylation (Fig. 3). NFATc1, belongs to transcription\nfactors of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)\nHu et al.

A number of approaches have been\ndeveloped to enhance the fidelity of CRISPR-Cas9 medi-\nated genome editing, including shortening guide se-\nquences [ 48], pairing double nicking [ 49], engineering\nCas9 [ 50, 51] and limiting Cas9 exposure with doxycyc-\nline (DOX)-inducible Cas9 (DOX-iCas9) [ 52]. All of\nthese efforts were aimed at decreasing the binding affin-\nity between Cas9/sgRNA and off-target sites. Thus, as\nlong as Cas9 and guide RNA are both present in cells,\nthey will keep potential risk of editing off-target sites. In\nour study, we engineered SB to deliver CRISPR-Cas9\ncassette to achieve constitutively expressed Cas9 which\nmay also result in potential off-target effects and genome\ninstability. In our future studies, we will develop indu-\ncible pSB-CRISPR constructs which exploit SB to deliver\nDOX-inducible spCas9 cassette (addgene #85400) [ 52]\nand sgRNA scaffold (addgene #52963) [ 17] respectively\nto provide a solution for easy genome editing with tight\ntemporal control and minimal off-target effects.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we have successfully established a highly ef-\nficient pSB vector platform, to provide quick and simple\nmethods for gene overexpression, knockout, and protein\npurification, allowing validation large number of genes\nor genes with large size. (NOTE: The pSB vectors will be\nsubmitted to addgene, when this manuscript is\naccepted.)\nMaterials and methods\nCells culture and transfection\nHeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in\nDMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bo-\nvine serum (Life Technologies) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plas-\nmid transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000\n(Life Technologies). siRNA transfection was performed using\nLipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies) ac-\ncording to its protocol. 48 h post-transfection, cells were har-\nvested and subjected to Western blot. The FBW7 siRNA\nsequences as follow:\nGCATATGATTTTATGGTAA, was described previ-\nously [ 53].\nPlasmids construction\nFor the generation of pSB-Flag/Myc/HA-GFP series, we\nemployed mutagenesis kit (Takara, Japan) to introduce\ndifferent expression cassettes. The primers used for\namplification as follows: pSB-Flag-F: GACTACAAG\nGACGACGATGACAAGGAATTG.\nATCACAAGTTTGTA; pSB-Flag-R: CATGGTGGC\nGACCGGTAGCG, pSB-Myc-F: GAACAAAAACTCAT\nCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGAATTGATCACAAGTTTG\nTA; pSB-Myc-R: CATGGTGGCGACCGGTAGCG; pSB-\nHA-F: TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGA.\nTTACGCTGAATTGATCACAAGTTTGTA; pSB-HA-\nR: CATGGTGGCGACCGGTAG.\nCG. For the generation of pSB-Flag/Myc/HA series,\nwhich its GFP tag is deleted, we used the plasmid above\nto amplify GFP-lacked DNA fractions, and the primers\nused for amplification as indicated: pSB-dGFP-F: TGAG\nTTTGGACAAACCACAAC; pSB-dGFP-R: GGTT\nGTGGCCATATTATCAT; For the generation of pSB-\nSFB-GFP vector, the SFB DNA sequences was inserted\nto pSB-V5-GFP vector using the ClonExpress II One\nStep Cloning Kit (Vazyme, China), and all mutations\nwere verified by DNA sequencing. For the construction\nof pSB-Flag-FBW7 or RCC2, the coding region of FBW7\nand RCC2 were firstly subcloned into pDONR221 (Invi-\ntrogen) as entry clones and were subsequently trans-\nferred to Gateway-compatible destination vector\n(pSB-Flag) for the expression of Flag-tagged fusion\nprotein.\nCRISPR-Cas9 knockout\nFor CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of human RCC2 and BRD7 in\nHeLa cells, the following small guide RNAs (sgRNAs)\nwere used: sgRCC2#1: TTGTGTCTGCAGCATGTGGG.\nCGG; sgRCC2#2: TGCAGTAGCAGCAGCGGCGG;\nsgBRD7#1: AGGCAAGTCTAA.\nTCTCACAGGGG; sgBRD7#2: GATCGTTTTTGTCT\nTCGAAGAGG. The gRNA sequences were cloned into\nthe vector pSB-CRISPR. Cells were transfected with in-\ndicated pSB-CRISPR plasmids and transposase SB100X\nfollowed by extensive selection with 2 μg/ml puromycin.\nThe efficiency of knockout was identified by Western\nblot with indicated antibodies.\nThe establishment of stable cell lines and tandem affinity\npurification of SFB-tagged FBW7\nHeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding\nSFB-FBW7 and transposase SB100X. The cell was se-\nlected by culturing in medium containing puromycin\n(1 μg/ml) and confirmed by immunoblot and immuno-\nstaining. For affinity purification, ten plates of HeLa cells\nstably expressing tagged proteins were lysed with NETN\nbuffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM\nEDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 20 min. The\nHu et al.

The beads were\nwashed three times with NETN buffer, and then\nbead-bound proteins were eluted with NETN buffer\ncontaining 1 mg/ml biotin (Sigma). The elutes were in-\ncubated with S-protein beads (Novagen) for 2 h at 4 °C.\nThe beads were washed three times with NETN buffer\nand subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were excised\nand digested, and the peptides were analyzed by mass\nspectrometry.\nWestern blot and immunoprecipitation\nCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0],\n5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a\nprotease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Bimake,\nChina)), and the clarified lysates were resolved by\nSDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for West-\nern blot using ECL detection reagents (Beyotime, China).\nThe immunoblots were processed according to standard\nprocedures using primary antibodies directed to FBW7\n(Bethyl, A301-720A), BRD7 (Bethyl, A302-304A), Cyclin E\n(CST, 20808), GAPDH (CST, 2118), HA (CST, 3724), Flag\n(CST, 14793), Myc (CST, 2278), V5 (CST, 13202), RCC2\n(CST, 5104), RAD51 (CST, 8875), ER α (Santa Cruz,\nSC-514857), tubulin (Santa Cruz, SC-166729), NFATc1\n(Abiocode, R2315– 1). For immunoprecipitation, the super-\nnatants were first incubated with S-protein agarose (Nova-\ngen) overnight at 4 °C, and the precipitates were washed\nthree times with NETN buffer. To detect endogenous inter-\naction, the clarified supernatants were first incubated with\nanti-FBW7 or NFATc1 antibody for two h and then protein\nG-agaroses (Thermo Fisher, 10004D) overnight. After\nwashed three times with NETN buffer, the samples were\ncollected and analyzed by Western blot.\nIn vivo ubiquitination assay\nThis procedure was performed as previously described\n[54]. Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with the indi-\ncated plasmids for 24 h and were treated with 10 μM\nMG132 for 6 h prior to harvesting. The cells were lysed\nin RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitor\ncocktail (Bimake, China). Endogenous NFATc1 was\nimmunoprecipitated using anti-NFATc1 antibody for 12\nh at 4 °C. Polyubiquitinated NFATc1 was detected using\nan anti-HA antibody.\nPhospho-histone H3 staining\nCells were incubated with 100 ng/ml of nocodazole or Taxol\n(2.5μm) for 14 h and were harvested and fixed in 70% etha-\nnol at − 20 °C overnight. Then, cells were resuspended in 1\nml of 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and rotated at 4 °C for 15\nmin. After the cells were centrifuged, the cell pellet was sus-\npended in 100 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum\nalbumin and 2 μg Phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) [Alexa Fluor\n488 conjugate, CST, 3465], and incubated for 2 h at room\ntemperature. Then, the cells were rinsed with PBS containing\n1% bovine serum albumin and stained with propidium iod-\nide, and cellular fluorescence was measured using a FC-500\nflow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).\nFluorescence microscopy\nCells were fixed with colded-methanol for 15 min and\nblocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buff-\nered saline. Cells were then incub a t e di ns u c c e s s i o nw i t hp r i -\nmary and secondary antibodies followed by staining with\nDAPI and examined with a ZEISS confocal microscope\n(ZEISS-800, Germany) equipped with ZENblue2.3 software.\nT h es p i n d l ea n g l ea n ds p i n d l el e n g t hw e r em e a s u r e da sd e -\nscribed previously [55].
