Introduction \nIn the last years, new energy sources have proposed and \ndeveloped due to the dependency and constant increase of \ncosts of fossil fuels. On other hand, fossil fuels have a huge \nnegative impact on the environment. In this context, the new \nenergy sources are essentially renewable energies. It is \nestimated that the electrical energy generation from \nrenewable sources will increase from 19%, in 2010, to 32%, \nin 2030, leading to a consequent reduction of CO2 emission \n[1]. Among these renewable energy sources, solar \nphotovoltaic energy is one of the fastest growing. \n In photovoltaic systems, solar energy is conver ted into \nelectrical energy by photovoltaic (PV) arrays. PV arrays are \nvery popular since they are clean, inexhaustible and require \nlittle maintenance. Photovoltaic systems require interfacing \npower converters between the PV arrays and the grid. These \npower converters are used for two major tasks. First, to \nensure that the PV arrays are operated at the maximum \npower point (MPPT) [2 -7]. Second, to inject a sinusoidal \ncurrent into the grid. Normally there are two power \nconverters [8,9]. The first one is a DC/D C power converter \nthat is used to operate the PV arrays at the maximum power \npoint. The other one is a DC/AC power converter to \ninterconnect the photovoltaic system to the grid. The \nclassical single or three -phase two level voltage source \ninverter is norma lly used for this power converter type [10 -\n12]. However, other topologies have been proposed. \nMultilevel converter topologies are a very interesting choice \nfor realizing this objective.  \nMultilevel power converters present several advantages \nover a convent ional two level converter such as: reducing \nswitching frequency, output voltage with very low distortion \nand reduced dv/dt stress [13 -16]. In this way, several \nmultilevel topologies have been applied to photovoltaic \nsystems [18-23]. \nThere are several PV sy stem configurations. These \nconfigurations are the centralized technology, string \ntechnology, multi -string technology and AC -module \ntechnology. The number and type of power converters that is \nused to interconnect the PV system to the grid is dependent \nof th e technology that is used. The multi -string technology \nhas several different groups of PV arrays. Each group is \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL of RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH  \nVitor Fernão Pires  et al., Vol.2, No.1, 2012 \n85 \n \nconnected in series with a DC/DC converter. This allows \nusing this technology with some multilevel topologies, such \nas, the cascaded multicell i nverters. This topology is based \non the series connection of single -phase inverters with \nseparated DC sources. In this way, each group of PV arrays \nwill be used as a single DC source. This allows avoiding \nhigh voltage amplification. In order to obtain a ga lvanic \nconnection between the grid and the PV generator many PV \nsystems use a power transformer, avoiding that a leakage \ncurrent may flow through the capacitance between PV \ngenerator and ground. Some systems use a transformer \nembedded in a high -frequency DC/DC converter. Others use \na line frequency transformer at the output of the inverter.   \nRelated to these developments, this paper presents a new \npower converter structure for PV systems. The proposed \nstructure uses two single -phase voltage source inverter s, a \nfour wire voltage source inverter and a LeBlanc transformer. \nThis structure is specially developed to use with the multi -\nstring technology. A control system for the multilevel power \nconverter is also proposed. This control system is based on a \nsliding mode controller with a vectorial modulator. Several \nexperimental results are presented in order to confirm the \ncharacteristics of the proposed system.  \n2. Proposed Power Converter Struture \nThe base configuration of the proposed grid connected \nphotovoltaic system is presented in Fig. 1. This system \nconsists of several PV modules, DC/CD power converters, a \nmultilevel DC/AC power converter and a power transformer. \nFor the PV modules arrangement s a multi -string technology \nis used. Each string of the PV array is connected to a DC/DC \nconverter with a MPPT algorithm. The output of these \nconverters is the DC power supply of the multilevel DC/AC \npower converter. The proposed multilevel inverter uses a  \nfour-wire voltage source inverter and two single -phase \nvoltage source inverters.  \n \nFig. 1.  Configuration of the proposed grid connected \nphotovoltaic system. \nFig. 2 presents the configuration of this power converter. \nIn order to obtain different DC voltages, at the output of the \nDC/DC power converters, the PV strings are not equally \ndistributed. To fulfil this purpose, the four -wire voltage \nsource inverter must  have an input DC voltage which is the \ndouble of the input DC voltage of both single -phase voltage \nsource inverters. Considering a VDC input voltage for the \ntwo single -phase voltage source inverters, the four -wire \nvoltage source inverter must have an input  DC voltage of \n2VDC. In this way, the multilevel inverter is able to generate \na seven level shaped output voltage wave. Using equal DC \nvoltages for all inverters only a five level shaped output \nvoltage wave could be obtained. With this different DC \nvoltage arrangement one can obtain the following multilevel \ninverter output voltage combinations: -3VDC, -2VDC, -VDC, 0; \n+VDC, +2V DC, +3V DC. The output of the AC/DC power \nconverter is connected to a Le -Blanc transformer, and the \nsecondary windings of this transfo rmer are connected to the \ngrid. \n \nFig. 2. Multilevel DC/AC converter. \nThe proposed multilevel inverter generates two output \nvoltages that must be shifted by 90 degrees. The Le -Blanc \ntransformer is used to obtain a three -phase balanced voltage \nsystem at the  output of the power converter system. The Le -\nBlanc connection transformer is an asymmetrical winding \ntransformer, which is usually used to transform a three -phase \nvoltage system into a two -phase supply, by means of a \nspecial winding connection [24,25]. Th e winding connection \nof Le -Blanc transformer is shown in Fig. 3. There are five \nwindings on the primary side, separated into two distinct \nphases, and three windings of the secondary side, which are \ndelta connected. \nTo ensure a three -phase balanced system o n the grid \nside, the turn ratio of the windings (Fig.3) must be given by \n(1). \n2\n3\n1\n;2\n3\n1\n;2\n3\n2\n;2\n3\n1\n;2\n3\n1\n11111\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\n          (1) \n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL of RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH  \nVitor Fernão Pires  et al., Vol.2, No.1, 2012 \n86 \n \n \nFig. 3.

Control System \nIn order to maximize the photovoltaic system, \ncontinuously tracking the maximum power po int is ensured \nby the DC/DC converters and correspondent control system. \nThis is also ensured by the use of the perturb and observe \n(P&O) technique [26]. \nSynchronous with grid is achieved by using a phase \nlocked loop (PLL). It is used the Modified synchronous \nreference frame method [27]. The transformation angle is \nobtained with the voltages of the AC network. The speed of \nthe reference frame varies instantaneously depending of the \nwaveform of the three -phase voltage system. Let q be the \ntransformation angle (variable in time). This angle is \ncomputed using the AC voltages using (6) and (7). In this \nmethod, no synchronizing circuit is needed. \n22\ncos\n\n\nee\ne\n\n\n             (6) \n \n22\nsin\n\n\n\nee\ne\n\n              (7) \nSwitching power converters are nonlinear and time \nvariant systems. Sliding mode approach offers a very good \nway to implement a control strategy which exploits the \ninherent variable structure of this type of power converters \n[28, 29]. Due to these inherent characteristics, this type of \ncontrol [30, 31] was chosen to control the proposed \nmultilevel inverter. \nUsing the controllable canonical form of the system \nmodel the sliding mode controller can be obtained. On other \nhand, this controller should impose in each switching period \nT, that the  output voltages V ab and Vcd average values must \nbe equal to their reference average values (8). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n011\n011\n00\n00\nVcd\nT\ncd\nT\nrefcd\nVab\nT\nab\nT\nrefab\nedtVTdtVT\nedtVTdtVT\n         \n (8) \nFrom (6) it is possible to obtain the sliding surfaces \ngiven by (9), where kab and kcd are the gains used to impose \nthe switching frequency: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0)(),(\n0)(),(\n0\n0\nT\ncdrefcd\ncd\ncd\nT\nabrefab\nab\nab\ndtVVT\nkteS\ndtVVT\nkteS\n         \n (9) \nDue to the characteristics of the switching power \nconverters it is not possible to always ensure that the system \ntrajectory always moves on the considered sliding surfaces \n(9).

Simulation Results \nThe proposed power converter structure and control \nsystem have been implemented in Matlab/Simulink and its \nSim Power System Toolbox. The multilevel operation of the \npower converter can be seen in Figs. 5 -7. Fig. 5 presents the \noutput voltage of the four -wire inverter that connects to \nterminal b and the single -phase inverter that connects to \nterminal a.

Conclusion \nA new power conversion structure for a grid -connected \nphotovoltaic system has been presented.  This conversion \nstructure was developed for a multi -string technology \nconfigured PV system. At the output of each PV array string \n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL of RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH  \nVitor Fernão Pires  et al., Vol.2, No.1, 2012 \n90 \n \nis connected a DC/DC power converter with a MPPT \nalgorithm. To obtain an AC signal a DC/AC multilevel with \ntwo single -phase v oltage source inverters and a four wire \nvoltage source inverter is used. Considering distinct input \nDC voltages for the two single -phase inverters and for the \nfour wire inverter, allows to extend the number of achievable \nvoltage levels at the multilevel in verter output. To achieve \nthis characteristic, the DC/DC power converter connected to \nthe single -phase voltage source inverter must generate a V \nvoltage, while the DC/DC power converter connected to the \nfour wire inverter must generate a 2V voltage. In thi s way, a \nseven level shaped output voltage signal is obtained. The \nmultilevel inverter generates two 90º shifted output voltages. \nTo obtain a grid connected three phase balanced system Le -\nBlanc transformer was used. \nTo control the proposed multilevel power  converter a \nsliding mode controller was used. At the output of this \ncontroller it was used a vectorial modulator. To verify the \neffectiveness of the proposed system, several experimental \nresults have been presented. From the obtained results it is \npossible to confirm the proposed multilevel power converter \noutputs a seven level voltage, and that the Le -Blanc \ntransformer allows a three -phase balanced system from a \ntwo-phase system. \nReferences \n[1] European Commission, EU Energy Trends to 2030, \nLuxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union, \naccessedon:http://ec.europa.eu/energy/observatory/trends\n_2030/, 2010. \n[2] E.
