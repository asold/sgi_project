    "abstract": "To study the properties of vegetable oil transformer, the mineral and vegetable insulation oil two transformers with the same parameters are studied using the frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) method. The complex capacitance and the dielectric loss factor are tested by the insulation diagnostic equipment IDAX300, these parameters can reflect the insulation properties of the transformer. The experimental results show that properties of vegetable oil transformer are different to the mineral. The complex capacitance and the dielectric loss factor tanδ of vegetable oil transformer are higher than those of mineral oil transformer, and the moisture content in vegetable oil is higher than that in mineral oil. The test results are also emphatically analysed, which ultimately laid a theoretical foundation for large‐scale operation of vegetable oil transformers.",
