INTRODUCTION\nEarly discovery of faults in power transformers is a challeng-\ning task that can increase the lifetime of such important power\nsystem components while ensuring continuous operation. For\nthis purpose, utilities follow strategies to avoids transformer\noutages due to undesired irregular operational situations,\nthereby increasing their revenue [1]. Typically, the expected\nfaults in insulating structures of power transformers can result\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Shen Yin.\nfrom diverse issues, most importantly mechanical, electri-\ncal, and thermal stresses [1], [2]. Such stresses can have\nnegative impacts on the oil quality of power transformers,\nthus worsening their security and operation. Accordingly,\nthe resulting combustible gases can involve hydrogen (H 2),\nmethane (CH 4), ethane (C 2H6), ethylene (C 2H4), acetylene\n(C2H2), and carbon monoxide (CO) [3].\nTo diagnose and evaluate the diverse transformer fault\ntypes, the ratios of concentrated dissolved gases are employed\nas a common method in the dissolved gas analysis (DGA).\nThe most various interpretation approaches for DGA that\nVOLUME 9, 2021 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\ndependent on the gas concentration ratios are as follows:\nRoger’s three and four ratios, IEC 60599 standard code,\nand Dorneneburg [1]. Further, different methods have been\napplied based on graphical approaches; such as Duval Tri-\nangle and Pentagon techniques [4], [5]. Depending on the\nprevious approaches and graphical DGA techniques, they\nare easy to be implemented, but still have poor diagnostic\naccuracies for the transformer fault types [6], [7].\nTo guarantee high accuracy and efﬁcient diagnostics of\nspeciﬁed transformer fault types, various artiﬁcial intelli-\ngent techniques were implemented. The artiﬁcial neural net-\nwork (ANN) is considered the most widely used method in\nthe literature that has much training data adapting the network\nfor DGA diagnosis [8]–[11]. The input data for ANN can\nbe arranged and optimized for the dissolved gas percent-\nages [8], gas concentration ratios [9]–[11], or others [11],\n[12]. Furthermore, the fuzzy logic system has been applied\nas a second example of artiﬁcial intelligent techniques in\nwhich multi If-Then rules have been executed to relate DGA\nwith the actual fault diagnosis [13], [14]. The third one is\na fuzzy logic system integrated with heuristic optimization\napproaches, such as the hybrid grey wolf optimizer (HGWO)\nadjusting DGA based on a diagnostic approach that is robust\nagainst measurement uncertainties [3]. Additionally, the par-\nticle swarm optimization with enhanced fuzzy logic system\n(PSO-FS) solver has been used to maximize the accuracy\nof IEC 60599 code methods as well as Rogers’ four-ratio.\nMoreover, a support vector machine (SVM) has been intro-\nduced as a new machine learning technique used with a\nslight increase in the diagnostic efﬁcacy [15]–[17]. Recently,\nHGWO combining the differential evaluation approach with\nthe GWO and the supporting of the least-square SVM as a\nhybrid optimizer, which uses the powerful search ability to\nrapid the convergence speed and enhances the performance\naccuracy of the algorithm, resulting in better detection of\ntransformer fault types [18]. Finally, other artiﬁcial intelligent\napproaches have been presented to improve the accuracy\nrate of transformer faults diagnostics like adaptive neural-\nfuzzy-inference framework [19], gene expression program-\nming method [20], and Bayesian neural networks [21].\nAs demonstrated above, several studies are accomplished\nto develop efﬁcient techniques to properly diagnose the var-\nious fault types of power transformers, most importantly\nthe Duval Triangle method, IEC standard, and Rogers’\nratios method, besides several artiﬁcial intelligence-based\napproaches. A novel approach to enhance the diagnostic\naccuracy of the transformer faults is proposed in this work\nby introducing new values for gas concentration percentages\nand ratios. Such introduced values can help to separate the\nconﬂict between the diverse transformer faults, thereby maxi-\nmizing the accuracy rates. To accomplish this ambitious goal,\nan optimization-based model that simultaneously optimizes\nboth gas concentration percentages and ratios, considering\ntheir operational limits, is proposed. The objective func-\ntion is set to be a maximization for the agreement of the\nactual faults relating to the diagnostic faults by the proposed\napproach. In order to accurately solve the proposed opti-\nmization model, an efﬁcient teaching-learning based opti-\nmization (TLBO) is developed, which can obtain the global\noptimal solution. Various practical datasets from the Egyptian\nchemical laboratory and literature (386 DGA data samples)\nare employed to construct the best-suited gas concentration\npercentages and ratios. The proposed TLBO based approach\ncan enhance the accuracy rate of the diagnostic at a sig-\nniﬁcant rate. The robustness of the proposed approach is\nalso demonstrated against uncertainty in measurement where\nthe accuracy of the proposed approach is not affected by\nthe uncertainty rates. Further, the accuracy of the proposed\napproach is compared with ﬁve approaches from the literature\nby means of a practical out-of-sample dataset (a number\nof 89 samples). The proposed DGA algorithm has a higher\nagreement rate than the previous approaches for most fault\ntypes.\nMost of the traditional DGA techniques have poor diag-\nnostic accuracy and, in some cases, they fail to interpret the\ntransformer faults. The researchers do their best to present\na combination between the DGA techniques and artiﬁcial\nintelligence methods to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of\nthe traditional DGA techniques or used the artiﬁcial intelli-\ngent methods individually with the gases concentrations to\nbuild new DGA techniques [22]–[24]. Recently several types\nof researchers attempt to enhance the artiﬁcial intelligent\nmethods’ performance by modifying the method parame-\nters [25]–[28]. In the current work, one of the optimization\ntechniques is TLBO which is the ﬁrst time to apply it to solve\nthe DGA analysis problem to enhance the diagnostic accuracy\nof transformer faults. The diagnostic accuracy of the novel\nTLBO based approach as illustrated in the obtained results is\nhigher the most DGA techniques in the literature.\nII. TLBO ALGORITHM AND IMPLEMENTATION\nTO DGA PROBLEM\nIn this work, we have employed a metaheuristic optimization\nmethod, called TLBO, that is widely used for accurately solv-\ning the nonlinear optimization models. Below, we describe\nthe TLBO algorithm as well as its implementation to the DGA\nproblem.\nA. DGA OPTIMIZATION MODEL\nHere, the DGA optimization problem is formulated as a\nconstrained mathematical optimization model. The ﬁtness\nfunction and the constraints are formulated as follows:\nMax f (x) =NTr\nNTot\n(1)\ns.t. rmin\ni ≤ri ≤rmax\ni , i =1, 2, . . . ,7 (2)\nwhere the ﬁtness function is calculated using the ratio of\nthe number of true estimated transformer fault types by\nthe proposed TLBO based approaches (N Tr) and the overall\nnumber of samples (N Tot). The gases’ ratios are indicated\nin Equation (2) with their corresponding minimum rmin\ni and\nmaximum rmax\ni limits, which is presented in [6], can be\n30818 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. S. M.

TLBO ALGORITHM\nThe TLBO solver has been inspired by a teaching system\nin nature. Speciﬁcally, it involves two items: a teacher as\nwell as several learners [29]. Typically, the teacher of TLBO\ncan share its information with the corresponding learners for\nimproving the quality pattern of all learners. The teacher\nand the learner stages, respectively, are created to improve\nthe performance of all learners. For the teacher stage, every\nlearner beneﬁts from the corresponding best individual, i.e.\nthe teacher, during the iterations to improve its values. If we\nassume that the teaching outcome of a typical teacher can be\nalso alerted by the mean capability of a given class. Under this\ncondition, each learner xi will update its position throughout\nthe teacher stage by the following formula:\nxnew,i =xi +ri(xteacher −xF xmean) (4)\nin which ri represents a random number from zero to one. TF\nrepresents a teaching index to choose the mean value to be\naltered, which can be either one or two. Note that xnew,i can\nreplace xi if the value of xnew,i is better than the value of xi.\nAnother note is that every learner tries to expand its expe-\nrience with the help of communication with the available\nlearners during the learning stage. In turn, a typical learner\nxi arbitrarily picks a peer learner xj ﬁrstly. Later, this learner\ndecides on the route to transfer based on (5) and (6). Also,\nxnew,i can swap xi in the case that the xnew,i value is better\nthan the xi value.\nxnew,i =xi +ri\n(\nxi −xj\n)\nif f (xi) < f (xj) (5)\nxnew,i =xi +ri\n(\nxj −xi\n)\nif f\n(\nxj\n)\n≤f (xi) (6)\nNote that the proposed TLBO considers only the diagnostic of\nthe transformer fault based on the concentrations of dissolved\ngases in the insulating oil of transformers, and so the degree\nof deformation has not been taken into account in our study.\nC. TLBO IMPLEMENTATION\nThe following step-wise procedure can be implemented for\napplying TLBO [29] to the DGA problem:\nStep 1: Construct the DGA optimization model and ini-\ntialize its parameters that are deﬁned in this step.\nSpeciﬁcally, it is required to initialize the following:\n1) population size (P n), 2) number of generations\n(Gn), 3) boundaries of design variables (U L , LL ),\nand 4) the number of design variables (D n). Then,\nthe optimization problem can be deﬁned as: Mini-\nmize f (X), Subject to Xi ∈xi =1, 2, . . . ,Dn. Note\nthat f (X) formulated in (1) represents the objective\nfunction and X represents a vector for design vari-\nables where LL,i ≤x,i ≤UL,i.\nStep 2: In this step, the population is initialized according\nto the size of the population and the number of\nvariables. This population is expressed as:\nPopulation =\n\n\n\nx1,1 x1,2 . . . x1,D\nx2,1 x2,2 . . . x2,D\n..\n. .\n.\n. ... .\n.\n.\nxPn,1 xPn,2 . . . xPn,D\n\n\n (7)\nStep 3: This step represents the teacher phase in which, ﬁrst,\nit is required to compute the mean of the population\ncolumn-wise, which will deliver the mean for the\nparticular subject (M D) as follows:\nMD =[m1, m2, . . . ,mD] (8)\nNote that the best-given solution will consider as\na teacher during the corresponding iteration repre-\nsented by:\nxteacher =xf (x)=min (9)\nLater, the teacher will tend to shift the mean value\nfrom MD towards xteacher. This will represent a new\nmean during the corresponding iteration:\nMnew,D =xteacher,D (10)\nThe variance between the two calculated mean val-\nues (DifD) can be formulated as follow:\nDif D =r(Mnew,D −TF MD) (11)\nThe value of the parameter TF is designated as\n1 or 2. The attained difference can be added to the\nexisting solution for updating its calculated values\nby:\nxnew,D =xold,D +Dif D (12)\nAdmit xnew when it yields improved function value.\nStep 4: Learners can increase their knowledge through\nthe assistance of their shared interaction. The\nmathematical expression is clariﬁed in the above\nsubsection.\nStep 5: Terminate if the maximum number of generations is\nattained; otherwise, go to Step 3.\nAs noticed, the above steps have not addressed the con-\nstraints of the DGA problem. In this article, we utilize the\nDeb’s heuristic technique [30] to handle the constraints with\nthe TLBO technique. In this technique, a tournament selec-\ntion operator is utilized where two candidate solutions are\nnominated and a comparison is established between them. For\nthe optimal selection, the next three rules can be applied:\n• In the case that a particular solution is feasible while\nthe other one is infeasible, thence the feasible one is\nadopted.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 30819\nS. S. M. Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\nTABLE 1. Distribution of the training samples according to the fault types and the references.\n• In the case that the two solutions are feasible, thence the\nsolution with the best objective function value is adopted\nrather than the other solution.\n• In the case that the two solutions are classiﬁed as infea-\nsible ones, thence the preferred solution is the one that\nhas the smallest violation of the constraints.\nThese three rules are incorporated in the TLBO to handle\nthe constraints. Speciﬁcally, they are involved in Step 3 and\nStep 4 which represent, respectively, the teacher and the\nlearner phases. In place of adopting the solution xnew, when\nit gives better objective value in Step 3 and Step 4, Deb’s\nheuristic technique described in [30] can be utilized to update\nxnew by the three abovementioned rules.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe optimization method (i.e. TLBO) is used to enhance the\ndiagnostic accuracy of the traditional DGA methods such\nas IEC code, Rogers ratio method, Duval triangle method,\nand the other recent DGA methods in the literature. The\noptimization method is used to identify the transformer faults\nby adjusting the dissolved gases concentration limits accord-\ning to six transformer fault types. Speciﬁcally, they are cat-\negorized into partial discharge (PD), low energy discharge\n(D1), high energy discharge (D2), low thermal fault (T1),\nmedium thermal fault (T2), and high thermal fault (T3).\nA number of 386 data samples are utilized with TLBO to\nconstruct the diagnostic model that achieving the highest\ndiagnostic accuracy by reducing the diagnostic error between\nthe estimated diagnostic fault and the actual fault. These data\nsamples are collected from the central chemical laboratory of\nthe Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, the Ministry of\nelectricity and renewable energy in Egypt, and the literature.\nTable 1 illustrates the distribution of the data samples based\non the fault types and their sources. The 386 data samples are\ncategorized as 43 data samples for PD, 69 for D1, 115 for\nD2, 81 for T1, 24 for T2, and 54 for T3. The number of\nthe data samples according to each reference is identiﬁed\nas in Table 1, i.e. samples are collected from the laboratory\nand literature. Speciﬁcally, there are 240 samples from [31],\nwhich were considered as ﬁeld data. The distribution of the\nsamples according to each fault according to Table 1, besides\nthere are 99 samples from practical work that is published in\ndetail in [5].\nThe experimental data collected through the online gas\nchromatography device to get the dissolved gas concentration\nin the oil by the chemists in the chemical laboratory. The\ndistribution of the gas concentration percentages according\nto each fault type is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is seen that the\npercentage concentration of H 2 is very high and then it can be\nused as a key or indicator gas for PD fault (see Fig. 1a). For\nD1 fault, as shown in Fig. 1b, the C 2H2 has a high percentage\nconcentration with H 2, then the two gases are indicators for\nD1 fault, but the percentage concentration of H 2 decreases for\nD2 fault and the percentage concentration of C 2H2 increases\nthan in the case of D1, as illustrating in Fig. 1c. The C 2H6\nand CH 4 percentage concentrations are used as indicators\nfor the T1 fault type (Fig. 1d). As in Fig. 1e, three gases\nare the indicators of T2 (CH 4, C 2H6, and C 2H4); therefore,\nthe interfaces with T1 and T3 are obvious and may develop\nincorrect diagnostic of the transformer fault. The C 2H4 is a\nkey gas for T3, Fig. 1f, where C 2H4 concentration is very\nhigh compared with the other gases’ concentrations. Note\nthat Fig. 1 illustrates the distribution of the gas concentration\npercentage of each sample. For example, Fig. 1a explains the\ngas concentration percentage for PD fault (Green symbol)\nwhere the concentration percentage of H 2 is higher than the\nother gases and some of the samples has also high values of\nC2H6 concentration (black symbol). The percentage of each\ngas is its concentration divided by the same of the ﬁve gases\n(H2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, and C 2H2). Fig. 1 was modiﬁed to\nexplain the gas concentration percentage at each transformer\nfault type.\nApplying the TLBO on 386 samples developed the per-\ncentage concentration limits for each gas based on the fault\ntype to extract the appropriate percentage gases’ concentra-\ntions and gases’ ratios that achieve the highest diagnostic\naccuracy of transformer faults. To obtain the highest diag-\nnostic accuracy, two scenarios are proposed, the ﬁrst one\n(scenario 1) is only handling with the percentage gases’ con-\ncentration limits, and the other scenario (scenario 2) is based\non developing new gases’ ratios in addition to the percentage\ngases’ concentrations to separate between the interfaces faults\nto enhance the diagnostic accuracy of the ﬁrst scenario.\nA. DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF TLBO SCENARIO 1\nIdentifying the fault type and computing the diagnostic\naccuracy of transformer faults can be accomplished via the\nﬂowchart in Fig. 2. This ﬂowchart illustrates that the input\ndata are the gases’ percentages according to the summation\nof the main ﬁve gases (H 2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, and C 2H2),\n30820 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. S. M.

For\nexample, if the percentage concentrations of the ﬁve main\ngases belong to PD percentage gases’ concentration limits\nas in stage 1, these percentage concentrations of the gases\nare checked for the other faults (D1, D2, T1, T2, and T3),\nif the concentration is agreed with one of these faults, then\nthe interface between two or more faults is considered, if not\nthen the percentages’ concentration of these gases refer to the\nPD fault type. If the estimated fault type is agreed with the\nactual fault, the diagnose is correct and takes number 1 and if\nnot, the diagnose is incorrect and takes zero. When the com-\nputed percentage concentration of gases is out of the gases’\nconcentration limits, then the model fails to identify the fault\nVOLUME 9, 2021 30821\nS. S. M. Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\nFIGURE 2.

The diagnostic accuracy\nof the proposed method depends on the number of the correct\ndiagnostic samples according to the total number of applied\ndata samples.\nThe role of the TLBO is to adjust the limits of the gases’\nconcentration to reduce the errors between the actual and\nestimated transformer fault types. The procedures of the\nﬂowchart are: 1) the summation of the ﬁve gases is carried out\nvia the historical datasets of the collected data, 2) the gases\npercentages referred to the summation are developed, 3) the\nTLBO initiates the gases’ percentages limits, 4) diagnose the\ntransformer fault type based on the initially suggested limits,\n5) the errors between the diagnosed faults and actual faults are\ncomputed and if the diagnostic accuracy is not reasonable,\n6) the TLBO modiﬁes the gases’ concentration limits with\nnew limits, and 7) repeats the diagnostic process to reduce\nthe lowest errors between the actual and diagnosed faults.\nWhen the errors between the diagnosed and actual faults\nafter some cycles are ﬁxed then the program terminates with\nthe best gases’ concentrations limits and then the model is\nconﬁrmed.\nFigure 3 illustrates the percentage of gases’ concentration\nlimits developed by the TLBO algorithm at different iter-\nations that shows the computed variables for scenarios 1.\nSpeciﬁcally, the computed gas concentration percentages\nrepresented by 35 lines are shown in Fig. 3. The computed\nvariables have initially ﬂuctuated, and then after many iter-\nations, all lines in scenario 1 is being ﬁxed, implying the\nsuccessful convergence of the proposed TLBO algorithm to\ndiagnose transformer fault types.\nTable 2 shows the limits of the gas concentration of\nscenario 1, which satisﬁes the best diagnostic accuracy by\nreducing the diagnostic error for each sample to increase\nthe number of correct diagnostic samples. The diagnostic\naccuracy in scenario 1 is based on the gas limit concentra-\ntion that gives the correct diagnostic transformer fault type.\nTo apply the limits of the percentage concentration of the\ngases in Table 2, the next example can be considered which\nexplains the ﬂowchart in Fig. 2. If the concentration of gases\n30822 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. S. M. Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\nFIGURE 3.

Confusion matrix for TLBO Scenario 1 (Gas percentage limit only).\nin ppm of one sample is 32930 for H 2, 2397 for CH 4, 157 for\nC2H6, 1 for C 2H4, and 0.001 ppm for C 2H2, then the sum\nof these gases is 35486 ppm, therefore, the percentage con-\ncentration of each gas is 92.799, 6.754, 0.4424, 0.00282,\nand 0 for H 2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, and C 2H2, respectively.\nHence, these percentage concentrations of the gases are inves-\ntigated with each fault limits as in Table 2, which satisfy\nonly the percentage gas limits of PD fault after checking\nthe same percentage concentrations with the other faults,\nthen the estimated fault is PD and compares this result with\nthe actual fault if the estimated fault is agreed with the\nactual fault, the diagnostic is 1 and if not, the diagnostic is\nzero.\nTable 3 illustrates the confusion matrix of TLBO\nscenario 1, which was constructed based on the optimal gas\npercentage limits to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of trans-\nformer faults.

The confusion matrix also described the overall accuracy\nof the TLBO scenario 1 where the correct diagnose samples\nare 333 out of 386 samples with an accuracy of 86.27%.\nThe TBLO scenario 1 diagnostic accuracy is evaluated\nbased on the 386 samples that are shown in Table 1. Table 4\nillustrates the diagnostic accuracy of scenario 1 and compares\nits diagnostic accuracy with the accuracy of the other method\nin the literature. The results in Table 4 explain that the TLBO\nscenario 1 accuracy is higher than the other DGA in litera-\nture, especially the modiﬁed new approach DGA in [6]. The\naccuracy difference between the traditional DGA techniques\n(Duval triangle, IEC, Rogers) with TLBO scenario 1 is high\nas in Table 4 where the diagnostic accuracies of Duval tri-\nangle method, IEC code 60599, Rogers 4 ratios, TLBO sce-\nnario 1 are 60.88, 50.26, 44.72, and 86.27, respectively. The\nclosest diagnostic accuracy is for the modiﬁed new approach\nDGA, which is 84.71. It is obvious from Table 4, although the\ndiagnostic accuracies of PD, D1, T3 are decreased in TLBO\nscenario 1 than that in the modiﬁed new approach DGA, but\nthe diagnostic accuracies improved for D2, T1, T2.\nDue to the interfaces between the transformer faults,\nthe diagnostic accuracy of TLBO scenario 1 is 86.27%, which\nis higher than the other DGA techniques in the literature as\nshown in Table 4. Therefore, a new attempt is provided to\ndecipher the interfaces between converging faults such as\ndischarge faults (PD, D1, and D2) and thermal faults (T1, T2,\nand T3) by assuming new gas ratios, which is considered one\nof the most objectives of this study to enhance the accuracy\nof diagnosis. In [6], the limits of the gases’ ratios were\npresented, but the diagnostic accuracy of the investigated\nsamples did not exceed 85%, then, the TLBO is applied to\nimprove the gases’ ratio limits to increase the diagnostic\naccuracy of the transformer fault. The optimized gas concen-\ntration limits and gases’ ratios are presented in Tables 5 and 6,\nrespectively.\nB. DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF TLBO SCENARIO 2\nIn the TLBO scenario 2, several gases’ ratios in addition to\nthe gas concentration percentages are developed to separate\nthe interfaces occurring between fault types, such as the\ninterfaces between PD, D1, and D2 for the discharge faults\nand between T1, T2, and T3 for thermal faults. The TLBO is\napplied on the 386 data samples as percentage concentration\nof the gases and the gases’ ratios. The gases’ ratios are\nindicated in Equation (3).\nThe limits of the percentage gases’ concentrations and the\ngases’ ratios are explained in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. The\npercentages of gases’ concentrations in Table 5 are different\nthan those in Table 4 because the TLBO scenario 2 consid-\nered several additional inputs such as the gases’ ratios. The\n30824 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. S. M. Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\nFIGURE 4. Flow chart of the second version of the proposed DGA approach (TLBO Scenario 2).\nprocedures to compute the diagnostic accuracy of the TLBO\nscenario 2 are carried out based on the stages in the ﬂowchart\nin Fig. 4. The difference between the ﬂowchart in Fig. 2 and\nFig. 4 is the ability to separate between the interfaces’ faults\nor correct the incorrect diagnosis of fault type by consid-\nering the gases’ ratios in Equation (3). For example, if the\nconcentrations of the ﬁve gases 105, 23, 13, 4, and 3 ppm\nfor H 2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, and C 2H2, respectively, then the\npercentages of the gases’ concentrations according to the sum\nof ﬁve gases are 70.945, 15.54, 8.783, 2.7, and 2.02. Applying\nthe gases’ limits in Table 5 on the previous examples leads to\nthe fault type is PD, which is compatible with the actual fault\ntype, but when applying the gases’ limits in Table 2 on the\nprevious sample the fault type is an undetermined fault (UD),\nwhich is incorrect.\nAs in the ﬂowchart of TLBO scenario 2 in Fig. 4, the fault\norder is PD, D1, D2, T1, T2, and T3. This order doesn’t\ncause any problem because the gases’ percentages of any\nsample are checked for all fault types and then the order is\nnot important. For example, if the concentrations of the ﬁve\ngases 105, 23, 13, 4, and 3 ppm for H 2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and\nC2H2, respectively, then the percentages of the gases’ concen-\ntrations according to the sum of ﬁve gases are 70.945, 15.54,\n8.783, 2.7, and 2.02, respectively. Applying the gases’ limits\nin Table 5 on the previous examples leads to the PD fault type\nbecause the gases’ percentages satisfy the gas percentages’\nlimits of the PD, then the gases’ percentages are checked for\nthe gases’ percentage limits of D1, which cannot satisfy the\ngases’ limit of D1 (the gases’ percentage of CH 4 is 15.54 in\nthe applied sample and the gases’ limit of CH 4 for D1 must\nbe less than 13.6). After that, the gases’ percentages of a\nsample are checked for D2, and it is obvious that the gases’\npercentage doesn’t satisfy the gases’ percentage limit of D2\n(the gases’ percentage of H 2 is 70.945 and the gas percentage\nlimit of H 2 for D2 fault must be less than 63). When the\ngases’ percentages of the applied sample are checked with\nthe other faults T1, T2, and T3, the gases’ percentage of\nH2 for these faults differs from the gas percentage of H 2\nof the applied sample. Therefore, the gases’ percentage of\nthe applied sample satisﬁes only PD. It is obvious that the\norder of the faults in the ﬂowchart is not important because\nthe applied sample is checked for all possible faults. On the\nother hand, if the applied gases’ percentage of the sample\nsatisﬁes two fault types, then the role of gas ratio appears for\nseparating between these interface faults.\nTable 7 illustrates the confusion matrix of TLBO\nscenario 2, which was constructed based on the optimal gas\npercentage and ratio limits to enhance the diagnostic accuracy\nof transformer faults. Based on the optimal gas percentage\nand ratio limits in Tables 5 and 6, it is obvious that the\nnumber of correct diagnosis samples is increased for all fault\ntypes except D2 where the number of correct PD diagnose\nincreases from 37 for TLBO scenario 1 to 40 for TLBO\nscenario 2. Therefore, the results in Table 7 demonstrate the\nVOLUME 9, 2021 30825\nS. S. M. Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\nTABLE 7. Confusion matrix for TLBO Scenario 2 (Gas percentage and ratio limits).\nTABLE 8. Comparison between TLBO scenario 2 and the other DGA techniques in literature for constructing data (386 data samples).\nimportance of the gas ratio limits for enhancing the diagnostic\naccuracy of the transformer faults. The confusion matrix also\ndescribed the overall accuracy of the TLBO scenario 2 where\nthe correct diagnose samples are 343 out of 386 samples with\nan accuracy of 88.86%.\nThe limits of percentage gases and the gases’ ratios are\napplied on the 386 data samples and the diagnostic accuracy\nresults are shown in Table 8. Further, the diagnostic accuracy\nof the TLBO scenario 1 is enhancing by applying TLBO\nscenario 2 where the diagnostic accuracy for 386 data samples\nincreases from 86.27 % for TLBO scenario 1 to 88.86 %\nfor TLBO scenario 2. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of\nTLBO scenario 2 is higher than the diagnostic accuracies\nof several DGA methods in literature as in Table 8 where\nthe highest diagnostic accuracy after TLBO scenario 2 is\nthat for conditional probability (85.75), which is addressed\nin [36], [37]. Based on the comparison results between the\nproposed DGA techniques using TLBO scenario 2 and the\nother DGA techniques in literature, which were illustrated\nin Table 4, the diagnostic accuracy of the TLBO scenario 2\nwas higher than all DGA techniques except the modiﬁed\nnew approach DGA. The modiﬁed new approach DGA gives\na diagnostic accuracy of 83.51% for testing samples which\nis higher than the diagnostic accuracy of TLBO scenario 2,\nwhich gave 82.02% but the diagnostic accuracy of TLBO\nscenario 2 is higher than a modiﬁed new approach DGA in\ncase of training sample (88.86 % for TLBO scenario 2 and\n84.71 % for a modiﬁed new approach DGA). Therefore,\nthe diagnostic accuracy of TLBO scenario 2 has a signiﬁcant\nlevel.\nFigure 5 shows the computed variables for scenarios 2\nwhere the computed gas concentration percentages are rep-\nresented by 35 lines as well as the gas ratios represented\nby 11 lines (in total 46 lines). The successful converge of\nthe proposed TLBO scenario 2 to diagnose the transformer\nfaults when all lines are being ﬁxed after their ﬂuctuations\noccur in the beginning. Regarding the computed objective\nfunction (agreement), Fig. 6 shows its convergence curve\nby the TLBO algorithm (Scenarios 1 and 2). Interestingly,\nboth curves of the two scenarios are converged to opti-\nmal solutions. It is important to note that the calculated\noptimal agreement value of scenario 2 is better than that\nof scenario 1. For example, the calculated optimal agree-\nment value of scenario 2 is 343 which is much higher than\nscenario 1 (333).\nThe diagnostic accuracy of TLBO scenario 2 is tested\nwith additional 89 data samples that are collected from lit-\nerature to investigate its robustness. The distribution of the\n89 data samples according to the fault types and the sources\nis explained in Table 9. The distribution of the data samples\naccording to fault types is 8 samples for PD, 13 for D1, 19 for\nD2, 13 for T1, 7 for T2, and 29 data samples for T3. The\n89 data samples are new samples, which are different than\nthe 386 data samples that are used to construct the TLBO\nscenario 2 models.\nThe diagnostic accuracy of TLBO scenario 2 is compared\nwith the other DGA methods in literature as in Table 10. All\nDGA methods in literature gave diagnostic accuracies less\nthan the TLBO scenario 2 except the modiﬁed new approach\nDGA in [6] where a slight difference is observed between the\n30826 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS.

Convergence curve of the objective function by the TLBO algorithm (Scenarios 1 and 2).\naccuracy of TBLO scenario 2 and the modiﬁed new approach\nDGA and this difference is 1.13%.\nSome of the numerical examples to represent the math-\nematical modeling of the proposed algorithm is illustrated.\nTable 11 explains 6 data samples expressing the six trans-\nformer faults. For sample 1, the gases’ percentage for actual\nPD fault is computed as (92.19, 6.76, 0.91, 0.14, and 0\n% for H 2%, CH 4%, C 2H6%, C 2H4%, and C 2H2%, respec-\ntively), the number is rounded to the nearest two decimal\nnumber. The gases’ percentage was compared with the pro-\nposed TLBO scenario 2 gases’ percentage limits in Table 5\nand it is observed that the computed gases’ percentage was\nﬁtted with the gases’ percentage limits of PD and D1. There-\nfore, the proposed gases’ ratios in (3) were investigated to\nseparate between PD and D1 faults, the controlling ratios\nbetween PD and D1 are r 2, r 3, and r 4. When computing\nthe r 2 and r 4, the results indicated that they also satisfy the\ntwo faults PD and D1, but r 3 for D1 must be greater than\nVOLUME 9, 2021 30827\nS. S. M.

Sample No. 2 is\ninvestigated, when the gas percentage as the previous order\nis 21.96, 23.92, 29.41, 12.55, and 12.16%, then compared\nthese gases percentage with the proposed TLBO scenario 2\ngases’ percentage in Table 5. The gas percentage of sam-\nple 2 did not ﬁt with PD and D1 faults, then the other\ngases limits are checked, and the gases’ percentages were\nﬁt only with D2. Then the diagnostic fault is D2 which is\nnot compatible with the actual fault D1 and then the TLBO\nfails to diagnose the fault correctly. For sample 3 and based\non the gases’ percentage limits in Table 5, the computed\ngases’ percentage of sample 3 was ﬁt only with D2 and it\ndid not interface with another fault and then the checking of\ngases’ ratio limits was not required. The gases’ percentage\nof sample 4 as in Table 11 were 31.58, 47.37, 10.53, 10.53,\nand 0 %, checking the TLBO scenario 2 gases’ percentage\nlimits in Table 5 to identify the fault type. After checking the\nprocess, the gas percentage of sample 4 expressed the T1 fault\nonly, then the TLBO scenario 2 diagnose is correct. For the\ngases’ percentage of sample 5, the gases’ percentage limit\nproposed by TLBO scenario 2 referred that their interfaces\nbetween T2 and T3 faults and then the gases’ ratio limits must\nbe checked. The controlling gas ratio that refers to T2 is r 7\n(C2H4/C2H6) where it must be lower than 3.7. the computed\nr7 based on the sample 5 data is 2.25, then the diagnostic fault\nis T2 and then TLBO scenario 2 detects the fault correctly.\nSample no. 6 is investigated, the gases’ percentage of this\nsample ﬁtted only with T3 for TLBO scenario 2 and then\nTLBO diagnosis is correct where the actual fault is T3.\n30828 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. S. M. Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\nTABLE 12. The effect of uncertainty noise on the diagnostic accuracy of TLBO scenario 2.\nThe uncertainty in the measurement approach is applied to\nthe data samples to investigate the robustness of the TLBO\nscenario 2 DGA algorithm by changing the data for 5 %,\n10 %, 15% 20%, and 25%. The data of the samples are varied\nusing equation (13) as in [37],\nNl =[100 −m +(2m ×Rl)] /100 (13)\nwhere Nl refers to the vector of noise, l indicates the num-\nber of testing samples (89 testing samples), m is the per-\ncentage uncertainty level (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%),\nand Rl ranges from 0 to 1. After developing the Nl vector,\nit multiplies in the gas concentration of each gas [H2new] =\n[Nl] [H2%] and the new sum of the gases is developed based\non the new percentage of gas concentration. When the TLBO\nscenario 2 DGA is applied, the same diagnostic accuracies\nwith the uncertainty noises are developed and when the\nresults are investigated, a surprising observation is concluded.\nThe observation is when the uncertainty noise is applied of\nthe gases’ vectors the sum of the gases varies with the same\nuncertainty noise and then when the new gases’ concentra-\ntions are divided by the sum, the same gases’ percentages\nwithout uncertainty noise are obtained and then the uncer-\ntainty in case of using the gases’ percentage is not effective.\nFor example, when the gases’ concentrations are 117, 17,\n1, 3, 1 ppm for H 2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, and C 2H2, respec-\ntively, then the percentage gases’ concentrations according\nto the sum of the gases are 84.17, 12.23, 0.719, 2.15, and\n0.719 %. When the random Nl is 1.048842 and is multiplied\nin the gases’ concentrations, the new gases concentrations are\n122.7145, 17.8303, 1.048842, 3.1465, and 1.048842 ppm for\nH2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, and C 2H2, respectively, and the sum\nof the new gases’ concentrations are 145.7889 ppm and then\nthe new percentages of the gases’ according to the new sum\nare 84.17, 12.23, 0.719, 2.15, and 0.719 %, which are the\nsame percentage gases’ concentrations without uncertainty,\ntherefore, the uncertainty noise doesn’t inﬂuence on the per-\ncentage of the gases and then the diagnostic accuracies using\nuncertainty noises are not varied rather than that without\nuncertainty noises.\nOn the other hand, if the noise interfaces inﬂuence on\nsingle gas as H 2 with uncertainty noise of 5 % and 20 %,\nTable 12 illustrates the accuracy of the TLBO scenario 2 with\nconsidering 5 % and 20 % uncertainty noise. The uncertainty\nresults in Table 12 indicated that at 5 % uncertainty of H 2,\nthe overall accuracy of the 88.34% with an error (0.584 %) of\nthe accuracy without uncertainty. Furthermore, when the H 2\nconcentration is varied with 20 % uncertainty noise, the accu-\nracy will be 85.233 % with an error of 4.08 %. Therefore,\nthe uncertainty noise that affects the gas concentration has an\ninsigniﬁcant effect on the accuracy of the TLBO scenario 2.\nThe paper has presented a new application of teaching-\nlearning based optimization for detecting the transformer\nfaults based on the concentrations of the dissolved gases. The\ninterfaces of some faults such as PD, D1, and D2 and also the\ninterfaces between T1, T2, and T3 may reduce the diagnostic\naccuracy of the proposed method. Some proposed methods\nincrease the diagnostic accuracy by emerging some of the\ninterface faults such as D1, and D2 and also T1, T2, and T3.\nThe proposed work using TLBO did not emerge the different\nfaults and if the estimated fault is not ﬁt with the actual fault\nthen the diagnostic accuracy is zero for this sample.\nC. SEVERITY OF TRANSFORMER FAULT TYPES\nAccording to IEEE C57.104 [2], the severity of the fault\ncan be determined based on the total amount of dissolved\ncombustion gases (TDCG), which is the sum of the main\ncombustible gases such as H 2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, C 2H2,\nand CO, and its rate of change. It explains the maintenance\nstrategy, the periodic tests, and the recommended action that\nmust be considered based on the TDCG and its rate of change.\nSeveral datasets were collected concerning the history of\nDGA results of one transformer in the Egyptian power net-\nworks. The proposed TLBO algorithm and other DGA tech-\nniques to identify both the transformer fault type and severity\nof this fault based on the total amount of TDCG. In addi-\ntion, the recommended action based on TDCG is provided.\nTable 13 illustrates the collected data, and Table 14 demon-\nstrates the results of the TLBO and other DGA tech-\nniques for the transformer oil samples during its operation.\nTable 14 shows the fault severity as a condition of the fault\ntype where ‘‘1’’ refers to the TDCG ranges from 0-720 ppm\nand indicates the low fault type, further ‘‘2’’ refers to the\nrange of TDCG more than 720 to 1920 ppm and indicates the\nVOLUME 9, 2021 30829\nS.

The\nlast condition is ‘‘4’’ where the TDCG is more than 4630 ppm\nand it indicates an extreme fault so that the transformer must\nbe urgently removed from the network. The fault types of\nTLBO and other DGA techniques of the collected oil sample\nfor the tested transformer are also presented whereas most\ndiagnostic fault types were matched with the actual faults.\nAs shown in Table 13, the concentration of the combustible\ngases, for sample number 3, increased and exceeded the\nnormal rate of all gases. Then, the TDCG was excessive\nand the fault type will be classiﬁed as high thermal faults.\nSubsequently, the oil temperature exceeds 700 ◦C, that is\ncorresponding to condition ‘‘4’’ referring that the transformer\nmust be out of service. The time that the TLBO was taken\nto identify the transformer fault type and severity in the case\nof the testing process for 89 data samples was 89.3 ms per\nsample. While the training time of transformer fault datasets\nequals 5.43 min.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, the TLBO has been used to enhance the diag-\nnostic accuracy of the transformer faults by adjusting the\npercentage gases’ concentration limits and the gases’ ratios\nthrough the proposed two scenarios. The TLBO scenario 2\nhas enhanced the diagnostic accuracy with a reasonable limit\nwhere it gave a diagnostic accuracy of 88.86 % for training\nsamples and 82.02% for the testing samples. These diagnostic\naccuracies are higher than that of the traditional and recent\nDGA methods where the maximum diagnostic accuracy of\n30830 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. S. M. Ghoneimet al.: Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy of Transformer Faults Using TLBO\nthe other DGA methods is for the probability DGA method\n(85.75%, for training), which is reduced to 78.65% for the\ntesting samples. The modiﬁed new approach DGA gave a\nhigher accuracy than the TLBO scenario 2 for the testing data\n(83.15%) but it only gave 84.71% for the training samples.\nThe uncertainty noises with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% are applied to\nthe data samples to investigate the robustness of the TLBO\nscenario 2 and the application of the uncertainty noise was\nnot effective when the percentage gases according to its sum\nhas been used for DGA diagnoses. The proposed approach is\na helpful tool that could have a signiﬁcant effect variation on\ntransformer health by providing an accurate early diagnostic\nor prediction of expected transformer fault types.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the ﬁnancial sup-\nport received from Taif University Researchers Supporting\nProject Number (TURSP-2020/34), Taif University, Taif,\nSaudi Arabia.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Mineral Oil-Filled Electrical Equipment in Service—Guidance on the\nInterpretation of Dissolved and Free Gases Analysis, IEC Standard IEC\n60599, IEC, Geneva, Switzerland, Edition 2.1, May 2007.\n[2] IEEE Draft Guide for the Interpretation of Gases Generated in Oil-\nImmersed Transformers, IEEE Standard PC57.104/D6, Nov. 2018.\nAccessed: Dec. 10, 2020.
