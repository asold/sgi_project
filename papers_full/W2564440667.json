INTRODUCTION\nFacing intense competition and the inability to meet \nan increasingly growing demand, makes healthcare \norganizations to seek structural and organizational \nchanges in order to achieve performance improvement. \nImplementation of Lean methodology in healthcare \nestablishments is known as Lean healthcare, and it has \nbeen a growing alternative in terms of quality pursuit, being \nbased on patient’s needs and saving resources that can bring \npositive results concerning quality of care and costs. Cheng  \net al., (2015) corroborates with that vision affirming that the \napplication of Lean in healthcare over the past decade has \nbeen associated with increased quality, safety and efficiency \nby improving clinical processes.\nLooking to adopt Lean philosophy in health services, \nmany organizations have adopted different approaches and \nimprovement strategies. There are a large variety of tools \nand techniques which can be used by health organizations \nin this regard. For example, Aguila-Escobar  et Garrido-\nVeja (2012) discussed the applicability of Lean principles \nin the supply chain management of a hospital through the \nimplementation of the Kanban system. McClean  et al., (2007) \nshowed the use of a Markov Model to identify more efficient \npatients’ routes in a hospital, which could also be associated \nwith healthcare process improvement technologies such \nas Lean Thinking and Six Sigma methodology. Studies of \nDiGioia  et al., (2015) show integration of two approaches by \nadding the Patient and Family Centered Care Methodology \nand Practice (PFCCM / P) to Lean methodology. According \nto the authors, by integrating two approaches we can keep \nthe patient (and family) as the main focus for improvement \nactivities and accelerate the pace of improvements.\nSeveral other approaches and techniques related to Lean \nhave been described in the literature, for example, Cheng  \net al., (2015) showed papers where Lean is applied through \nvarious approaches, and show results such as improvements \nin quality of health services and cost reduction. In this sense, \nincorporation of Lean healthcare management processes \ncan bring benefits to healthcare organizations based on \nmany success stories. However, McIntoshi  et al.,  (2014) \nsaid there is still no evidence in literature that supports the \nacceptance of Lean success in health services concerning \nstrategic objectives. In this context, knowing the tools \nand techniques that makes application of Lean Healthcare \npossible can contribute to a better understanding of Lean \napproach in health services.\nIn this sense, this paper has the objective of building a \nsystematic literature review from a survey conducted from \nSCOPUS database in order to know which are the main \ntechniques and most used tools for the implementation of \nLean philosophy in healthcare. We also discuss concepts \nsuch as Agile  et Leagile. Section 2 presents the research \nmethodology used in the search for references and data \nanalysis. In section 3 the concepts of Lean, Lean healthcare, \nAgile  et Leagile are presented based on references. Section \n4 presents a detailed analysis of what have been published \non Lean Healthcare, in addition, this section also presents \na scheme detailing the main techniques for applying the \nLean concept in health care based on articles found. Section \n5 presents discussion of obtained results and Section 6 \npresents conclusions of the paper\n2. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThis study is characterized as a systematic literature \nreview on Lean Healthcare. The systematic review requires a \nrigorous methodological framework. Therefore, the content \nanalysis is an effective tool for analyzing a sample of research \ndocuments in a systematic way (SEURING  et GOLD, 2012). \nThe model proposed by Seuring  et Gold (2012) to conduct a \nsystematic review by content analysis consists of four steps:\n1- Collecting material, \n2- Descritive analysis, \n3- Category selection,  \n4- Material assessment.\nThe first step was taken from the search publications \nperformed by finding literature production in SCOPUS \ndatabase using the string “Lean Healthcare”. The search \ntook place in August 2015, have resulted in a total of 612 \npublications. Then an initial screening of publications found \nby checking titles and abstracts was performed, aiming \nto discard those that did not fit within the scope of this \nresearch, resulting in 277 articles ranging from the years \n2002 to 2015. To organize publications we used Mendeley \nDesktop reference management tool.\nThe second step is reading of the texts in which could \nbe identified the central idea of the articles and the main \nresults found by the authors. From the information collected, \nanalyses were performed sorting the papers by year of \npublication, country, major authors, journals, among others.\nThird step was a paper categorization based on criteria \nshown in Figure 1. A conceptual model was created, where \nthe criteria are divided into three main blocks, and then, \ndivided again into subcategories: \n1- General paper information concerns year of \npublication, journal title, journal country and \nauthor \n2- Research method: Papers were sorted as \nconceptual and practical. Conceptual papers are \nthose which assess what is being published about \nLean Healthcare. Most of them are literature \nreviews. Practical papers are considered those \nwhich bring applications and case studies.\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n408\n3- Approach: This section sorts the papers as \nquantitative and qualitative. Quantitative papers \nwere considered those, which bring numerical \nexamples. Qualitative papers were considered \nthose that bring framework and methodological \napplications.\n3. LITERATURE REVIEW\nThis section aims to discuss how Lean philosophy is being \napplied to Healthcare organizations. We also bring discuss \nconcepts such as Agile  et Leagile (AGARWAL  et al., 2006).\n3.1 Lean Concepts\nIn recent years, there is a growing interest regarding \nstudies and implementation of “Lean Manufacturing” \nconcept, as well as broader concepts such as “Lean \nCompany “. The main focus of lean approach is elimination \nof excess. The consolidation of Toyota Production System \ncan be considered the key to popularization of large-scale \nlean production systems, which has strong emphasis on \neliminating waste (AGARWAL  et al., 2006). The authors \nalso claim that the Lean policy works well in environments \nwhere demand is relatively stable, predictable, and there \nis little variety. Lean policy, can even function as an agility \nelement occasionally, but will not always be enough to meet \ncustomers’ demands.\nMany industries are adopting new business tactics in \norder to survive in the new market logic, and in this sense, \nwaste disposal becomes a critical survival issue (ARADHYE  \net KALLURKAR, 2014).\nProduction systems that use large stocks, large lots and \nuninterrupted production, increasingly give way to more \nflexibility, in order to get more competitive systems, thus \nmaking Lean Production and Lean Manufacturing systems \nas some of the most popular around the world (ARADHYE et \nKALLURKAR, 2014; KOJIMA, 2008).\nIn this context, Muda is the term for an activity that \nis considered wasteful and does not add value or is \nunproductive. Lean suggests that in order to create capacity \nin the workplace we are best off identifying areas of waste \nand working towards eliminating them from our processes. \nGenerally there are seven wastes primary root causes for \ninefficiency within the work space (waiting, stock, over-\nprocessing, quality errors, motion, transportation, and \nprocessing)\nTable 1 brings recent studies and applications of Lean \nconcepts:\nTable 1 - Papers concerning Lean initiatives. \nAuthors Methods and highlights\nLin, 2011\nApplication of VMI for obtaining Lean Supply. The design \nof a lean inventory management system needs a system \ndesigned to incorporate all relevant constraints on the \nsystem.\nThe author argues that for a complex chain, inventory \nmanagement system should be Lean.\nBehrouzi  \net al., \n2011\nThe paper collects data from 133 Iranian automotive \ncompanies. It Creates a set of performance measures \nbased on four components: Elimination of waste, \ncontinuous improvement, flexibility and JIT (Just-in-Time).\nMartínez-\nJurado  et \nMoyano-\nFuentes, \n2013\nThis paper brings Literature assessment of connections \nbetween concepts such as Lean Management, Supply \nChain Management and Sustainability. There are significant \ngaps in the literature as regards sustainability applied to \nlean supply chain management.\nChen et \nal., 2013\nThis study applies Lean Production and RFID (Radio \nFrequency Identification) to improve effectiveness in a \nSupply Chain. The authors also show savings achieved for \nthe chain as a whole with application of Lean techniques.\nTritos et \nal., 2013\nAuthors show a holistic approach to prioritizing Lean \nSCM (Supply Chain Management) initiatives applied to \nHealthcare. A Fuzzy AHP method was used to prioritize \nthe categories: Continuous Improvement Process, JIT flow \nmanagement, enterprise integration and elimination of \nwaste. The results indicate that continuous improvement \nis a dominant Lean SCM initiative due to financial and \noperational performance focus.\nManzouri \net \nal.,2014\nStudy aimed to identify the best Lean tools from 300 \nquestionnaires distributed in food firms in Malaysia. \nThe results showed that collaborative demand planning, \ncontinuous improvement and good inventory management \npractices are the most important tools for Lean Supply \nChain.\nSafaei, \n2014\nThe study presents a multi-objective programming model. \nThe example brought by the authors show costs and waste \nminimization, leading to conclude that operations research \nmodels are good approaches.\nSource: The authors own.\nTable 1 analysis shows that authors reinforce basic \nprinciples of Lean, such as elimination of waste in all \nits forms, with greater emphasis on inventory, besides \nstrong inclination for the application of VSM. We can also \nFigure 1 - Classification framework.\nSource: The authors own.\n\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n409\nhighlight the fact that continuous process improvement is \na prerequisite for obtaining a lean production system. The \nauthors also emphasize the importance of using quantitative \ntechniques, such as Operations Research to find optimum \ncost.\n3.2 Agile Concepts\nIn light of this discussion, there is still the fact that there \nare risks inherent in building a lean system. These risks have \nalready broken organizational boundaries and can pose \nrisks to the entire supply chain. This fact drew attention of \nauthors such as Tang et Muse (2011); Jutner et al., (2003); \nThun et Hoenig (2011), among others. Thun et Hoenig (2011) \nwork with the concept of Supply Chain Risk Management, \nwhich would be the risk management discussion that are \nnot restricted to just one tier in the chain, but risks that can \ncompromise business processes going through one or all of \nthe companies in a Supply Chain.\nThe balance of these risks is not an easy task. For \nbuilding a Lean Supply Chain, it is imperative to include \nbusiness process coordination tools, as well as maturity \nand integration between all parties. There is also need for \nprocess mapping, reduction of intermediate stocks, among \nother challenges. However, if coordination is not possible in \nthe whole Supply Chain, or if the environment is subject to a \ndegree of uncertainty, the buffers are tend to increase along \nthe chain, margins decrease and competitiveness weakens. \nSome researchers believe that speed is associated with \nefficiency and consider it fundamentally different from lean \nlogic (GOLDSBY et al.,2006).\nClassically, Lee (2002) states that companies should use \nAgile philosophy in a more uncertain environment and \nLean philosophy in environments with more stability. This \npremise is questioned by Gligor et al., (2014) who claim that \nAgile philosophy works equally well in stable environments.\nAgility is considered a key attribute for all organizations in a \nbusiness environment subject to many uncertainties (BALAJI \net al.,2014; SANGARI et al.,2015). Over time, the idea that \ncompanies must be agile is consolidating more and more \n(Gligor et HOMCOMB, 2012ª; Gligor et al.,2014.). Gligor et \nal., (2014) define mobility of a Supply Chain as the ability \nof a company to quickly adjust their tactics and operations \nto changes in the environment. The Agility is defined as the \nability of a chain to use its resources to quickly respond to \nenvironmental changes (LI et al.,2008). Naylor et al., (1999) \ndefine agility as the ability to use market knowledge and a \nvirtual corporation to exploit profitable opportunities in a \nvolatile market environment.\nAgile philosophy involves rapid setup and removal of \nwastes, however, such elimination is not considered a \nprerequisite (NAYLOR et al.,1999). For Balaji et al., (2014), \nmobility can be achieved by improving the relationship \nbetween buyers and suppliers in a supply chain.\n3.3 Leagile Concepts\nUp to this point, Lean et Agile paradigms were presented, \nhowever, Lean et Agility paradigms are no longer sufficient \nto generate competitiveness in business. Nowadays, it is \nnecessary that the lean concept is applied in conjunction \nwith agility concept and so, the term Leagility is coined and \nis discussed, for example in Naylor et al., (1999) and most \nrecently in Huang et Li (2010). The term leagile comes from \nthe hybrid combination of the lean and agile concepts, and \nthe appropriate concept in the supply chain will depend \nupon the requirements of the customer. \nMany researchers came up with the term “Decoupling \nPoint” (See Cristopher, 2000; Cristopher et Towill, 2000; \nMason-Jones et al., 2000). The idea was that a point of \ndecoupling separates processes that would work on the Lean \nlogic and processes that would work in Agile Logic (HUANG \net LI, 2010; PRICE et KAY , 2000; VAN DER WORST et al.,2001). \nTable 2 summarizes papers that discuss agile concept.\nTable 2 - Papers using “agile” concept\nAuthors Methods and Highlights\nWang et al., \n2011\nThe paper emphasizes the importance of flexibility \nand applies Mobile Agent system, which facilitates the \nexchange of information among other benefits. The \nresearch also points out that the competitions are \namong chains and no longer between companies and \nhighlights how Mobile Agent type systems facilitate \nthe agile production.\nGhahremanloo \net Tarokh, \n2011\nThe authors Propose an ACSM (Agile Supply Chain \nManagement) based on multi-agent systems. The \nmodel is validated using multi-objective fuzzy linear \nprogramming and is able to select the best supplier in \naccordance with a combination of agility criteria in a \noptimized mathematical model.\nChen et al., \n2011\nThis study analyzes the behavior of agile supply chains \nusing dynamic systems. For agile supply chain, the \ndelivery rate can be adjusted not only by changing \nthe order cycle time but also through targeted stock \nchange.\nBenzheng, \n2011\nThe author develops the scheme of incentive from \nthe economic theory of the principal agent. For \nexample, suppliers can take improper actions that are \ngood for them, but bad for the chain.  \nLei et wang, \n2012\nThe authors emphasize the importance of an agile \ninventory management in a supply chain. Agile \ninventory management in a supply chain can improve \nthe management of a company using parameters \nsuch as fast and appropriate decision-making \nprocess, lower production cycles, efficiency gains in \nproduction, among others.\nAmeri et Pati, \n2012\nThis study explains the multi-agent system called \nDigital Manufacturing Market (DMM), which is a \nmulti-agent system that connects the chain links and \nallows reconfiguration of the processes. \nSamantra et \nal., 2013\nThe paper uses use fuzzy logic to evaluate agility in a \nsupply chain. The study was applied to an automotive \nchain in India. The authors bring a summary of the \nmain techniques for measuring speed on a CS. The \nintrinsic characteristics of fuzzy logic make it a good \ntechnique to represent imprecise human judgments. \nThe model provides a quantitative approach to \nestimate the degree of agility.\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n410\nLing et Feng, \n2013\nSelection of partners consists of one key problem in \nbuilding an agile CS. The authors use optimization \nby ant colony. The paper presents the mathematical \ndescription of the model.\n Balaji et al., \n2014\nThey use a methodology called Agile Supply Chain \nTransformation Matrix (ASTM). The ASCTM tool is \nbuilt on QFD to identify the interaction between \nbusiness practices and AHP as method to support \nmulti-criteria decision. The authors present a \nsuccessful case in a medium-sized company. The \nauthors conclude that the ASCTM will provide basis \nfor evaluating processes and help companies to \nsurvive in unstable environments\nYusuf et al., \n2014\nThe paper evaluates the link between dimensions \nof an Agile Supply Chain, competitive goals and \nperformance in an oil and gas British  company. 880 \nquestionnaires were applied to identify agility criteria. \nThe article identifies the most important dimensions \nand attributes of an agile SC and emphasizes \nthe importance of chain competition instead of \ncompetition between firms.\nGligor et al., \n2015\nThe article brings a question about the possibility \nof the agile philosophy work well in more stable \nenvironment. The technique used is the structural \nequation modeling. At the end, the study concludes \nthat agility has a positive effect on customer service \nbut conclude that there is still a agile firm to be \nefficient in costs\nSangari et al., \n2015\nThe paper combines fuzzy logic with ANP (Analytic \nNetwork Process) to create a framework in a chain \nthat wants to increase agility. For the automotive \nindustry presented, the method ranks the most \nimportant factors for agility\nSource: The authors own.\n3.4 Lean, Agile and Leagile concepts applied to Healthcare\nDue to a cost reduction emphasis, Lean methodologies \nhave become a consolidated set of practices and tools, \nwhich aim to improve processes while reducing costs. \nRecently, Lean practices are being applied to Healthcare \norganizations. Such practices led many researchers to coin \nthe term “Lean Healthcare”. Basically, a healthcare unit is a \nfacility which provides direct or indirect services to promote \nor keep individuals’ health condition (INTERNATIONAL \nPROFILES OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, 2012).\nLean manufacturing is a management approach aiming \nto improve the performance of an organization by reducing \nwaste, delays, etc. while involving staff in decision-making \n(BARIL et al., 2015). Lean basically consists in reducing \nwaste, in this context, long waiting times reduce healthcare \nquality and so, Lean offers a broad set of tools which can \nhelp healthcare organizations to relief the pressure of an \nenvironment with limited resources and a growing patient \npopulation (YU et al., 2015). Considering the increasing \nneeds for services in healthcare, hospital services must \nreview their practices to improve them and increase their \nperformance. Healthcare facilities look toward continuous \nimprovement approaches such as Lean manufacturing to \nimprove service delivery (HOUCHENS et KIM, 2014).\nLean implementation in healthcare requires adaptation \nand development to fit the specific context and allow \nhealthcare staff to take ownership of the approach \n(Poksinska, 2010). Lean Healthcare is one of the last \nmanagement imports to healthcare sector (Mazzocato et \nal.,2010), and is also a methodology that enables hospitals \nto improve patient care quality, support employees and \ndoctors, eliminate barriers and focus on providing care \n(Graban, 2012)\nDue to criteria such as publication year (the more recent, \nthe better) and Lean tools use, we constructed Table 3 , \nwhich shows the most relevant papers and its highlights.\nTable 3 - Lean Healthcare papers\nAuthors Methods and Highlights\nYu et al., 2015 The authors use VSM to redesign inefficient processes \nin an oncologic clinic. \nLasorsa et al., \n2015\nThe authors highlight the lack of a healthcare \nstandardized framework for implementing Lean \nHealthcare tools.

There were no papers, which \nbrought case studies of a purely agile Healthcare process. \nTable 4 shows papers found which show how to implement \nLeagile in Healthcare organizations.\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n411\nTable 4 - Leagile Healthcare papers\nAuthors Methods and Highlights\nRahimnia et \nMoghadasian, \n2010\nThe paper shows an application of leagility concepts \nin an Iranian hospital.

RESULTS\nFollowing the research method described in section 2, we \nfound 612 potentially relevant articles concerning the topic \nLean Healthcare. After initial filtering, we excluded articles \nthat did not fit in the scope of the research, resulting in 213 \narticles. After reading the texts, we excluded 38 articles \nthat did not have enough information to identify the lean \ntechnique or the tool applied, totaling 175 articles ranging \nfrom the years 2002 and 2015. \nThe sample  included publications from 2002 to 2015 . \nAn upward trend has been identified in the number \nof publications during the period, although we observed few \npublications in the early years and a peak occurred in \n2014.  Publications distribution can be seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 2:  published papers.\nSource: SCOPUS database\nWe also have identified the most relevant journals \nas shown in Figure 3. The journals in which were found \nmore publications on the subject Lean Heathcare were \n“Lean International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive \nAdvantage” and the “Journal for Healthcare Quality”, both \nwith 8 publications found.\nTable 5 classifies the authors with at least three \narticles published. Two authors had the highest number \nof publications and only one author presented three \npublications on lean healthcare.\nTable 5: Authors with at least 3 papers published.\nAuthor Papers Affiliation Country\nThanos \nPapadopoulos 4 University of \nSouthampton UK\nMatt Morissette 4 More Effective \nConsulting USA\nNicolo Curatolo 3 Arts et Metiers \nParis Tech France\nSource: SCOPUS database\nThe literature survey also  show 56 different techniques \nor tools used in the implementation of Lean Healthcare. As \ncan be seen in Figure 4, there is a variety of Lean tools and \ntechniques. The techniques most used by the authors were \nSix Sigma, Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Kaizen, 5S, process \nmapping/ improvement, simulation and PDCA / PDSA, being \nthe Six Sigma technique the most frequently cited. About 27 \nLean tools were cited only one time.\nFigure 5 shows distribution of articles for paper type. As \ncan be seen, the results show that there is a predominance \nof publications classified as practical / applied. Most \npublications in this category have one or more case studies \nor experience report to illustrate the application of Lean \nHealthcare.\n The tools and techniques identified in this review were \ncategorized as quantitative and qualitative. Considering the \n54 techniques identified, 13 were classified as quantitative \nand 41 as qualitative. Figure 6 shows the distribution of \nquantitative tools, being six sigma the most used. \nFigure 3: More relevant journals.\nSource: SCOPUS database\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n412\nFigure 7: Distribution of qualitative tools and techniques.\nSource: The authors own.\nFigure 4: Techniques found in the papers.\nSource: The authors own.\nFigure 5: Paper type.\nSource: The authors own.\nFigure 6: Distribution of quantitative techniques and tools.\nSource: The authors own.\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n413\nFigure 7 shows distribution of qualitative tools. The \nmost quoted technique was the Value Stream Mapping \n(VSM) with 36 occurrences. Note that even being six \nsigma a qualitative/quantitative approach, we considered \nit quantitative because, usually, it is a mostly quantitative \nmethodology.\nFigure 8 shows a model with a summary of the main \ntechniques and tools found in literature.\nDISCUSSION  \nBased on the results shown in section 4, we discuss \napplication of techniques used in Lean Healthcare (and also \ndiscuss agile and leagile concepts). This review included the \nmain techniques and tools considering the evidence from \nthe literature to determine how Lean can be applied in the \nhealth sector. D’ Andreamatteo et al., (2015) cited in his review \nthat it seems to exist in the literature a lack of uniformity in \nthe concepts of Lean, and so, a common definition of what \nis and what is not Lean should be established so that future \nprojects can be analyzed properly and strengthen research \nand practice.\nThe literature review showed that Six Sigma was the \nmost mentioned technique by the authors. According to \nYamamoto et al. (2010), Lean and Six Sigma work together \nto improve the overall performance. Several authors suggest \nbringing Lean and Six Sigma together resulting in Lean/Six \nSigma approach. Such an approach was notably used by \nseveral authors such as: AGUEZZOUL et NYOUNGUE, 2012; \nAL owad. 2014;. BHAT et al., 2015; BAHENSKY et al., 2005; \nBONILLA et al., 2008;. CALDWELL, 2006; Carboneau et al., \n2010; D’ ANDREAMATTEO et al., 2015;. GIJO et ANTONY , \n2014; Haenke and Stichler, 2015; HEUVEL et al., 2006; Hoerl \net Gardner, 2010; Huang et al., 2012; KOLLENGODE, 2008; \nKuo et al., 2011; MANDAHAWI, 2011; Mason et al., 2014; \nMozammel et al., 2011; NATALE et al., 2014; NICOLAY et al., \n2012;. PHIPPS, 2012; Sanders et KARR, 2015; VEST et GAMM, \n2009; WORKMAN-GERMANN et WOODWARD-HAGG, 2006; \nYamamoto et al., 2010; YU et al, 2008; Zandi et BORCHERS, \n2012. \nFigure 8: Tools categorization\nSource: The authors own.\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n414\nAlso according to Yamamoto (2010), Lean/Six Sigma has \nrecently been adapted for the healthcare industry with the \naim of eliminating activities that do not add value, reduce \nwaste, decrease the errors rate and variability in processes, \nin addition, aims to increase agility and process reliability. \nLean/Six Sigma showed a very widespread method and good \nresults which can be the cause of appearing so many times in \nliterature. However, D’ Andreamatteo (2015) states that the \nanalysis of the benefits and criticism of a joint application \nwith other techniques are still undervalued because in most \ncases the most common form of joint combinations with \nother methodologies is Lean/Six Sigma, in which is shown \nthat the joint implementation could overcome the weak \npoints of each system. \nThere is also some overlap between the tools and \ntechniques such as VSM, Kanban, 5S, Ishikawa and SIPOC \ndiagrams, which are usual techniques, but can be applied \nto as measuring tools for other methods. We can affirm that \nthis is what happens with the tools used in Lean/Six Sigma, \nwhich is a fairly comprehensive methodology that makes \nuse of several tools, and so, this research also noticed that \nmost of the tools mentioned by the authors include the set \nof tools and methods used by the Lean Six Sigma. Some tools \nlike PESTLE, Pareto, SWOT, brainstorming and benchmarking \nare not usually described as Lean tools, but were cited \nby authors as tools used in one or more stages of DMAIC \nframework (BHAT et al., 2015;. GIJO et ANTONY , 2014; \nMANDAHAWI et al., 2011.). However, eventually, authors \nalso used those tools as analysis’ tools without necessarily \nbeing part of Six Sigma (Cheng et al., 2015; CREMA et al., \n2015; CREMA et VERBANO, 2015; Robinson et al., 2012; \nTowill et Christopher, 2005). \nValue Stream Mapping Tool (VSM) was a widely used \ntool by most of authors, being used alone or in conjunction \nwith other tools. VSM represents key personnel, material, \nand information flows required to distinguish value-added \nsteps and steps with no value (Jimmerson et al.,2005). Most \narticles which used VSM, have combined the tool with other \ntechniques and tools, such as the work of Grove et al.,2010), \nVerbano Crema (2015) et Cheng et al., (2015). Even using only \nVSM can generate good results, allowing identification of \nwaste and some operational bottlenecks that interfere with \ntreatment of patients (Henrique et al.,2005). Among other \nbenefits, we can highlight a faster and controlled patient \nflow, with less waste and shorter waiting time (Demirli et \nBHUIYAN, 2015). In addition, the literature review showed \nthat the VSM is a widely used tool in the implementation \nof Lean/Six Sigma (VILLA, 2010; Trilling et al.,2010; Holden \net al.,2015; AL Owad et al.,2014; MANDAHAWI et al.,2011; \nBHAT et al.,2015;. proudlove et al.,2008).\nAccording to literature evidence, VSM has also been \nassociated with simulation technique as shown in papers \nsuch as Dogan Nutulmaz (2014), Bhat et al.,  (2015), \nRobinson et al., (2012). Doğan et Nutulmaz (2014) used the \nVSM and simulation techniques to improve the efficiency of \nhealthcare. The authors used the VSM to map the current \nand future states of patient flow and then each map was \nmodeled through simulation. Robinson et al., (2012) argue \nthat the most common use for discrete event simulation was \nin the form of an electronic VSM and the benefits of such \nhave been described as a display “dynamic” process that can \nbe used interactively with the additional benefit of being \nable to demonstrate the value stream mapping (VSM).\nKaizen has also been widely adopted by the authors \nsurveyed in this review. The Kaizen itself is not a tool but a \nphilosophy or practice that seeks continuous improvement \nprocesses in order to eliminate waste. However, in several \narticles have been cited the terms “kaizen Event “, “Rapid \nImprovement Event (RIE)” or “Kaizen Blitz” (NICHOLAS, \n2012; RADNOR et al., 2012; Mazzocato et al., 2011; CREMA \net al., 2015; MAZUR et al., 2012; LAGANGA, 2011; NAIK et al., \n2011; Taylor et al., 2014; ZANIN et al., 2011;. Venkateswara \net al., 2011; JACKSON et  MAZUR, 2011). According to \nNicholas (2012), “Kaizen event” is a procedure lasting 3 to 5 \ndays in which the team learns the Lean method, investigates \nthe process, and identifies the issues and causes and \nimplementing improvements. In this aspect, “Kaizen event”, \nRIA or “Kaizen Blitz” can be considered as a Lean tool and \nthe evidence found in the literature review shows that it is \nwidely used in the Lean Healthcare implementation process\nAnother Lean tool among the most cited was the 5S. This \ntool, although very simple, was useful to achieve the goals \nof Lean Healthcare. Esain et al., (2008) found in their study \nthat implementing 5S tool is useful for understanding the \nprocesses and sets out the steps to change.\nThis literature review has shown how diverse is the \nuse and implementation of Lean Healthcare tools and \ntechniques. The exploited literature showed the occurrence \nof studies, which have used one or two tools only, but also, \nshowed other studies adopting a much larger number. A \nquestion that arises is whether the mere fact of using a Lean \ntool transforms a health organization in a lean one. Grove \net al.,  (2010) mention that the recent focus on efficiency \ngains have led to a series of partial implementations of Lean, \nas with health managers who have tried to replicate the \nsuccess of others without understanding the fundamental \nprinciples of Lean. Therefore, critical determinants must be \nput in place before embarking on a Lean transformation. \nThese determinants have been adapted by the authors \nGrove et al., (2008) to an iceberg model shown in Figure 9.\nIn this iceberg implementation model of Lean tools \nand techniques Lean are the top of the iceberg and are \neasily identified and are often used for a quick fix, but an \nimplementation of closer Lean requires all tasks from the \nbottom to the top (Grove et al.,2008).\nBrazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management\nVolume 13, Número 4, 2016, pp. 406-420\nDOI: 10.14488/BJOPM.2016.v13.n4.a1\n415\n About “Leagile” concept, when we search SCOPUS data \nbase for the string “Leagile”, only 71 papers come up and \nwhen we narrow the search using the string “Healthcare” \nwithin “Leagile” results, only 5 documents came up. Reading \nthe 5 articles, we realized that only 3 really bring Healthcare \ncases of study. This means that studies concerning these \nsubjects are still in its infant stages and needs further studies. \n6.  CONCLUSION\nAs the main conclusion, we can highlight the still short \nnumber of papers studying Lean, Agile and Leagile practices \nand tools applied to healthcare organizations. Most of these \norganizations, which have tried to implement some of the \ntools, still do not fully understand the challenges and effort \nneeded for Lean practices. We also hope this review can help \nnew researchers, being a primary guide of what is already \nbeing published concerning the subject.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis is part of a scientific initiation program of CEFET/RJ. \nThe authors of this article would like to thank the CEFET/RJ \nfor the financial support offered through scientific initiation \nscholarship.\nREFERENCES\nAGARWAL, A.; SHANKAR, R.; TIWARI, M.K.
