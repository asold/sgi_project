    "abstract": "This paper proposes a power conversion topology involving a multi-winding transformer and converters. The fundamental idea is described with circuit diagrams, and the voltage output of the proposed topology is analyzed mathematically. The effectiveness of the topology is discussed with test results from a small-scale power conversion system. When conventional hardware consisting of two-level converters and a transformer is employed, multi-level voltage outputs can be applied to the transformer windings by the proposed method.",
