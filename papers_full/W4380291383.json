Researchers used various experi-\nmental approaches to understand how short- and long-term \ntool-use in humans modifies the body representation (BR) \nand body schema (BS) (Martel et al. 2019; Day et al. 2017, \nMcCormack et al. 2011; Miller et al. 2014), and how a sense \nof body ownership and a sense of agency (in the following \nreferred to as ‘ownership’ and ‘agency’), and feelings of \ncontrol over the tool and its movements emerge (Nava et al. \n2018; Jung and Hughes 2016). In this study we transferred \nand adapted a tool-use paradigm introduced by Miller et al. \n(2014) into an augmented reality (AR) environment and \nexplored whether effects on BS would be similar as those \nfound by Miller et al. (2014) in a real-world setting. Fur -\nther, we were interested in how the emergence of ownership \nand agency over the virtual tool would depend on induced \nchanges in BS and how this association would depend on \nthe type of feedback provided (vision-only or visuo-tactile \nfeedback).\nOwnership and agency\nOwnership refers to body parts being perceived as belonging \nto one’s own body and is the sense that “I am the one that is \ngoing to experience, e.g., when one’s body is moving regard-\nless of whether voluntarily or involuntarily” (Gallagher \n2000, p15). Agency is the feeling that actions or events are \nCommunicated by Melvyn A. Goodale.\n * Amir Jahanian Najafabadi \n amir.jahanian@uni-bielefeld.de\n1 Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Bielefeld University, \n33501 Bielefeld, Germany\n2 School of Business, Social and Decision Sciences, \nConstructor University Bremen, 28759 Bremen, Germany\n3 Department of Computer Science, University of Bremen, \n28359 Bremen, Germany\n1722 Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738\n1 3\nproduced by one's own body, and that the agent is the cause \nof its own action (Gallagher 2000, 2018).\nOwnership results from the integration of somatosensory \nand vestibular inputs, which correlates with activity of cer -\ntain brain structures corresponding to sensory processing \nand motor control (Tsakiris and Haggard 2005). Cardinali \net al (2012) & de Vignemont (2007) have further proposed \nthat the body schema (BS) becomes a source of ownership \nbecause it constitutes the spatial content of the bodily sensa-\ntions that localise bodily properties within the BS. As dem-\nonstrated by Ma and Hommel (2015), non-corporeal objects \ncan likewise be perceived as parts of one’s own body. This \nprovides evidence against the idea that ownership relies on \npre-existing, temporally stable top–down body models, thus \nsupporting bottom-up approaches (Ma & Hommel 2015). \nIn further support of this notion, D’ Angelo et al. (2018) \nrevealed a significant modulation of the sensorimotor rep -\nresentation of the arm by use of a virtual hand that moved \nsynchronously with their own hand movements. They further \nrevealed significant effects of ownership and agency on the \nBS during virtual hand training.\nIn addition, ownership and agency are subject to mul-\ntimodal integration like the internal models underlying \nmotor control and can be experimentally manipulated (Gre-\nchuta et al. 2017; Serino et al. 2013; Petkova et al. 2011; \nfor reviews on how ownership and agency are shaped by \nmultimodal inputs, cf Blanke 2012; Noel et al. 2018; Tsa-\nkiris et al. 2007; Wen and Imamizu 2022). However, little is \nknown about whether sensorimotor BS plasticity mediates \nownership and agency in virtual tool-use experiments (Rubo \nand Gamer 2019; Cardinali et al. 2021).\nTool‑use alters the body schema\nAccording to the dyadic model (for review: Cardinali et al. \n2011; Head and Holmes 1911), two distinct subcomponents \nconstitute the body representation: body image (BI) and \nbody schema (BS; de Vignemont 2010; Dijkerman and de \nHaan 2007). The BI is a perceptual conscious representation \nof the body (Cardinali et al. 2012), and is involved in body \nperception, body affect (Cardinali et al. 2012; de Vignemont \n2010; Gallagher 2005), and body concept (Segura-Valverde \net al. 2017). The BS is seen as an unconscious sensorimotor \nrepresentation of the body that is used for action planning \nand execution of movements (Martel et al. 2016; d’ Angelo \net al. 2018). In contrast to the BI which is seen as a sta-\nble representation of body shape and size (Cardinali et al. \n2009a, b), the BS has been defined as a more short-term rep-\nresentation (Cardinali et al. 2012). It flexibly updates with \nevery change in the state of the body, e.g., due to growth and \nbody lengthening accompanying maturation—or as an effect \nof tool-use (Cardinali et al. 2012; Cardinali et al. 2009a, b).\nIndeed, studies on neuroplasticity after tool-use suggest \nthat the BS can be extended to incorporate tools, and other \nobjects we manipulate in our daily life, into the representa-\ntion of our body (Iriki et al. 1996; Romano et al. 2018). \nTool-use dependent alterations of cortical activity patterns \nwere also reported for the left intraparietal sulcus (IPL; \nTomasino et al. 2012), and the posterior parietal cortex \n(PPC; Inoue et al. 2001).\nBehavioural paradigms that have been leveraged to \nexplore how tool-use affects the BS include tactile locali-\nzation, distance estimation and motor control (Cardinali \net al. 2009, 2012). Even 10 min of training with mechanical \ntools for arm extension and body position made participants \nexperience slower arm movement in a reach-to-grasp task, \nwhich could be considered as stretching the arm relative to \nits central representation (Cardinali et al. 2012). Testing the \nperception of tactile distance has previously been employed \nto investigate somatosensory processing and BS plasticity \n(Miller et al. 2014, 2017). While participants usually under-\nestimate the distance between two tactile stimuli presented \nto the skin, previous research revealed some asymmetry \nwith perceived smaller distances along the proximodistal \norientation compared to the mediolateral direction in tactile \ndistance perception tasks with the arm or hand (Calzolari \net al. 2017; Longo et al. 2010). This perceptual asymmetry \nmight be related to anisotropies in the shape and organi-\nsation of tactile receptive fields (RFs) along the hand and \nforearm surface (Canzoneri et al. 2013; Longo and Haggard \n2011). Previous studies suggested, for several body parts, \nthat the perception of tactile distance between two points \non the skin is strongly linked with the BS (Longo 2020; de \nVignemont et al. 2005). Therefore, tactile distance judge-\nment (TDJ) tasks may be valuable paradigms to investigate \nwhether the BS of the hand, the forearm, or other limbs is \naltered after tool-use training (Sun and Tang 2019; Miller \net al. 2014, 2017).\nMiller et al. (2014) used a TDJ task where participants \nhad to judge whether the distance between two stimuli pre-\nsented in different orientations (proximodistal and mediolat-\neral) on the skin were shorter or longer than a reference \npresented on the forehead. In these studies, the perceived \ndistance between two tactile points on the forearm in the \nproximodistal orientation was furthermore significantly \nreduced after tool-use training. Results also revealed that \nrepresentational plasticity was different on the hand and \narm when manipulating the morphological similarity \nbetween the tool and the respective effector (irrespective \nof the function/goal of the tool for grasping and moving the \nobjects). Training to use a hand-like tool and an arm-like \ntool (mechanical grabber) thus appeared to lead to altera-\ntions in the perception of the size of the hand or the arm, \nrespectively (Miller et al. 2014). Jovanov et al. (2015) also \nspotted specificity of BS plasticity to the trained body part. \n1723Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738 \n1 3\nInterestingly, Baccarini et al. (2014) revealed that tool-use \nimagery is enough to induce changes in the representation \nof the arm after participants performed imagery tasks with \neither a tool enlarging their arm length or with their hand \nalone as a control. In addition, according to the work by \nMiller et al. (2014) and Cardinali et al. (2016), the speci-\nficity of BS plasticity corresponding with the shape of the \ntool indicated transferability from hand-shaped tools towards \nreal hand representations, altered grasping actions, and kin-\nematics of the arm. Further, it seems the tool must possess \nfunctional significance to influence the neural representation \nas expected (Sposito et al. 2012).\nTool‑use in virtual and augmented reality\nImmersive virtual reality (VR) can provide rich multisen-\nsory experiences. VR in combination with vibro-tactile \nfeedback provided by so-called ‘cybergloves’ are gain-\ning attention in investigations of tool-use training effects \n(Rubo and Gamer 2019). Previous research suggests that \nexperience in VR affects both ownership and agency \n(Kong et al. 2017). VR has thus been used for stimulating \nbody ownership illusions (BOIs), i.e., the illusory sense \nof ownership over a simulated body, in a very operable \nway (Braun et al. 2018). It was also confirmed that the \nintegration of visuo-tactile stimulation together with one's \nown body movement in a virtual environment induces \nhigh feeling of agency over the virtual limb (Franck et al. \n2001). In the same vein, previous work has consistently \nreported a positive impact of integrating visual and senso-\nrimotor haptic feedback on task performance compared to \nvisual feedback only (Prewett et al. 2012). Finally, Kong \net al. (2017) used two avatars that performed goal-directed \nactions in a VR environment. Depending on their experi-\nmental paradigms, their study revealed that enhanced \nagency over a virtual avatar could emerge in VR. These \nauthors also suggested that sensorimotor experience with \na visible avatar standing in front of the virtual desk is \ncritical for inducing misattribution of agency to an avatar. \nFurthermore, it was indicated that people tend to attribute \nthe avatar hand’s action to themselves after controlling \nthe avatar hand for a brief period. In comparison to VR, \nAR is a more recent technology that has yet to receive the \nsame degree of attention in research on BOIs. AR gener -\nally provides greater feelings of presence and reality of \njudgement for the user than VR. For the purposes of the \npresent study, AR can be used to control an interactive \ntask, while still allowing the user to see their real hand. \nIn comparison with VR training, AR thus enables partici-\npants to reach and grasp the object, and to consider other \ncritical experimental variables during the tool-use training \nsuch as the size and shape of the object. Further, AR can \nmore easily incorporate different aspects of the real physi-\ncal environment than VR, which is based on an entirely \nartificial virtual environment (Lenggenhager et al. 2007; \nJuan et al. 2005).\nThe present work\nIn this study, we transferred the tool-use paradigm intro-\nduced by Miller et al. (2014) into an AR environment. Par -\nticipants had to grasp a virtual object with a virtual gripper \nattached to their own real hand. They were instructed to \ncarefully touch the object with the central part of the grip-\nper’s head but not with either of its protruding sides. This \ntask requires precise control over the gripper and if one \nwould assume some adhesive force between the surfaces, \nthen the object might be ready for being virtually lifted.\nAfter training, the participants answered question -\nnaires about their subjective feelings of ownership and \nagency over the virtual tool. To elucidate the role of visual \nand tactile feedback for the emergence of ownership and \nagency, participants were trained in two different condi-\ntions. In one condition, participants received only visual \nfeedback where they saw the virtual object and virtual \ngripper in AR but also their real hand and the table. In the \nother condition, when (incorrectly) touching the object \nat either side, vibro-tactile feedback was applied to the \nthumb (left) or index finger (right) through a CyberTouch \nII glove, and when (correctly) touching the front of the \nobject with the tool, vibrations were generated at the palm.\nTo test whether the training with the virtual tool led to a \nchange in the arm representation in the BS, we used a TDJ \ntask which required participants to estimate the distance \nbetween two tactile stimuli on the forearm oriented either \nalong the arm axis in proximodistal orientation or orthogo-\nnal to it in mediolateral orientation.\nWe expected the training with the virtual tool to lead \nto a change in the arm representation in the BS, indicated \nby altered perceived distances between two tactile stim-\nuli. Following Miller et al. (2014, 2017), we hypothesised \nthat the perceived distance between two tactile points on \nthe forearm in the proximodistal orientation, but not in \nthe mediolateral orientation, should be reduced after tool-\nuse training, indicating an integration of the virtual tool \ninto the existing BS. We further expected that the amount \nof such changes in the BS should be associated with the \nemergence of ownership and agency over the virtual tool. \nIn fact, these experiences might be comparatively sali -\nent in AR, due to their novelty in comparison with more \nfamiliar physical tools, but might depend on the type of \nfeedback. We therefore predicted that combined visual and \ntactile feedback, as in real world settings, would be more \neffective than visual feedback alone.\n1724 Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738\n1 3\nMethods and procedures\nParticipants\nWe recruited thirty-seven right-handed healthy participants \nat the University of Bremen and Constructor University \n(Formerly known as Jacobs University Bremen). Previous \nstudies reporting effects of tool-use on BS and BI usually \nhad smaller sample sizes between 10 and 20 participants, \nincluding Miller et al. (2014). Because replications usually \nrequire larger sample sizes, we aimed at doubling this sam-\nple size. Although our design is different with respect to the \nAR method used, we therefore assume that our sample size \nshould be sufficient. Participants were compensated with \n10 Euros per hour. They possessed normal or corrected-\nto-normal vision, provided informed consent (participa-\ntion and publication), and were naïve to the experimental \nhypothesis. Data of three participants had to be discarded \ndue to the technical issues and sickness, and thus incom-\npleteness of datasets, yielding a total of 34 participants (15 \nmales, 19 females; M age: 23.64, SD: 7.07). All procedures \nwere approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of \nBremen and were in accordance with the principles of the \nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nStudy design\nParticipants underwent a virtual tool-use training in AR in \ntraining blocks with and without vibro-tactile feedback as \ndescribed in the training section below. The Purdue Peg-\nboard test was used at pre-test to measure unimanual and \nbimanual finger and hand dexterity of participants. BS was \nassessed by the TDJ (cf., Miller et al. 2014, 2017) and a tac-\ntile localization task (TLT). TDJ and TLT were conducted \nbefore training (pre-test), after the training block with the \nfirst feedback condition (mid-test) and after the training \nblock under the other feedback condition (post-test). Both \nownership and agency for the virtual tool were assessed with \nquestionnaires at mid-test and post-test. Electroencepha-\nlography was obtained to record resting-state EEG patterns \nat all three time points and task-related EEG during both \ntraining blocks (cf., Fig. 1) and somatosensory event-related \npotentials were obtained during the TLT. As the focus of this \npaper is on changes of the BS and the question of whether \nthe predicted changes in the BS were correlated with the \nemergence of ownership and agency over the virtual tool, \nwe will report only findings from the TDJ and the ownership \nand agency assessments. Additionally, behavioural data as \nan indication of participant’ performance level during virtual \ntool-use training will be used in our model.\nVirtual tool‑use training in AR\nParticipants sat in front of a white table, wearing a Meta2 \nAR headset (www. metav ision. com), which included ear -\nphones for receiving verbal instructions. A wireless HTC \nVive Tracker 2.0 model KLIM was attached to the back of \ntheir right hand. Next, participants donned a special glove \n(CyberTouch-II, CyberGlove System Inc., 2157 O'Toole \nAve, San Jose, USA; cf., Fig.  2) on their right hand. The \nCyberTouch-II provides fine-grained vibro-tactile feedback \non the inside of each finger and the palm. This glove fur -\nther records the finger movement. The vibrational frequency \ngenerated from the CyberTouch-II ranges from 0–125 Hz \nwith a total of 6 vibrotactile actuators: one on the inside of \neach finger, one on the palm. Vibrational amplitude is 1.2 N \npeak-to-peak at 125 Hz (max). Sensor resolution is 1 degree, \nsensor repeatability is 3 degrees, and sensor data rate is 90 \nrecords/sec.\nThe experimental AR tool-use training task was imple -\nmented in Unity (version 2018.3.8f1) and featured a virtual \ngripper tool consisting of two parallel legs connected to an \nelongated stick, and a blue cube as the target object that the \nparticipant had to enclose with the legs of the gripper tool \n(cf., Fig.  2). In addition to the AR environment generated \nin Unity, participants could see the real surface of the table \nand their hand. The end of the stick was virtually attached \nto the hand.\nThe virtual tool was modelled in Unity in a way that \nwhen overlaid with the physical table in physical space, its \nlength equated to about 30 cm in the real reaching space \nof participants when placed at the starting position in front \nof the participant. Given a forearm length of 25 cm (flat \non the physical table), all cubes in the virtual space could \nbe reached. This estimate is not perfectly precise because \nthe apparent size of the entire scene was influenced by the \nexact distance of the projection screen to the eyes of the \nparticipant, which in turn could be modulated by the tight-\nness of fit for the device. However, these differences were \nFig. 1  Experimental design\nPre-test Training Block 1 Mid-test Training Block 2 Post-test\nTDJ\n120 trials (visual or \nvisual-tactile      \nfeedback)\nTDJ, \nOwnership & \nAgency \nQuestionnaires\n120 trials (visual or \nvisual-tactile \nfeedback) \nTDJ, \nOwnership & \nAgency \nQuestionnaires\n1725Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738 \n1 3\nminimal. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the virtual \nscene (including the tool, the plane and the objects therein) \nwere fixed and thus equally affected by any such (small) \nvariations.\nParticipants performed two blocks of training, one block \nwith visual and vibro-tactile feedback (VT condition) and \none block with only visual feedback (V condition). Each \nblock consisted of 120 trials in two half blocks and the order \nof blocks was randomised among participants.\nDuring training, to start a trial, participants first had to \nplace their hand at a central starting position before them, \nas indicated by a red square. Distance to the red square was \nkept constant. The blue target cube then appeared at different \nlocations in the plane in front of the participants. Partici-\npants had to move their hand, and thus, the virtual gripper, \ntowards the object to grasp it. The task was to enclose the \nvirtual object with the gripper without touching either side \nor moving the gripper into the object. In the condition with \ntactile feedback, touching the object resulted in vibratory \nfeedback to either the thumb (touched left), the index finger \n(touched right), or to the palm (touched at front). A trial \nended when the object was correctly enclosed by the gripper \nwithin 20 s and the participant moved the hand back to the \nstart position for the next trial. Participants were informed \nin advance that an error would occur if they touched (or \nmoved) inside the cube for more than 2 s or if they touched \nthe cube with the tool’s left or right sides for more than 2 s. \nThen the trial would fail and end.\nAfter 10 consecutive trials, there were 10 s of rest. After \neach half block of 60 trials, there was one minute of rest. \nAfter the first block (i.e., in the middle of the experiment), \napproximately 10 min rest were granted. Before each con-\ndition started and during the 1-min break after the first 60 \ntrials, participants were alerted about the type of feedback.\nBefore training, participants performed 20 practice trials \nto learn how to control the virtual tool by moving their right \nhand, forwards, backwards, left, or right.\nThe size of each side of the target cube was 40 × 40  mm2. \nEach training half block of 60 trials started with maximally \nopen gripper jaws (120% of the cube width, i.e., 48  mm3). \nGripper size was then changed adaptively by decreasing the \nwidth of the tool in steps of 0.4 mm in a 3 down / 1 up stair-\ncase procedure. This is to approach a stable 79.4% correct \nperformance level over the practice trials (Leek 2011). Grip-\nper size at this performance level thus is directly related to \nthe practice effect (PE) in respective half blocks. Minimum \ngripper size was 40.4 mm. Each participant performed the \nsame number of trials independently of correct or incorrect \ntrials. The total PE was calculated per block as the relative \ngripper size at the end of the block compared to the starting \ngripper size. PE was calculated by subtracting 48  mm3 as \nthe starting size from the average value of the last 5 trials \ndivided by 48  mm3 [(average value − 48)/48]. Therefore, \nnegative values indicate improved performance.\nMeasures of ownership and agency\nTo measure ownership and agency, we adopted the owner -\nship and agency questionnaire by Zhang and Hommel (2015) \n(cf. Table 1). Each statement was scored on a 7-point Likert \nFig. 2  Experimental setup for \ntool-use training. Top row: \nCyberTouch-II and Wireless \nHTC Vive Tracker. Bottom row: \nScene view\n\n1726 Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738\n1 3\nscale (-3 “strongly disagree” to + 3 “strongly agree”). Four \nmean scores were calculated for statistical analysis by aggre-\ngating 3 questions each: Q1–Q3 were about the experience \nof perceiving the hand as one's own hand, i.e., ownership \n(this variable is abbreviated as BO) and Q7–Q9 were directly \nassociated with the experience of intentional control, i.e., \nagency (BA). \"BO-related\" (Q4–Q6) and “BA-related” \n(Q10–Q12) concerned ownership and agency indirectly \n(Zhang and Hommel 2015). Scores from Q10–Q12 were \nreverse-coded, as the corresponding questions are phrased \nin terms of a loss of control over the tool. According to \nKalckert and Ehrsson (2012, 2014), an average score needed \nto be higher than + 1 to indicate the emergence of ownership \nand agency. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for each of the \nfour subscales, with all scales demonstrating acceptable to \nexcellent internal consistency in the first measurement (BO: \nα = 0.87, BO-related: α = 0.73, BA: α = 0.84, BA-related: \nα = 0.93).\nTactile distance judgement (TDJ) task\nWe applied a TDJ task as pre-test, mid-test and post-test \n(adapted from Miller et al. 2014, 2017). Wooden blocks \nwere prepared with 4 sample pairs of screws, each with dif-\nferent distances between them. The screws had round tips \nwith 9 mm diameter. For TDJ testing parallel to the arm \naxis (“proximodistal” alignment), 3 sample pairs with dis-\ntances of 57.62, 39.94, and 30.03 mm were prepared. For \nTDJ orthogonal to the arm axis (“mediolateral”), because of \nthe anisotropy of RFs, the sample with the largest distance \n(57.62 mm) was replaced by a sample with a smaller dis-\ntance of 22.00 mm. For each trial, one sample was applied \nin pseudorandomized order to the right forearm onto the \nmediolateral or proximodistal orientation (cf., Fig. 3). Each \ntrial lasted approximately 1 s. Each sample was presented 5 \ntimes, resulting in 30 trials in total (15 proximodistal and 15 \nmediolateral; 5 trials each per 3 distances per orientation).\nIn previous studies (Miller 2014, 2017), participants \nwere instructed to report verbally to the experimenter \nwhether they perceived the distance between the two \nTable 1  Statements used in \nthe ownership and agency \nquestionnaire (adapted from \nZhang and Hommel 2015)\nVariable Statement\nBO Q1: I felt as if the virtual tool was an extension of my own hand\nQ2: I felt as if the virtual tool was part of my body\nQ3: I felt as if the virtual tool was my hand\nBO-related Q4: It seems as if I had more than one right hand\nQ5: It felt as if my right hand no longer mattered, as if I only needed to sense the virtual tool\nQ6: I felt as if my real hand developed an enhanced sense of virtual touch\nBA Q7: I felt as if I could cause movements of the virtual tool\nQ8: I felt as if I could control movements of the virtual tool\nQ9: The virtual tool was obeying my will and I could make it move just like I wanted it to\nBA-related Q10: I felt as if the virtual tool was controlling my movements\nQ11: It seemed as if the virtual tool had a will of its own\nQ12: I felt as if the virtual tool was controlling me\nFig. 3  The tactile distance judgement test, with two different orientations (proximodistal, mediolateral) applied to the forearm\n1727Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738 \n1 3\nstimuli on the skin as shorter or longer than a reference \nin the forehead. In this study, we required participants \nto report absolute estimates of the distances. This is in \naccordance with other studies collecting absolute esti-\nmates such as verbal estimates (Longo and Golubiova \n2017; Fiori and Longo 2018), adjustments of a visually \nperceived line (Tamè et al. 2021), or kinaesthetic matching \nof the distance between two fingertips (Keizer et al. 2011; \nKnight et al. 2014).\nParticipants were instructed to indicate the perceived \ndistance between the centres of the screws using a digital \ncalliper (analogue scale). The calliper consisted of two \nsteel legs fixed to a piece of wood attached to the table \nclose to the participant’s left hand. The distance between \nthe legs could be easily adjusted by the participant. Right \nafter each TDJ stimulus, participants were asked to use \ntheir left hand to report the perceived distance by adjust-\ning the distance between the calliper legs, and the distance \nwas noted by the experimenter based on the mm scale \ndisplayed on the calliper monitor (see Fig.  3). Importantly, \nparticipants were prevented from seeing the stimuli pre-\nsented to their forearm by putting an obstacle between \ntheir eyes and the right forearm throughout the TDJ test. \nTherefore, they had no visual information about the real \ndistances, and whether the pairs of stimuli were adminis-\ntered on proximodistal or mediolateral orientation.\nThe judgement error was used as an indicator of per -\nceived arm length and calculated as the difference between \nthe reported distance and the actual distance that was pre-\nsented (error = estimated distance—real distance). Positive \nvalues thus indicated an overestimation and negative val-\nues an underestimation of the distance. Estimation errors \nwere averaged over the five trials per condition (orienta-\ntion and distance) and calculated separately for pre-test, \nmid-test and post-test. A decrease in the distance judgment \nwould indicate that after tool-use training, the virtual tool \nwas appended to the sensorimotor representation of the \narm within the extent of the existing BS, i.e., the soma-\ntotopic cortical representation (cf., Fig.  11). As a conse-\nquence, the arm would become perceptually shorter, and \ndifferent locations on the proximodistal orientation of the \nforearm would be perceived as closer together.\nData analysis and statistics\nThe dataset that was generated and analysed during the \ncurrent study will be made available on publication in an \nOpen Science Framework repository on OSF.io. Inferential \nstatistics were performed with R (R Core Team 2021) and \nthe Jamovi software environment version 2.2.5.6.2 (The \nJamovi project 2021). All relevant R packages (v4.1.1; \nRStudio v1.4.1717) and related references are listed in the \nsupplement. If not stated differently, p  < 0.05 were con-\nsidered as significant, and p values  < 0.10 as marginally \nsignificant throughout the report.\nResults\nBaseline asymmetry in TDJ error\nFirst, we examined baseline differences in Estimation \nErrors for different Orientations and Distances. Figure  4 \ndisplays TDJ Estimation Errors at baseline in mm for \ndifferent Distances and Orientations. For proximodistal, \nbut not mediolateral Orientations, the Estimation Error \ndecreased with increasing distance.\nTo confirm hypothesised baseline asymmetries of \ndistance judgement errors in the TDJ, we fitted a gen-\neral linear model (GLM) to predict Estimation Error at \nbaseline with Orientation (proximodistal or mediolateral) \nFig. 4  TDJ Estimation Errors in mm at baseline dependent on stimu-\nlus Distance and Orientation.

The model's explanatory power \nis weak but significant (R 2 = 0.094, adj. R2 = 0.087, \nF(3,404) = 13.96, p < 0.001; cf. Table  2). The model's \nintercept is at 29.3 (95% CI [23.4, 35.2]), indicating over -\nestimation of tactile distance. Within this model, effects \nof Orientation (t (404) = 3.95, p < 0.001) and Distance \n(t(404) = − 3.08, p = 0.002), as well as the interaction of \nOrientation and Distance was significant (t (404) = − 3.93, \np =  < 0.001). Only for the proximodistal orientation, the \nestimation error decreased with increasing distance.\nPractice effect and role of visual and visuo‑tactile \nfeedback\nThe final performance level as approached by the stair -\ncase procedure during training blocks was lower for the \nVT Feedback compared to the V Feedback condition (cf., \nFig. 5). This indicates that VT Feedback was more effec-\ntive. To quantify and statistically test the effect of Feed-\nback condition on PE, GLM analysis with PE as a depend-\nent variable and Feedback condition (VT or V) and Block \nnumber (first or second training block) as factors were \nconducted. The model’s explanatory power is significant \n(R2 = 0.164, adj. R2 = 0.117, F(3, 53) = 3.464, p = 0.022; \ncf., Table  3). The model’s intercept was at − 0.443 (95% \nCI [−  0.517, −  0.369] indicating a reduction in gripper \nsize on average. The effect of Feedback was significant \n(F(1, 53) = 6.82, p = 0.01), but no significant effect of \nBlock nor an interaction effect of Block x Feedback was \nrevealed for PE as a dependent variable.\nA post hoc t-test revealed that PE was significantly \nlower (more negative, indicating more reduction in \ngripper size) for the VT than for the V Feedback condi-\ntion (t (53) =  − 2.611; p = 0.01; (cf., Fig.  5).\nEffects of tool‑use training on TDJ error\nWe followed a two-step procedure to test our assumption that \ntraining would affect TDJ error in the proximodistal Orienta-\ntion. We first analysed the effects of distance and baseline \nerror on post-test error. The Residuals of this analysis repre-\nsent the variance in error after training that is not explained \nby baseline and distance and was then used for analysing the \nOrientation effect on TDJ error after training. This allowed \nus to evaluate Orientation effects on Estimation Errors after \ntraining regardless of the different Distances used for both \nOrientations. Without any training effect, Residuals should \nbe around zero. Negative residuals would indicate reduced \nEstimation Errors.\nAs illustrated in Fig.  6, there was a tendency that aver -\nage Residuals per individual for proximodistal Orientation \nwere lower than those for mediolateral Orientation. As \nthe assumption of normality was violated (Shapiro–Wilk \nW = 0.93, p = 0.028), we performed a one-sided one-sample \nFig. 5  A Gripper size during training Blocks with VT versus V \nFeedback conditions.

There-\nfore, one might conclude that perceived arm length (proxi-\nmodistal Orientation) but not arm width (mediolateral Ori-\nentation) was reduced (cf., Fig. 7).\nHowever, Orientation effects on the residuals were not \nvery robust and disappeared when taking Feedback and Test \n(mid-test, post-test) into account. We fitted a linear model \nto predict the Residual Estimation Error with Orientation, \nTest and Feedback. The model’s explanatory power is very \nweak and not significant (R 2 = 0.01, adj. R2 = − 0.004, F(7, \n407) = 0.77, p = 0.607; cf., Table 4). The model’s intercept \nis at − 0.56 (95% CI [− 2.17, 1.04]). Within this model, no \nsignificant main or interaction effects could be revealed.\nBody ownership and body agency after virtual \ntool‑use\nDescriptive analysis of ownership and agency revealed val-\nues of 0.0 ± 0.1 and − 0.3 ± 0.1 for BO and BO-related, and \n1.7 ± 0.1 and 1.8 ± 0.1 for BA and BA-related, respectively \n(means and SE). Thus, only mean values for BA and BA-\nrelated, but not BO and BO-related, were above 1 and thus \nabove the threshold suggested by Kalckert and Ehrsson \n(2012, 2014). Figure  8 illustrates these findings separated \nby Feedback condition and Test.\nTo analyse whether emergence of ownership and agency \nwas dependent on Feedback, Test, BS plasticity or PE, \nwe performed a three-step linear regression separately for \nownership and agency ratings. In the first step, we analysed \nwhether ratings were predicted by Feedback and Test or the \ninteraction of Feedback and Test (model 1). In the second \nstep we added PE (model 2), and in the third step we added \nTDJ Estimation Error to the regression model (model 3; cf. \nTable 5).\nFor BO, model 1 was not significant (R 2 = 0.05, adj. \nR2 = 0.002; F(3, 53) = 1.05, p = 0.378; cf.

Adding Residual Estimation Error (model \n3) again slightly improved the initial model (p  = 0.073; \ncf., Table  6), and this model was also marginally signifi-\ncant (R 2 = 0.16, adj. R2 = 0.08; F(5, 51) = 2.05, p = 0.087; \nTable 5). Further, it revealed a marginally significant pre-\ndiction effect of PE (beta = − 2.153, SE = 1.132; p = 0.063; \nTable  7) and a marginally significant prediction effect \nof Residual Estimation Error for BO (beta = − 0.03, \nSE = 0.016; p = 0.073; cf., Table 7). BO ratings increased \nwith increasing performance level (decreasing PE) and \ndecreasing Estimation Error, i.e., more BS plasticity (cf., \nFig. 10). No effects of Test or Feedback or their interaction \ncould be revealed.\nFor BO-related, model 1 was not significant (R2 = 0.05, adj. \nR2 = 0.0007; F(3, 53) = 1.01, p = 0.394).

Adding Residual \nEstimation Error in model 3 significantly improved the model \n(p = 0.022; cf., Table 6) and the model became marginally sig-\nnificant (R2 = 0.18, adj. R2 = 0.11; F(5, 51) = 2.36, p = 0.052; \ncf., Table  5). Model 3 revealed a significant prediction of \nBO-related by PE (beta = − 1.502, SE = 0.866; p = 0.089; \ncf., Table 7) and Residual Estimation Error (beta = − 0.288, \nSE = 0.012, p = 0.022; cf. Table 7). As for BO, BO-related rat-\nings increased with decreasing Estimation Error, i.e., more BS \nplasticity (cf., Fig. 9) but also with increased performance level \n(more negative PE; cf., Fig. 10). Again, no effects of Test or \nFeedback or their interaction could be revealed.\nFor BA, model 1 was not significant (R 2 = 0.006, adj. \nR2 = − 0.05; F(3, 53) = 0.12, p = 0.948: cf., Table 5). Adding PE \nin model 2 (beta = − 1.354, SE = 0.966, p = 0.167; cf., Tables 6 \nand 7) did not improve the model significantly (R2 = 0.04, adj. \nR2 = − 0.03; F(4, 52) = 0.58, p = 0.676; Tables 5). Further \nadding Residual Estimation Error in model 3 (beta = − 0.010, \nSE = 0.013, p = 0.436; cf., Tables 6 and 7) also did not improve \nthe initial model (R2 = 0.05, adj. R2 = − 0.04; F(5, 51) = 0.58, \np = 0.710; cf., Table 5). Thus, neither PE nor BS plasticity pre-\ndicted agency ratings (cf., Figs. 9 and 10). Also, neither effects \nof Test nor Feedback or their interaction could be revealed.\nFor BA-related, model 1 was not significant ( R2 = 0.06, \nadj.

Thus, neither PE nor BS plasticity predicted agency-\nrelated ratings (cf., Fig.  9). Again, neither effect of Test or \nFeedback or their interaction could be revealed.\nFig. 8  Ratings of BO, BO-\nrelated, BA, and BA-related \nsubscales depending on \nFeedback condition and Test. \nBoxes represent medians and \ninterquartile ranges.

Such asymmetries, \nwith distances being perceived as smaller for proximodis-\ntal than for mediolateral orientations, could be suggested \nbased on the oval shape of RFs, which are larger along \nthe proximodistal compared to the mediolateral body axis \n(Longo 2020; Mainka et al. 2021). On the contrary to these \nfindings, in the current study, estimation errors became \nsmaller in the proximodistal orientation but only for larger \ndistances that were not measured for the mediolateral ori-\nentation. However, this result must be taken with care \nbecause the explanatory power of the model was weak, \nand the results might be biased by the use of different dis-\ntances in the proximodistal and mediolateral orientations.\nVirtual tool-use training resulted in smaller residual \nestimation errors, i.e., reduced overestimation of dis-\ntances in the proximodistal orientation, which is in line \nwith previous studies in non-virtual settings (e.g., Iriki \net al. 1996, 2011; Cardinali et al. 2009a, b; Sposito et al. \n2012; Miller et al. 2014, 2017). While it was previously \nsuggested that the incorporation of the tool into the exist-\ning BS leads to an increase of the perceived arm length \n(for review, e.g., Sposito et al. 2012), and consequently \nto a shift of the perceived boundary of reachable space \n(Maravita and Iriki 2004), our results are consistent with \nthe notion that after tool-use training, the virtual tool was \nappended to the sensorimotor representation of the arm \nwithin the extent of the existing BS, i.e. the somatotopic \ncortical representation (cf., Fig.  11). Thus, in our study \nthe arm became perceptually shorter, and different loca-\ntions on the proximodistal orientation of the forearm were \nperceived as closer together. Given that there is a close \nassociation between BI and BS, i.e., the conscious BI will \ndepend on the information provided by the unconscious \nBS, a consciously perceived reduction of the arm length \n(= BI) could be caused by an unconscious alteration of \nthe somatotopic body map in the somatosensory cortex \nTable 5  Model fit parameters of the three linear regression models for Ownership and Agency variables\n***p < .001, **p < .01, *p < .05,  + p < .10\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3\nR R2 Adjusted\nR2\nF RMSE p R R2 Adjusted R2 F RMSE p R R2 Adjusted R2 F RMSE p\nBO 0.23 0.05 0.002 1.05 1.67 .379 0.33 0.11 0.04 1.64 1.62 .177 0.41 0.16 0.08 2.05 1.57 .087+\nBO-related 0.23 0.05 0.0007 1.01 1.30 .394 0.31 0.09 0.03 1.43 1.26 .23 0.43 0.18 0.11 2.36 1.20 .052+\nBA 0.08 0.006 − 0.05 0.12 1.38 .948 0.21 0.04 − 0.03 0.58 1.35 .676 0.23 0.05 − 0.04 0.58 1.34 .710\nBA-related 0.24 0.06 0.004 1.08 1.32 .362 0.24 0.06 − 0.014 0.81 1.32 .528 0.24 0.06 − 0.03 0.63 1.32 .675\n1732 Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738\n1 3\n(= BS), where a reduced representation of the arm is seen \ndue to incorporation of the tool within the given space \nof the map. Under different experimental conditions, it \nmight be that participants project their own hand/arm \nto the external position of the (virtual) tool like in body \nownership illusions. Here, the BS might be unchanged but \ndifferently integrated with the coordinates of the external \nspace, leading to perceived enlargement of the own body \nin the BI. This could explain contradictory findings in pre-\nvious studies. Martel et al. (2021, 2019) reported a similar \nreduction of consciously estimated arm length after tool \nuse under vision, but not when blindfolded. One might \nspeculate that a shift of visual spatial attentional focus to \nthe (end of) the tool facilitates BS plasticity and perceived \nshrinkage of the own arm (cf., Rossetti et al. 2015).\nInterestingly, Canzoneri et al. (2013) observed that after \ntool-use training, subjects not only perceived distances \nbetween two stimuli as smaller in the proximodistal but \nalso as larger in the mediolateral direction in a tactile dis-\ntance perception task administered on their forearm. We \nspeculate that this might be an effect of the audio-tactile \ninteraction task employed by Canzoneri et al. (2013), in \nwhich participants were blindfolded and exposed to audi-\ntory stimulation (pink noise) which potentially restricted \ntheir peripersonal space and narrowed their BI. In contrast, \nin our own and other previous work (e.g., Miller et al. \n2014, 2017), the visual domain is likely to have made a \nstrong contribution to learning during the tool-use train-\ning. Here, future experiments with the aim to leverage AR \nand audio-tactile stimulation could help resolve and better \nunderstand this apparent discrepancy.\nAdditionally, we further examined whether there was \na practice effect during the training and if this effect was \ndependent on the type of feedback (visuo-tactile or visual \nonly) given during each block. As expected, participants \nlearned virtual tool-use better during training with visuo-\ntactile feedback, resulting in smaller gripper size at the \nend of the practice block. Also, a steeper learning slope \nwas observed during this type of feedback compared with \nvision-only feedback. This highlights the importance of \nmultisensory integration in tool-use learning. However, \nsince immersive AR provides an environment in which \ndifferent sensory information channels can be isolated, we \nsuggest future studies to examine in detail the contribution \nof each sensory modality to the learning effect.\nChanges in ownership but not agency relate \nto altered body schema and  practice effect\nParticipants developed a modified sense of agency during \ntraining, but no association with PE or BS plasticity was \nrevealed. However, ratings were very high in all conditions \nand a ceiling effect might have masked potential effects. \nAlthough, on average, participants did not develop a sense of \nbody ownership over the tool, regression analyses indicated \nthat on individual level there were negative associations \nbetween estimation error and ownership ratings. Thus, even \nwith the average effect of tool-use training on the BS being \nnot very robust, the more the overestimation in the TDJ as \na sensitive measure of representational plasticity along the \nproximodistal orientation was reduced, the higher the owner-\nship ratings became. This suggests that plastic reorganisation \nof the sensorimotor representation, i.e., the BS, was indeed \nassociated with an increase in the subjective experience of \nthe tool being a part of one's body. Thus, our findings sug-\ngest that the emergence of a sense of body ownership may \nstrongly relate to changes in the sensorimotor BS, which \nthen are reflected in an altered BI. Additionally, ownership \nratings were higher with larger practice effects.\nCardinali et al. (2021) and Rossetti et al. (2015) used skin \nconduction measurements to investigate embodiment, i.e., \nchanges in body ownership over the used tool. In the study \nby Cardinali et al. (2021), body ownership over a mechanical \ngrabber (arm-shaped tool) was expressed in an altered skin \nconductance response to a threatening stimulus approaching \nthe tool. This was interpreted as that the tool was perceived \nas part of the own body. Rossetti et al. (2015) found that \ntool-use training expanded the space around the body in \nwhich an approaching stimulus was perceived as a thread \nas indicated by induced changes in skin conductance. These \nfindings were interpreted as an enlargement of the periper -\nsonal space through the incorporated tool. Recently, Miller \net al. (2014, 2017), reported that illusory embodiment is \ndependent on the shape of the tool. While an arm-shaped \ntool modulated tactile perception on the arm but not the \nhand, a hand-like tool altered perception on the hand but not \nthe arm. Extending these findings, Cardinali et al. (2021) \nTable 6  Model comparison \nof the three linear regression \nmodels for Ownership and \nAgency variables\n***p < .001, **p < .01, *p < .05,  + p < .10\nComparison BO BO-related BA BA-related\nΔR2 F P ΔR2 F P ΔR2 F P ΔR2 F P\nModel 1 vs. 2 0.05 3.30 .075+ 0.04 2.58 .114 0.03 1.96 0.167 2.87 0.01 .901\nModel 2 vs. 3 0.05 3.35 .073+ 0.08 5.60 .022* 0.01 0.61 0.436 1.13 0.006 .938\n1733Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738 \n1 3\nreported that not only visual similarity but also similar -\nity in potential actions performed with the tool or the own \nhand is an important factor facilitating the illusory embodi-\nment. Tool-use in virtual or augmented realities might be \nan ideal solution to experimentally manipulate function and \nmorphology of the tool to investigate their effects on tool \nembodiment and associated alterations in BS and BI, as \nthese multilayer phenomena cannot be captured in a single \ntask (Cardinali et al. 2021).\nManipulating feedback conditions in VR and AR\nWe found steeper learning curves and stronger PE for \ntraining with visuo-tactile feedback as compared to visual \nfeedback alone. This is in line with the notion that tactile \nfeedback plays an important role in sensorimotor control \nof grasping and manipulation of objects (D’ Alonzo et al. \n2015). D’ Angelo et al. (2018) trained participants to con -\ntrol a virtual hand in VR to grasp an object and examined \nthe sensorimotor representation of forearm length using a \nforearm bisection task and a reaching distance task. Their \nresults suggested that synchronous movements of real and \nvirtual hands may lead to changes in the forearm BS, which \nis again consistent with the argument that multisensory, i.e., \nvisual and proprioceptive, feedback may play a critical role \nin mediating this effect. When the hand interacts with the \nphysical object in daily life, sensorimotor information of \nmechanical contact is necessary to enable planning and con-\ntrolling of the object manipulation (Johansson and Flanagan, \n2009) and vision-only input is not sufficient for “correction \nand control of grasping and manipulation” (Stephens-Fripp \net al. 2018).\nContrary to our expectation, the type of feedback did \nnot play a role in the association between altered BS and \nemergence of ownership and agency. Therefore, our results \nare not consistent with previous studies which reported that \ntouch, nociception, proprioception, and tactile feedback \nwere essential for embodiment (Beckerle et al. 2018; Azañón \net al. 2016), and that a high degree of BR malleability dur -\ning action performance was linked to both tactile and visual \nfeedback. One might speculate that when touching a physical \nobject in real life we do not receive a vibration and the sense \nof touch is different. Thus, it might be that synchrony is not \nas precise as with simple touch.\nOwnership for a virtual hand/tool could be modulated \nand enhanced through sensory feedback and multisensory \nintegration (Beckerle et al. 2018 ), wherein an interaction \nof synchronous visuo-tactile feedback had been argued to \nlead to an enhanced sense of body ownership (Richard et al. \n2021). Interestingly, in the case of conflicting visual and \ntactile information, the visual information seemed to be a \nprimary factor in the embodiment process. We assume that, \nalthough BS plasticity also was independent of feedback \nTable 7  Linear regression for Ownership and Agency variables as dependent variables, Feedback and Test as factors and Residual Estimation Error and Practice Effect as covariates\nBeta Coefficients and Standard errors (in parenthesis) are reported. ***p < .001, **p < .01, *p < .05, +p < .10\nIndependent variables BO BO-related BA BA-related\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 1 Model 2 Model 3\nIntercept 0.940\n(0.775)\n0.200\n(0.861)\n0.140\n(0.843)\n− 1.120\n(0.601)\n− 1.631**\n(0.672)\n− 1.69**\n(0.644)\n1.340*\n(0.638)\n0.863\n(0.718)\n0.885\n(0.721)\n2.540***\n(0.610)\n2.498***\n(0.699)\n2.496***\n(0.706)\nFeedback − 1.015\n(0.852)\n− 1.328\n(0.852)\n− 1.319\n(0.833)\n1.058\n(0.661)\n0.841\n(0.665)\n0.850\n(0.637)\n0.364\n(0.702)\n0.163\n(0.710)\n0.160\n(0.712)\n− 0.523\n(0.671)\n− 0.541\n(0.692)\n− 0.540\n(0.698)\nTest − 1.065\n(0.852)\n− 1.045\n(0.834)\n− 1.015\n(0.815)\n0.65\n(0.661)\n0.633\n(0.651)\n0.692\n(0.624)\n0.314\n(0.702)\n0.327\n(0.696)\n0.316\n(0.698)\n− 0.523\n(0.671)\n− 0.522\n(0.677)\n− 0.521\n(0.684)\nFeedback x Test 2.240*\n(1.265)\n2.060\n(1.243)\n2.017\n(1.215)\n− 1.162\n(0.981)\n− 1.287\n(0.970)\n− 1.327\n(0.930)\n− 0.593\n(1.043)\n− 0.710\n(1.037)\n− 0.694\n(1.040)\n− 0.568\n(0.997)\n− 0.579\n(1.009)\n− 0.579\n(1.019)\nPE − 2.102\n(1.158)\n− 2.153+\n(1.132)\n− 1.451\n(0.904)\n− 1.502+\n(0.866)\n− 1.354\n(0.966)\n− 1.335\n(0.969)\n− 0.118\n(0.940)\n− 0.119\n(0.949)\nResidual Estimation Error − 0.03+\n(0.016)\n− 0.288**\n(0.012)\n0.0107\n(0.013)\n− 0.001\n(0.013)\n1734 Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1721–1738\n1 3\nFig. 9  Associations between Residual Estimation Error for proximodistal Orientations in mm and Ownership and Agency ratings.

Overall, our findings suggest that virtual tools can \nbe incorporated into the existing BS of the forearm, while \nshowcasing how future work may further disambiguate the \ncontributions of tactile and visual feedback. At present, \nit appears that the visual domain may have a leading role \nin this process. However, our present work is still limited \nbecause the visual modality was always available and could \nnot be controlled in any way. This might be addressed in \nfuture work that presents tactile feedback with and without \nvisual feedback.\nIn addition, our self-report results suggest that the AR \ntool may be perceived as sufficiently similar to a physical \ntool that moves directly with own’s hand. Our results are \nfurther consistent with the notion that the tool-use dependent \nrepresentational plasticity of a body part and the specificity \ncorresponds with the shape of the tool (Miller et al. 2014). In \nother words, our findings indicated transferability of the BS \nrepresentational plasticity induced by an arm-shaped virtual \ntool towards real arm representations.\nFinally, the present work suggests that vibro-tactile and \nvisual feedback may jointly increase tool embodiment in \nAR, although further studies with similar paradigms are \nneeded. We believe that this may have implications for \nfurther neurobehavioral work in experimental psychology, \nas well as with respect to designing more immersive and \nrealistic tool-use experiences in other AR application con-\ntexts. For example, further work on this intersection could \ncontribute to our understanding of challenging real-world \nuse cases, such as requirements for BS malleability in the \ncontext of virtually operating theatres (see, e.g., Zaman et al. \n2019). Together, our findings thus substantially extend previ-\nous studies by demonstrating how even virtual tools become \nincorporated into the BS, while adding to our understand-\ning of the respective roles of visual and haptic feedback in \nvirtual tool-use training in general.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00221- 023- 06644-3.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Mohamed Abou Ghazala for \nhis support in the development of virtual tool-use application in aug-\nmented reality as part of his BSc. thesis at Cognitive System Lab, \nUniversity of Bremen.\nAuthors contribution AJN: Conceptualization, methodology, investi-\ngation, data collection, data curation, original draft preparation, vali-\ndation, formal analyses, data visualisation, editing and final revision; \nDK: conceptualization and design of the study, reviewing and editing, \nresources, funding acquisition, project administration; FP: conceptual-\nization and design of the study, validation, resources, funding acquisi-\ntion, project administration; BG: conceptualization and design of the \nstudy, supervision, validation, formal analyses, reviewing and editing, \nresources, funding, project administration, final revision.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt \nDEAL.
