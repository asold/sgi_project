I NTRODUCTION\nConventional power transformers (CPTs), which provide\nisolation and voltage transformation, are an integral part of the\nelectrical power distribution system from more than 100 years\nas these are cheap, reliable, and have high efﬁciency. However,\nincrease in renewable energy sources (RES), electrical vehicles\n(EVs), energy storage elements, etc., need new services to the\nelectric grid [1].\nIn the literature, smart transformer (ST) has been proposed\nas an alternate to the CPT in distribution grid [2]–[5]. The most\nﬂexible structure of the ST is made up of three-stage power\nconverters. First stage is MV ac-dc rectiﬁer, the second stage\nis MV to LV dc- dc isolation converter, and the third stage is\nLV dc-ac converter connected to the LV ac distribution grid. In\naddition to providing advantages like voltage transformation\nand isolation between the MV and LV sides similar to CPTs,\nthe ST can provide several additional features like balanced si-\nnusoidal voltage in LV distribution system, balanced sinusoidal\nunity power factor current in the MV grid side, no effect of\nMV side disturbances like sag, swell, transients etc., on the\nThe authors are with the Chair of Power Electronics, Christian-Albrechts-\nUniversity of Kiel, Kaiserstrasse 2 24143 Kiel, Germany (e-mail: cku@tf.uni-\nkiel.de; ml@tf.uni-kiel.de).\nvs\nRs Ls\nDistribution Loads/\nGeneration\nFeeder II\nFeeder I\nDistribution \nTransformer\nDistribution \nTransformer\nDistribution Loads/\nGeneration\nFig. 1.

Moreover,\nbeing more expansive than CPTs, the ST must also have\ncapability to provide ancillary services to the medium voltage\npower distribution system for making ST applications more\nattractive.

Single line diagram of proposed ST based distribution system.\nFig. 1 shows an equivalent single line diagram of a con-\nventional power distribution system consisting of two radial\nfeeders in a city center. Both the feeders, with distributed loads\nand/or generation, has separate CPT for providing isolation\nand reducing the voltage level appropriate for the low voltage\ndistribution system. Due to the nature of the load/generation,\nthe system will have issues like unbalanced distorted grid\ncurrents, unbalanced distorted grid voltages, poor power factor,\nvoltage sag, voltage swell, etc. In a future distribution grid\nshown in Fig. 2, the CPT in one feeder is replaced by the\nST whereas another feeder uses the CPT. With the ST, the\nperformance of the load in feeder I signiﬁcantly improves as it\nprovides advantages like balanced sinusoidal rectiﬁer currents,\nbalanced load voltages, no effect of grid side disturbances on\nloads, etc. However, the feeder II having no compensating\ndevice suffers from all aforementioned issues resulting in\ndeterioration of load performance and violation of the grid\ncodes.\nBy considering above issues, the paper aims to bring out the\noperational features of the ST in a two feeder system as shown\nin Fig. 2 to improve the performance of medium voltage power\ndistribution system. Simulation results are presented to show\nthe effectiveness of ST in providing load compensation in the\nmedium voltage power distribution system.\nII. D ESCRIPTION OF THE CONSIDERED ST BASED POWER\nDISTRIBUTION SYSTEM\nA detailed description of the ST based considered power\ndistribution system is shown in Fig. 3. For simplicity, the\nsystem consisting of two radial feeder with different types\nof loads are chosen. However, the scheme can be extended\nto the multiple feeder system where ST is connected to only\none feeder. In addition to providing continuous and reliable\noperation to feeder I, the ST also improves the performance\nof the loads connected at the feeder II. The ST supplies for\nthe unbalance and harmonics of the feeder II and makes total\ngrid current balanced and sinusoidal. In the feeder I, the ST is\nused to supply the load power and improve the performance of\nthe load connected in this feeder. In this work, it is considered\nthat the power rating of the ST is 1 MW. However, for most\nof the time of its operation, the ST operates much below its\nrated capacity. Also, utilization of the ST is further reduced\nas the renewable energy sources may be connected at the LV\ndc link which supplies for some part of the load. Hence,\nit is assumed that the sufﬁcient ST power rating is left for\nthe improvement of the load connected to the other feeder\ncontinuing with the CPT. The loads connected to the feeder\nII are unbalanced nonlinear loads which draw unbalanced and\nhighly reactive currents. The grid current, feeder I current,\nfeeder II current, and PCC voltage are denoted by ig, if , il\nand vt, respectively. Commonly used three level neutral point\nclamped voltage source inverter is used to realize the MV\nrectiﬁer circuit in this work. The voltages Vdc1 = Vdc2 = Vdc\nare maintained at the both the capacitors of the rectiﬁer for\nproper operation of ST.\nIII. D EVELOPMENT OF REFERENCE QUANTITIES IN\nDIFFERENT OPERATING CONDITIONS\nFig. 4 shows a control block diagram for the generation of\nreference current of the MV rectiﬁer. From the control block,\nit can be seen that the rectiﬁer of the ST will supply different\ncurrents into the MV grid depending upon the operating\nconditions. It consists of the following parts.\nA. Reference Current for the Feeder I where ST is Connected\nLet the ST reference currents only for the continuous\noperation of the loads connected to the feeder I be i∗\nfd1a, i∗\nfd1b,\nand i∗\nfd1c in phases a, b, and c, respectively. These currents\nare treated as the primary reference currents of the rectiﬁer in\nthis work. From the block diagram shown in Fig. 4, it can be\nseen that these currents are drawn from the MV grid to (a)\nsupply the loads connected to the LV side of feeder I and (b)\nmaintain the dc link voltage at a constant value.\nThe rectiﬁer currents must be in phase with the respective\nphase PCC voltages. Based on the instantaneous symmetrical\ncomponent theory, the reference currents in this case are\ncomputed as follows [15]:\ni∗\nfd1a = v+\nta1\n∆+\n1\n(Pload1 + Ploss)\ni∗\nfd1b = v+\ntb1\n∆+\n1\n(Pload1 + Ploss)\ni∗\nfd1c = v+\ntc1\n∆+\n1\n(Pload1 + Ploss)\n(1)\nwhere ∆+\n1 = (v+\nta1)2 + (v+\ntb1)2 + (v+\ntc1)2. The terms v+\nta1, v+\ntb1,\nand v+\ntc1 are fundamental positive sequence voltages in three\nphases. The powers Pload1 and Ploss are average load power\ndemand of feeder I and power losses in the MV rectiﬁer circuit,\nrespectively. The power Pload1 can be obtained through a local\ncommunication between the MV and LV sides. The power loss\nPloss is computed using a proportional integral (PI) controller\nas follows:\nPloss = Kp evdc + Ki\n∫\nevdc dt (2)\nwhere Kp, Ki, and evdc = 2 Vdcref - (vdc1 + vdc2) are\nproportional gain, integral gain, and voltage error of the PI\ncontroller, respectively. The term Ploss helps in maintaining\nthe MV dc link voltage at a reference voltage.\nvtabc\nPload2\nCompute\n reference \ncurrents \nneeded for \nsatisfactory \noperation of \nfeeder II\nMoving \naverage \nfilterilabc\nFundamental \npositive sequence \nextraction\nifd1a*\nPI \ncontroller\n2Vdcref\nvdc1+vdc2\nPloss\nPload1\nFundamental \npositive sequence \ncomponents  \nextraction\nvtabc\nCompute\n reference \ncurrents \nneeded for \nsatisfactory \noperation of \nfeeder I\nVtabc1+\nφt1+\nPLL\nθ Three \nphase \nunit sin\nVtabc1+\nφt1+\nifd1b*\nifd1c*\nifd2a*\nifd2b*\nifd2c*\n*ifa\nifb\nifc\n*\n*\nThree level \nhysteresis \ncontrol of \nrectifier\nIGBT \nswitching \npulses\nifc\nifb\nifa\nFig. 4. Reference current generation scheme for the proposed ST operation in a distribution system.\nB. Reference Currents for Improving the Performance of\nLoads Connected to Feeder II\nThe ST should supply unbalance, reactive, and harmonic\ncomponent of the loads connected to the feeder II for achieving\nproper load compensation in MV power system. Alternately,\nthe ST is controlled in such a way that the MV grid currents\nare balanced, sinusoidal, and in phase with the respective PCC\nvoltages. Moreover, the MV grid supply only average load\npower requirements of the feeders I and II. Let the reference\ncurrents that need to be supplied by the rectiﬁer to achieve\nthese advantages be i∗\nfd2a, i∗\nfd2b, and i∗\nfd2c for phases a,\nb, and c, respectively. Based on instantaneous symmetrical\ncomponent theory, these currents are given as follows:\ni∗\nfd2a = ila − v+\nta1\n∆+\n1\n(Pload2)\ni∗\nfd2b = ilb − v+\ntb1\n∆+\n1\n(Pload2)\ni∗\nfd2c = ilc − v+\ntc1\n∆+\n1\n(Pload2)\n(3)\nwhere Pload2 represents the average load power requirements\nin the feeder II. This power is calculated using a moving\naverage ﬁlter for better performance during transients and can\nhave a window width of half cycle or full cycle depending\nupon odd or odd and even harmonics, respectively present in\nthe load currents. This is computed as follows:\nPload2 = 1\nT\n∫ t1\nt1−T\n(vtaila + vtbilb + vtcilc) dt. (4)\nwhere t1 and T are any time instant and system time period,\nrespectively.\nC. Total Reference Current of the MV Rectiﬁer\nFor most of the time of the operation, the power system\noperates at the much lower than its rated power. In that case,\nthe ST will supply for the unbalance, reactive, and harmonic\nloads of feeder II, in addition to supplying for loads connected\nto feeder I. However, if the rated loads are connected at\nthe LV side of ST, the ST will not be able to provide load\ncompensation. Therefore, load compensation control scheme\nwill be deactivated during this scenario. Hence, in general, the\ntotal reference currents of the MV rectiﬁer ( i∗\nfa , i∗\nfb , and i∗\nfc )\nare given as\ni∗\nfa = −k1i∗\nfd1a + k2i∗\nfd2a\ni∗\nfb = −k1i∗\nfd1b + k2i∗\nfd2b\ni∗\nfc = −k1i∗\nfd1c + k2i∗\nfd2c\n(5)\nIn the above equation, the terms k1 and k2 are constants having\na value of either 1 or 0. The value 1 is selected when the\nparticular control action is activated, otherwise it will be set\nto 0. Therefore, depending upon the operating conditions of the\npower distribution system, the reference currents are selected.\nAim of this paper is to bring out the possible services the ST\ncan provide to the multiple feeder MV distribution power sys-\ntem. Therefore, a simple three level hysteresis current control\nscheme is used to control the currents through the rectiﬁer. In\nthis work, we have used a three phase, three level, neutral point\nclamped voltage source inverter. The generation of reference\ncurrents i∗\nfabc is shown in Fig. 4. The computed reference\ncurrents are compared with the actual rectiﬁer currents ifabc .\nThe three level hysteresis current control scheme implemented\nfor the switching pulses generation ensures that there is no\nsuccessive between +1 to -1 states, as this will increase the\nswitching frequency [16].\nTABLE I\nSIMULATION PARAMETERS\nSystem quantities Values\nSource rms voltage 11 kV line-line, 50 Hz\nSource impedance Zs = 0.1 + j 3.14 Ω\nFeeder I loads Average power of 500 kW\nFeeder II linear loads Sla = 100 + j100 kV A,\nSlb = 300 + j200 kV A\nSlc = 0 + j200 kV A\nFeeder II nonlinear loads Diode bridge rectiﬁer loads\nMV rectiﬁer parameters Vdc = 15 kV , Lf = 100 mH,\nCdc = 4000 µF,\nRf = 1 Ω\nCurrent band ± 5 V\nPI controller gains Kp = 7 , Ki = 0.3\nIV. S IMULATION RESULTS\nThis section presents the simulation results obtained after\nimplementing appropriate control scheme in MV rectiﬁer of\nthe ST connected in the two feeder city center. The simulations\nare carried out on the PSCAD 4.5 software. The parameters of\nthe considered system are given in Table I. The source voltage\nis taken as 11 kV rms line-line, 50 Hz. The feeder I draws a\ntotal average power of 500 kW from the source. In the feeder\nII, several linear unbalanced loads as well as rectiﬁer loads\nare connected.\nThe steady state performance of the system when ST is\nnot compensating for feeder II loads is shown in Fig. 5.\nThe three phase PCC voltages, grid currents, MV rectiﬁer\ncurrents, and feeder II currents are shown in Fig. 5(a)-(d),\nrespectively. The MV rectiﬁer takes currents required for the\ncontinuous operation of the loads from the source. These\nrectiﬁer currents are in phase with the respective phase PCC\nvoltages. Also, these currents are balanced and sinusoidal. As\nfar as currents in feeder II are concerned, these are unbalanced\nand have signiﬁcant reactive components. Therefore, the total\ngrid currents also have signiﬁcant reactive components and are\nunbalanced as well.\nSimulated waveforms when the ST control is activated to\ncompensate for the unbalance and reactive currents of feeder\nII are shown in Fig. 6. By comparing the waveforms of the\nPCC voltages and grid currents as given in Fig. 6(a) and\n(b), respectively, it can be noticed that the respective phase\nvoltages and currents are in phase with each other. Also,\nthe three phase grid currents are approximately balanced and\nsinusoidal. Therefore, the grid only supplies for the real power\nrequirements of the loads connected to the PCC of the system.\nConsequently, this scheme does not require power quality\nimprovement device to the feeder II. Fig. 6(c) shows the\nthree phase rectiﬁer currents. These includes the real current\nneeded to support the loads at feeder I as well as the currents\nneeded to compensate the loads connected to the feeder II.\nThe loads connected to the feeder II draw currents as per the\nrequirements and are given in Fig. 6(d).\nPerformance of the proposed ST based power system during\ntransient conditions is shown in Fig. 7.

C ONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, the operation and control of a futuristic power\ndistribution system consisting of two radial feeders with one\nCPT replaced by an ST is presented. It is shown that the ST\ncan compensate for the loads connected at the feeder supplied\nby the CPTs, in addition to supplying their own loads. This\nscheme has potential to eliminate the requirement of power\nquality improvement devices such as STATCOM, power factor\ncorrecting capacitors, etc., connected at the second feeder. This\nancillary feature in the medium voltage power distribution\nsystems has potential to make application of ST more attractive\nand cost effective.\nVI.
