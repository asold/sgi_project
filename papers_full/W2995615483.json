  "abstract": "Condition monitoring of power transformers has attracted a lot of attention due to their important roles in determining power system reliability. Radial deformation of power transformer winding should be monitored online to prevent more damages to winding and possible transformer outage. The ultra‐high‐frequency (UHF) stepped‐frequency synthetic‐aperture radar imaging method has recently been proposed as an online method for high‐voltage winding radial deformation detection. On the other hand, partial discharge (PD) as another defect of the transformer winding propagates UHF signals in the transformer environment, which should be detected online. In this study, the practical application of a designed monitoring system is investigated for simultaneous online detection of both PD and radial deformation defects in a real three‐phase power transformer. In addition, radial deformation is localised through a monitoring system designed based on the proposed method. Using this system, only one set of antennas is needed to detect both defects which lead to reducing the number of installed antennas and economic application of the monitoring system.",
