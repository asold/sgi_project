González-Castaño \nInformation Technologies Group, atlanTTic, University of Vigo,  \nSchool of Telecommunications Engineering, Maxwell street, 36310 Vigo, Spain \nABSTRACT \nMobile learning or mLearning has become an essential tool in many fields in this digital era, among the ones educational \ntraining deserves special attention, that is, applied to both basic and higher education towards active, flexible, effective \nhigh-quality and continuous learning. However, despite the advances in Natural Language Processing techniques, \nmLearning still does not take full advantage of the great potential of the latter techniques. It is the case of the transform er \nlanguage models distributed in chatbot form. Accordingl y, this work presents a mLearning application based on OpenAI \nGPT-3 model, which enables user-friendly interactions. The proposed system was tested in two evaluation scenarios, and \nthe experimental results endorse its appropriateness toward learning experience enhancement. \nKEYWORDS \nHigher Education, Intelligent Virtual Assistant, Mobile Learning, Natural Language Processing, User-Generated Content, \nTransformer Language Models \n1. INTRODUCTION \nMobile learning or mLearning  allows to gather knowledge and develop skills by exploiting mobile \ntechnologies. mLearning exploits all media types (audio, text, visual data, etc.) at any place and time (Crompton \n& Burke, 2018). Consequently, it has become an essential tool in this digital era, driven by the recent advances \nin communication networks, information technologies, and learning applications (Bai, 2019). All levels of \neducation have been affected by digitalization which promotes practice-based learning instead of just offering \ntheoretical knowledge. Particularly, mLearning has been extensively used in both basic and higher educational \nlevels, being a critical component in the latter towards high -quality, active, and continuous education \n(Crompton & Burke, 2018). As a result, mLearning is established as a strategic tool to enhance university \nstudent capacities (Pinto et al., 2020). There exist several mobile technologies use d in mLearning, such as \neBooks, smartphones, tablets, etc. Among them, mobile phones are the most common devices due to their \nmulti-task nature (audio, image, and video recording capabilities, and all kinds of educational software \navailable) (Crompton & Burke, 2018; Hartley & Bendixen, 2019). \nIts flexible and convenient nature (Pedro et al., 2018) is highly attractive to digital natives who seek a fully \nimmersive learning experience. However, learning experience enhancement can only be achieved through \nwell-designed learning solutions (Parsazadeh et al., 2018). Accordingly, consideration should be given to \nadvanced mLearning approaches to ensure learning effectiveness. In this line, transformer language models are \nrelevant to this work. They are intended to solve sequence -to-sequence tasks and handle long -term \ndependencies by relying on the self-attention mechanism based on the encoder-decoder architecture. More in \ndetail, the input word embeddings enter the first encoder, and then they are transformed and propagated to the \nnext encoder. The output is obtained after decoding. These models are the most advanced for Natural Language \nGeneration and are distributed in a chatbot form (Brown et al. 2020). A chatbot is a conversational agent able \nto interact with use rs in a natural way using textual or voice -based interfaces in order to answer questions, \nestablish a conversion on any topic or even perform a certain task. This technology has been applied in multiple \ndomains, such as customer service and, especially to education and training (Tallyn et al., 2018). Users can \nbenefit from the instant availability of mLearning applications and the ability to respond naturally using \nchatbots. Accordingly, this work contributes with a transformer language model -based mobile a pplication \nInternational Conferences e-Society 2023 and Mobile Learning 2023\n391\nwhich exploits Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable user-friendly interactions to enhance mLearning \nacceptance of both educators and learners, inside and outside of the classroom. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature on mLearning to support \nthe motivation of the present work. Section 3 presents the proposed solution, while Section 4 details the \nimplementation decisions and displays the experimental results obtained. Finally, Section 5 conclud es the \narticle. \n2. RELATED WORK \nmLearning solutions are nowadays official tools in both classrooms and workplaces, but they are also relevant \nsystems outside these environments, at homes for teleworking and remote education, respectively (Kumar \nBasak, 2018). They seek to provide new efficient ways of learning and also remove the existing limitations in \nthe process with the ultimate objective of meeting the learner's needs. As previously mentioned, mLearning \nwas originally developed as a way to save resources ( money and time) while at the same time enabling  \nhigh-quality, easier and faster learning. Learning processes involve challenging tasks such as comprehension, \ndesign, problem-solving, debugging, etc. (Malik et al., 2020). Thus, Technology Enhanced Learning  (TEL) \nand Learning Analytics (LA) constitute relevant approaches for enhancing users’ learning satisfaction in \nmultimodal learning environments compared or combined with traditional methodologies (Mota et al., 2018). \nThe European Digital Agenda 2020 1 seeks to perform strategic ICT (Information and Communications \nTechnology) research and innovation actions like promoting digital skills and inclusion. Among Good Practice \nTeaching (GPT) (Romero -Rodríguez et al., 2020), which involves cooperative work, knowle dge, and  \nself-regulation training along with the development of digital competence, educational chatbot solutions are \nappropriate. The latter solutions promote human -machine interaction and engagement (Smutny  \n& Schreiberova, 2020). This is the case with t he Ethnobot chatbot (Tallyn et al., 2018), which asks users \nethnographic-related questions. However, the most advanced technology for chatbot design is the \naforementioned language transformer models. Particularly, OpenAI, an Artificial Intelligence researc h and \ndeployment company, provides three different models depending on the use case: GPT -3, oriented to NLP, \nCodex for programming users, and Content filter to detect whether a text may be confidential or insecure \n(Brown et al. 2020). However, none of them focus on the educational field. \nIn the particular case of Spain, mLearning has started to be applied to preschool and primary levels \n(Romero-Rodríguez, 2020). The results obtained show a positive increase in motivating the learners and \nimproving their learning outcomes (Bai, 2019). However, there is still work to be done in digital competence \ndevelopment in Spain (Fuentes et al., 2019), even though it is the fifth country in the world regarding the \nnumber of smartphone and Internet users 2. Therefore, the Instituto Nacional de Tecnologías Educativas y \nFormación del Profesorado (INTEF) indicated the necessity to promote the latter digital competence among \nstudents (Romero -Rodríguez, 2020) beyond Learning Management System (LMS) software (Antonova  \n& Bontchev, 2020). LMS is very popular at higher levels (Abazi -Bexheti et al., 2018). Examples of LMS \ninclude Blackboard, Edmodo, Google Classroom, Moodle, Sakai, and Schoology. In this line, Andrei et al. \n(2019) presented the Open Virtual Mobility Learning Hub which  combines different interactive learning \nmethodologies in open-source frameworks like MOODLE. Learning apps are also very common, the second \nmost popular category on Google Play (Singh & Suri, 2022). Take Duolingo, Quizlet, SoloLearn as \nrepresentative examples. \nRegarding prior research on mLearning, Mota et al. (2018) presented a framework to create applications \nwith augmented reality, while Oyelere et al. (2018) developed MobileEdu focusing on computing education \nfor university students following a blended  learning approach, that is, combining mlearning and traditional \nface-to-face teaching (Nogueira & Paniago, 2022). Furthermore, Parsazadeh et al.  (2018) presented a  \nJigsaw-based mLearning application that combines interactive and cooperative learning to p romote peer and \ngroup interaction. More recently, Nazar et al. (2022) created an Android app to comprehend the concept of \nredox in Chemistry for university students. Other popular use cases include language (Brata et al., 2019) and \n \n1 Available at https://library.educause.edu/resources/2019/4/2019-horizon-report, January 2023. \n2 Available at https://compromiso.atresmedia.com/levanta-la-cabeza/quienes-somos/movimiento-uso-responsable-\ntecnologia_201901245c49b0f20cf238d4657881bc.html, January 2023. \nISBN: 978-989-8704-47-4 © 2023\n392\n \n \ncode (Troussas et al., 2 020; App Inventor and Scratch) learning. Accordingly, Liu (2022) developed an \nmLearning application to improve the English language among college students, which combines gamification \nand collaborative/competitive learning. More closely related to our work is the WeChat application developed \nby Ng et al. (2020), the most popular collaborative learning application used among Chinese students. \nThis work contributes to all the fundamental perspectives of mLearning: (contribution -i) cognitive (how \nthe brain ope rates during learning), (c -ii) emotional (engagement, motivation, etc.), (c -iii) behavioral \n(outcomes of the learning process), and (c -iv) contextual (interaction and collaboration). Consequently, the \nproposed intelligent mobile application seeks learning optimization in a virtual and adaptive environment by \nexploiting NLP techniques over the content (c -i and c-iii). It also adapts the utterances to the emotional state \nof the users thanks to its sentiment analysis (SA) and empathetic module to prevent frust ration and promote \nconfidence (c-ii). Note that the latter feature is especially relevant since the emotional state of the learner is \nstrongly related to the outcome of the learning process (Singh & Suri, 2022). Finally, the system uses an \ninnovative communication approach with a transformer language model (c-iv). \n3. PROPOSED METHOD \nThe proposed virtual learning assistant is depicted in Figure 1. In this figure, the conversational server and \nclient application are illustrated. The solution is intended for both  professors and students and was especially \ndesigned for the Spanish language, even though its adaptation to other languages may be considered \nstraightforward. Thanks to the pre -trained model available, this solution will be able to accommodate any \neducational issue without prior training or additional information.  The assistant provides automatic question \ngeneration and free dialogue functionalities. In the particular case of students, the virtual assistant enables \ndoubts resolution. \n3.1 Conversational Server \nThe conversational server is the core of the system and allows to automatically generate interactions with the \nusers in the form of questions or free dialogue. The system utterances are enriched following a template-based \napproach to ensure that the human-machine interaction is satisfactory. \n3.1.1 ML Model Selection Module \nOnce the request is received from the client, it is necessary to select the Machine Learning (ML) model to \ngenerate the system output. Accordingly, the model with a higher computational cost is selected. If the latter \nmodel is not available, that is, request errors are being produced, or there is a response time greater than 30 \nseconds, the next model based on higher computational cost is selected. \n3.1.2 Playground Manager Module \nThe playgrounds in OpenAI are composed of templates that contextualize the dialogue in a specific area or \ntopic and ensure that the system response is appropriate. Thus, this module allows to management of the \navailable playgrounds and includes relevant features like personalization, empathy, and feedback. \nPersonalization stage . It detects the profile of the user (teacher or student), the conversation type \n(automatic question generation or free dialogue), and the area and topic of the conversation. The history of the \ninteractions is also managed in this stage (maximum history of six utterances). Firstly, the users indicate their \nrole, and since the words teacher or student (or synonyms of these words) may be absent, the system identifies \nthe role with the following template in the playground, “ Si te dijese  [USER ROLE DEFINITION IN \nNATURAL LANGUAGE], ¿qué dirías que soy un profesor o un alumno? Contesta con una sola palabra ”  \n(If I told you [USER ROLE DEFINITION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE], what would you say I am, a teacher \nor a student? Answer with one word). The system returns the role of the user, and only when “teacher” or \n“student” is identified the conversation continues. Otherwise, the system keeps asking the users about their \nroles. Then, the operation m ode is detected using the following templates, “ Soy un/una docente. Si te dijese \n[USER OPERATION MODE DEFINITION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE], ¿qué dirías que he elegido de las \nopciones disponibles: generar preguntas de examen, chat abierto? Contesta con una sola de las opciones de \nInternational Conferences e-Society 2023 and Mobile Learning 2023\n393\nla lista ” (I am a teacher. If I told you [USER OPERATION MODE DEFINITION IN NATURAL \nLANGUAGE], what would you say I have chosen from the available options: exam question generation, free \ndialogue? Answer with only one of the options from  the list) and “ Soy un/a estudiante, si te dijese  [USER \nOPERATION MODE DEFINITION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE],  ¿qué dirías que he elegido de las \nopciones disponibles: generar preguntas de auto-evaluación, resolver dudas, chat abierto? Contesta con una \nsola de las opciones de la lista” (I am a student, if I told you [USER OPERATION MODE DEFINITION IN \nNATURAL LANGUAGE], what would you say that I have chosen from the available options: generate self -\nassessment questions, resolve doubts, free dialogue? Answer with only one of the options from the list), for the \nteacher and student roles, respectively. Finally, if the question generation functionality was previously detected \nfor the teacher or student role, it is time to infer the area and topic of the conversation. Acc ordingly, a similar \ntemplate is used, “ Si te dijese [USER AREA AND TOPIC DEFINITION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE] , ¿a \nqué área y temática me refiero? Contesta siguiendo el siguiente formato, materia: A, tema: B ” (If I told you \n[USER AREA AND TOPIC DEFINITION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE], what area and topic am I referring \nto? Answer using the following format, area: A, topic: B). \n \n \nFigure 1. System scheme \nSA and empathetic stage. The system generates sentences adapted to the state of mind of the users since \nit has been trained to follow this template “ El asistente es dinámico, nunca repite dos veces lo mismo, es \ncreativo, es inteligente y muy amable ” (The assistant is dynamic, it never repeats the same thing twice, it is \ncreative, intelligent and very kind). During the q uiz with the students (system automatic question generation \nand user response), if three consecutive mistakes are made by the student, the assistant asks how the student \nfeels. The latter response is analyzed using the template “Si te digo [USER STATE OF MIND DEFINITION \nIN NATURAL LANGUAGE]  dirías que estoy ¿triste o feliz? ” (If I told you [USER STATE OF MIND \nDEFINITION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE] would you say I am happy or sad?). If the emotion “tristeza” \n(sad) is detected, questions from a lower difficulty level will be presented to the student. \nFeedback stage. The empathetic nature of the assistant defined in the previous stage is combined with the \nfeedback provided to the users. The latter is possible thanks to the template “Soy un/a estudiante y a la pregunta \n[ASSISTANT QUESTION] he contestado  [USER ANSWER]. Dime si mi respuesta es 100% correcta, \nparcialmente correcta o no es correcta. Y explícame el porqué ” (I am a student and to the question \n[ASSISTANT QUESTION] I have answered [USER ANSWER]. Please tell me if my answer is 100% correct, \npartially correct or incorrect. And explain to me why). \nFinally, for the utterances generation of the virtual assistant, there exist several additional playgrounds \ndepending on the role and action previously chosen. \n• Exam quest ion generation for the teacher role . The template used is “ Soy un/a docente con \nconocimientos avanzados, necesitaría generar una pregunta para un examen de [ASSISTANT \nAREA AND TOPIC DETECTED]” (I am a teacher with advanced knowledge, I would need to \ngenerate a question for an exam [ASSISTANT AREA AND TOPIC DETECTED]). \n• Self-assessment for the student role . The template used is “ Soy un/a estudiante, necesitaría \npracticar para un examen de [ASSISTANT AREA AND TOPIC DETECTED] . Genérame una \npregunta al respecto ” (I am a student, I would need to practice for a [ASSISTANT AREA AND \nTOPIC DETECTED] exam. Give me a question about it). \nISBN: 978-989-8704-47-4 © 2023\n394\n \n \n• Doubts resolution for the student role. The template used is “Soy un/a estudiante. Necesitaría que \nme resolvieras esta pregunta [USER QUESTION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE]” (I am a student.  \nI need you to solve this question [USER QUESTION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE]). \n3.1.3 Data Processing Module \nText processing is essential for personalization, SA, and empathetic stages. Thus, this module deletes symbols, \nURLs, and other non-alphanumeric content. \n3.2 Data Manager \nThe main functionality of this module is to serve as an abstraction layer between the conversational server, the \nML model selector, and the client application. Server -client data a re sent and received in JSON format. In \naddition, JSON allows the status of the conversion to be established by identifying the type of interlocutor and \nthe number of interactions, as well as the immediately preceding questions and conversations, thus, act ing as \nan intermediate lazy cache. \n3.3 Client Application \nIt serves as the system access interface for the end users. This module identifies the number of interactions that \nhave been carried out in the free chat functionality. In addition, the cleaning of the user cache is performed \nwhen the user ends the conversation with the “terminate” command. \n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nThis section presents the implementation decisions. In the end, the evaluation results are discussed. \n4.1 Conversational Server \nThis module was deployed as a Flask server (version 2.2.2) with a Gunicorn traffic balancer (version 20.1.0) \nusing Python programming language (version 3.8). \n4.1.1 ML Model Selection Module \nFor the generation of sentences, the system uses the GPT-3 transformer language model (version 3.5) provided \nby OpenAI. \n4.1.2 Playground Manager Module \nIn order to either reduce the randomness of the response or guarantee the maximum dynamism of the dialogues, \nthe temperature parameter was set as follows (0 and 1, respectively). \n• Personalization stage. Temperature = 0. \n• SA and empathetic stage . Temperature = 0 when using the templates to train the assistant and \nTemperature = 1 when generating empathetic interactions. \n• Feedback stage. Temperature = 1. \n4.1.3 Data Processing Module \nRegular expressions are exploited to detect both symbols (“#”, “´”, “;”, “`”, “~”, “&”, “.”, “?”, “¿”, “!”, “¡”) \nand URLs (starting with http, https, pic, and www). \n \n \n \n \nInternational Conferences e-Society 2023 and Mobile Learning 2023\n395\n4.2 Data Manager \nThe Python http module is used for request management on the client side while, on the server, the Flask \nlibrary. In addition, for the generation of requests against the transformer language model, the OpenAI Python \nlibrary is used. \n4.3 Client Application \nThe client has been designed using the cross-platform Flutter language; hence the proposed system is accessible \nfrom Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android as a native application or from a browser. For the design of the chat, \nthe Flyer Chat library was used. A model-view-controller paradigm was followed. \n4.4 Case Study \nIn our study, a total of 100 interactions have been manually annotated by two NLP experts. Particularly, two \nevaluation scenarios have been set. \nScenario 1 . Five thematic areas with a single topic (history – World War II, biology – cellular and \nbiochemistry, mathematics – differential equations, medicine – human anatomy, engineering – Python \nprogramming) and ten questions each have been generated using the a ssistant. The following evaluation \nquestions were used, EQ1: Is the question generated by the assistant related to the area requested?, EQ2: Is the \nquestion useful for an exam?, EQ3: Are there any grammatical errors, or its construction is inconsistent? \nScenario 2. The answers to the questions generated for the previous scenarios are evaluated using, EQ4: Is \nthe answer related to the question?, EQ5: Is the concept clearly explained to a student?, EQ6: Are there any \ngrammatical errors, or its construction is inconsistent? \n4.5 Annotation Results \nTables 1 and 2 show the results obtained for the first and second evaluation scenarios, respectively. Results are \nprovided in terms of the percentage of affirmative answers to the evaluation questions. The values of the first \nevaluation scenario range from 92% to 100% for EQ1 and EQ2. Thus, the questions generated by the assistant \nare both within the area and topic of the dialogue and appropriate to be included in the exam. The number of \ngrammatical and coherent error s is minimal (up to 6%). In the second evaluation scenario (see Table 2), the \nresults obtained for EQ4 and EQ5 are even higher, between 94% and 100%. However, grammatical and \ncoherence errors are more frequent (up to 14%). The latter fact is due to the gre ater difficulty in generating \ncomplete answers to the questions generated to be used in an exam (second scenario) compared to creating the \nquestions themselves (first scenario). \nTable 1. Percentage of affirmative answers of the two annotators for the first evaluation scenario \n EQ1 EQ2 EQ3 \nAnnotator 1 98% 92% 4% \nAnnotator 2 96% 100% 6% \nTable 2. Percentage of affirmative answers of the two annotators for the second evaluation scenario \n EQ4 EQ5 EQ6 \nAnnotator 1 100% 94% 12% \nAnnotator 2 100% 98% 14% \n5. CONCLUSION \nThere exist a variety of mLearning solutions that are being exploited in classrooms and workplaces as new \nefficient tools to meet the learner’s needs while removing the existing limitations in the process, such as time \nand location constraints. The latter proliferation of mLeaning systems has been driven not only by private \nISBN: 978-989-8704-47-4 © 2023\n396\n \n \nparties as the end users themselves but also by the European Digital Agenda 2020, and the Spanish INTEF to \npromote digital skills. \nIn this line, this work seeks to fully exploit the latest advances in NLP techniques in an intelligent virtual \nassistant based on the transformer language model GPT -3 by OpenAI. Our solution is composed of a \nconversational server and a client application. Among its most relevant features are the personalized and \nemphatic utterances along with the feedback provided during the dialogues with the users. Experimental results \nshow that the questions generated by the assistant are both within the area and topic o f the dialogue (up to 98 \n%), appropriate to be included in the exam (up to 100 %), and fully explanatory (100 %) to a student (98 %). \nThe number of grammatical and coherent errors is minimal (up to 14 %). A real example of a conversation \nwith the virtual assistant is shown in Figure 2. The user, in this case, is a student that wants to practice for a \nchemistry exam about redox reactions. \n \n \nFigure 2. Integration of the system in a multiplatform application \nIn future work, the dialogues generated in the mobile application can be mined to recommend adjustments \nin learning methods.
