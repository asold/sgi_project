Overreliance on \nvisual stimuli could hinder \nstudents' ability to develop \ncritical thinking skills and \nanalyze information deeply. \nA balanced approach that \nincorporates LVMs alongside \ntraditional learning methods \nis essential. \n \n• The cost and access gap: \nLVMs require powerful \nhardware and internet \nconnections, which can be \nexpensive and inaccessible to \nsome schools and students. \nThis could exacerbate \nexisting educational \ndisparities and further \ndisadvantage underprivileged \ncommunities. Equitable \naccess to LVM technology is \nis crucial for inclusive AI -\npowered learning. \nregardless of their \nbackground or \nsocioeconomic status. \n• The teacher's role redefined: \nLLMs are not here to replace \nteachers; they're here to \nempower them. The human \nelement of education, \nincluding critical thinking, \nsocial-emotional learning, \nand the power of human \nconnection, remains \nirreplaceable. LLMs should  \nbe seen as valuable tools to \nsupport teachers, not \nsubstitutes for their expertise \nand dedication. \ncrucial for ensuring inclusive \neducation. \n• The teacher's role redefined: \nLVMs are not here to replace \nteachers; they're here to \nempower them. Teachers \nremain crucial in guiding \nstudents' learning, \ninterpreting LVM -generated \ncontent, and fostering critical \nthinking skills. LVMs should \nbe seen as val uable tools to \nsupport teachers, not \nsubstitutes for their expertise \nand guidance. \n \nThe role of artificial intelligence, large language models, and large vision models in education is undeniably \ntransformative. While these technologies present unprecedented opportunities to enhance learning \nexperiences, it is imperative to navigate the associated challenges with caution. Striking a balance between \ninnovation, ethical considerations, and privacy concerns will be key in harnessing the full potential of AI \nto revolutionize education for the benefit of students and educators alike. \nReferences:  \n[1] S.
