    "abstract": "In past Evaluations for Machine Translation of European Languages, it could be shown that the translation performance of SMT systems can be increased by integrating a bilingual lan- guage model into a phrase-based SMT system. In the bilingual language model, target words with their aligned source words build the tokens of an n-gram based language model. We analyzed the effect of bilingual language models and show where they could help to bet- ter model the translation process. We could show improvements of translation quality on German-to-English and Arabic-to-English. In addition, for the Arabic-to-English task, train- ing an extra bilingual language model on the POS tags instead of the surface word forms led to further improvements.",
