  "abstract": "Introduction The brain functional network can describe the spontaneous activity of nerve cells and reveal the subtle abnormal changes associated with brain disease. It has been widely used for analyzing early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and exploring pathological mechanisms. However, the current methods of constructing functional connectivity networks from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) heavily depend on the software toolboxes, which may lead to errors in connection strength estimation and bad performance in disease analysis because of many subjective settings. Methods To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel Adversarial Temporal-Spatial Aligned Transformer (ATAT) model is proposed to automatically map 4D fMRI into functional connectivity network for early AD analysis. By incorporating the volume and location of anatomical brain regions, the region-guided feature learning network can roughly focus on local features for each brain region. Also, the spatial-temporal aligned transformer network is developed to adaptively adjust boundary features of adjacent regions and capture global functional connectivity patterns of distant regions. Furthermore, a multi-channel temporal discriminator is devised to distinguish the joint distributions of the multi-region time series from the generator and the real sample. Results Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) proved the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed model in early AD prediction and progression analysis. Discussion To verify the reliability of the proposed model, the detected important ROIs are compared with clinical studies and show partial consistency. Furthermore, the most significant altered connectivity reflects the main characteristics associated with AD. Conclusion Generally, the proposed ATAT provides a new perspective in constructing functional connectivity networks and is able to evaluate the disease-related changing characteristics at different stages for neuroscience exploration and clinical disease analysis.",
