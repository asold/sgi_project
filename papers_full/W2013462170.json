    "abstract": "In this work, we present a stochastic approach to shallow parsing. Most of the current approaches to shallow parsing have a common characteristic: they take the sequence of lexical tags proposed by a POS tagger as input for the chunking process. Our system produces tagging and chunking in a single process using an Integrated Language Model (ILM) formalized as Markov Models. This model integrates several knowledge sources: lexical probabilities, a contextual Language Model (LM) for every chunk, and a contextual LM for the sentences. We have extended the ILM by adding lexical information to the contextual LMs. We have applied this approach to the CoNLL-2000 shared task improving the performance of the chunker.",
