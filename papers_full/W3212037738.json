Visual Question Answer-\ning (VQA) (Wu et al., 2017) is a speciﬁc example\nof the challenge, where, given a natural language\nquestion about an accompanying image, the sys-\ntem is required to produce a correct answer. This\nis a typical multimodal problem since the intelli-\n∗These authors contributed equally to this work and\nshould be considered co-ﬁrst authors.\n†Corresponding author.\n[Candidate answer list]\nBlue; Yellow; Red; Gold \nGold\nIntelligence systems with\nbilinear methods\nRed\nIntelligence systems with\ntrilinear methods\n❌\n✔\n[Question]\nWhat is the main color of the train?\nFigure 1: Visual question answering task1\ngence system needs to understand images and texts\nsimultaneously.\nFrom the perspective of a single modality, there\nhave been plenty of backbone methods for learning\nbetter representations of either language or vision.\nFor learning language representations, researchers\nhave developed several pre-trained models, such as\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019). These ap-\nproaches can learn the universal language represen-\ntations on the large-scale corpus, which are beneﬁ-\ncial for downstream tasks (Qiu et al., 2020). Con-\ncerning visual representations, He et al. (2016);\nRen et al. (2017); Simonyan and Zisserman (2015)\nhave been widely applied to extract image features.\nDespite the success of these single-modality works,\nlearning the relationships between different modal-\nities is still an unsolved problem.\nExisting VQA approaches focus on modeling\nthe relationship between visual and language fea-\ntures represented by bilinear models. For ex-\nample, through applying bilinear feature fusion\nmethods, the image and text representations are\nprojected into a uniformed higher-dimensional\nspace. Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling\n(MCB) (Fukui et al., 2016) processes the vec-\ntors in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) space. For\n1An example of image-question-answer pair from Vi-\nsual7W dataset (Zhu et al., 2016)\n2281\nbetter cross-modality information exchange, (Yu\net al., 2019) and (Tan and Bansal, 2019) utilize co-\nattention/cross-attention networks to capture the\nhigh-level fusion features. Generally, these bilinear\napproaches only consider how to learn the joint rep-\nresentations between the questions and the images\nwhile the answers are processed as labels, making\nVQA task a multi-class classiﬁcation task (Tan and\nBansal, 2019; Zhu et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2019; Li\net al., 2020).\nHowever, the answers contain semantic informa-\ntion, related to the question and the visual context.\nFor considering the answer information, trilinear\nmodels represented by Compact Trilinear Interac-\ntion (CTI) (Do et al., 2019), are designed to learn\nthe alignment relationships between the visual con-\ntext, the answers, and the questions. Unfortunately,\nthe trilinear interaction in CTI only considers the\ninter-modality relationships but ignores the intra-\nmodality information, leading to unsatisfactory in-\nference results.\nTo tackle the above problems in the context\nof VQA, we propose a new trilinear modali-\nties interaction framework called MIRTT (Learn-\ning Multimodal Interaction Representations from\nTrilinear Transformers). Speciﬁcally, MIRTT can\nextract more reﬁned high-level feature informa-\ntion from the inter-modality and intra-modality\nrelationships by introducing interactive attention\nnetworks across three modalities and three self-\nattention networks within a single modality. In\ngeneral, MIRTT can accommodate requirements\nfor processing three different modal features and\nefﬁciently utilize the information from the answers.\nThe contributions of our work are as follows:\n• By considering the inter-modality and intra-\nmodality relationships, we introduce a new\nend-to-end trilinear interaction model MIRTT,\nthat enhances each single modality representa-\ntion by proposed attention networks, resulting\nin better inference ability in VQA.\n• We propose a two-stage workﬂow to sim-\nplify the harder Free-Form Opened-Ended\n(FFOE) VQA into simpler Multiple Choice\n(MC) VQA, which provides a method to solve\ndifﬁcult VQA tasks.\n• Our proposed MIRTT achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance on Visual7W telling\ntask (Zhu et al., 2016) and VQA-1.0 for MC\nVQA and outperforms the bilinear methods on\nthe VQA-2.0 (Goyal et al., 2017), (Kaﬂe and\nKanan, 2017a) and GQA (Hudson and Man-\nning, 2019) datasets for FFOE VQA. More-\nover, we take advantage of the pre-training\ntask on our model, improving multi-modality\nunderstanding.\n2 Related Work\nVisual question answering (VQA) task. Follow-\ning Antol et al. (2015) who deﬁned the VQA\ntask (i.e., obtaining answers from a given image-\nquestion pair), has received signiﬁcant attention\nfrom the entire artiﬁcial intelligence commu-\nnity (Wu et al., 2017). There are two major types\nof VQA tasks, Multiple Choice (MC) VQA and\nFree-Form Opened-Ended (FFOE) VQA (Do et al.,\n2019). In MC VQA (Zhu et al., 2016; Kaﬂe and\nKanan, 2017b), the answer is chosen from a candi-\ndate answer list for a given image-question pair ac-\ncessible in both training and test scenarios. FFOE\nVQA is more complicated since the answers are\nonly available in the training phase, and there is no\ncandidate answer list for choosing answers. How-\never, FFOE VQA is the most common VQA task\nand almost all models are aimed at this problem.\nThe general solution is to extract the visual fea-\ntures and linguist features ﬁrst and then fuse them\nwith a multi-modality fusion model, followed by a\nclassiﬁer or a generator to obtain the answer (Wu\net al., 2017). Among them, exploring different\nfusion approaches is the mainstream research direc-\ntion. On the one hand, the interactive relationships\nbetween the query image and the question have\nbeen fully modeled, such as element-wise oper-\nations (Antol et al., 2015) and bilinear methods\n(Fukui et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018; Ben-Younes\net al., 2017, 2019). On the other hand, some works\nhave improved the VQA performance by consid-\nering the answer information (Hu et al., 2018; Do\net al., 2019). For example, Jabri et al. (2016) com-\nbines the three input representations through a sim-\nple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Wang et al.\n(2018) introduces a layered fusion operation by\nmerging the image-question bilinear embeddings\nand the image-answer bilinear embeddings in joint\nembedding space. In order to solve VQA in a tar-\ngeted manner, we make full use of the answer infor-\nmation and propose a two-stage workﬂow, which\nconverts FFOE VQA to MC VQA.\nAttention-based networks. Inspired by human’s\nnatural mechanism, Yang et al. (2016) introduce the\nattention mechanism to VQA and achieve success.\n2282\nFor bilinear feature fusion, some attention mecha-\nnisms have been proposed, such as co-attention (Lu\net al., 2016) and dual attention (Nam et al., 2017).\nIn terms of trilinear feature fusion, the attention\nmap for trilinear inputs is computed by PARAL-\nING decomposition (Do et al., 2019). However, the\noutput is only a joint vector for classiﬁcation. In\norder to enhance each single modality representa-\ntion by fusing the other modalities, we propose\nTrilinear Interaction Attention (TrI-Att). More-\nover, although self-attention can not fuse different\nmodalities, it can enhance the interaction within\neach modality (Yu et al., 2019). Therefore, we de-\nsign Self-Attention (Self-Att) unit for capturing the\nintra-modality information.\nMultimodal contextual representations. The\ntransformer-based models can achieve good per-\nformance in the vision-language tasks. These mod-\nels normally employ multi-layer transformers to\nlearn multimodal contextual representations. There\nare two basic types of their architectures: single-\nstream and two-stream. The single-stream models\nconcatenate image and language features ﬁrst, and\nthen they get the cross-modality representations\nwith a single multi-layer transformer, such as VL-\nBERT (Su et al., 2020) and UNITER (Chen et al.,\n2020). The two-stream models take advantage of\nself-attention transformers to encode language and\nimage features respectively, and then build joint\nrepresentations with cross-attention transformers,\nsuch as LXMERT (Tan and Bansal, 2019) and ViL-\nVERT (Lu et al., 2019). To better align vision-\nlanguage semantic, some works try to pre-train\ntransformer-based structures on a large corpus of\nimage-text pairs. The pre-training tasks usually\ninclude masked language prediction, RoI-feature\nregression, detected-label classiﬁcation and cross-\nmodality matching (Tan and Bansal, 2019). In this\npaper, our proposed trilinear transformers deal with\nthe three input embeddings different from former\ntransformer-based methods.\n3 MIRTT: Learning M ultimodal\nInteraction Representations from\nTrilinear Transformers\nAs shown in Figure 3, our model considers three\nmodality forms of input (e.g., images, questions\nand answers). The backbone of MIRTT is two\ntransformers with multiple layers, which are based\non TrI-Att and Self-Att mechanisms. Finally, in\nthe output layer, we adopt MLP for speciﬁc down-\nstream tasks.\n3.1 Single-modality Embedding Extraction\nImage embeddings. The image embeddings are\nextracted from a Faster R-CNN model (Anderson\net al., 2018), a regional visual feature extractor. In\nterms of speciﬁcation, for each object, it extracts\na vector with dv dimensions. Therefore, an im-\nage with v objects is represented as an embedding\nmatrix V ∈Rv×dv .\nQuestion and answer embeddings. We adopt\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to ﬁne-tune as our text\nextractor in the experiments. Speciﬁcally, the text\nis converted to WordPiece embeddings ﬁrst (Wu\net al., 2016). Then through ﬁne-tuning, each em-\nbedding will be projected intoRdq or Rda , for ques-\ntion and answer, respectively. Finally, the question\nwith a max length ofq is represented asQ ∈Rq×dq ,\nand the same for the answer that A ∈Ra×da .\n3.2 Trilinear Transformers\nImage Embedding\nQuestion Embedding\nAnswer Embedding\nM\nTrI-Att\nfQ\nfA\nfV\nFigure 2: Trilinear interaction attention\nTrI-Att for inter-modality representations. For\nbetter cross-modality information fusion, we de-\nsign TrI-Att to project single-modality embed-\nding into inter-modality enhanced space (Figure\n2). From section 3.1, let S = {V, Q, A}be the\nmultimodal input collection. Firstly, we introduce\nthe attention map M ∈Rv×q×a, which is mainly\ncomputed by matrix multiplication and sum-based\ndimension reduction. The detailed calculation pro-\ncess is as follows:\nM = softmax\n(∑\ndv\n∑\ndq\n∑\nda V ⊗Q ⊗A\n√\nd\n)\n(1)\nwhere softmax is a normalization operation of all\nelements in M, and d is the arithmetic mean of dv,\n2283\nImage Embedding\nQuestion Embedding\nAnswer Embedding\nImage \nExtractor\nText \nExtractor\nText \nExtractor\nSelf-Att\n𝑁𝐿 ×\nFF FF\nImage representations\nSelf-Att\nFF FF\nQuestion representations\nSelf-Att\nFF FF\nAnswer representations\nSingle modality Transformer\nTrI-Att\nMultiple modalities Transformer\nTrilinear transformer\nFigure 3: Model architecture of MIRTT\ndq and da. Secondly, the fusion of initial single-\nmodality representation and the attention map f is\nconducted as follows:\nfV =\n∑\nq\n∑\na\nMV = TrI-AttV(V, Q, A) (2)\nhere, we take image representation V for example\n(questions and answers are as the same), and the\nfusion operation is similar to Eq. 1.\nWe further utilize multi-head attention (Vaswani\net al., 2017) to improve the robustness by intro-\nducing a linear mapping for each single-modality\nrepresentation. In general, the complete calculation\nof inter-modality fusion is as follows:\nfV =\nNh\n||\ni\nTrI-AttVi (\nV Wi\nV , QWi\nQ, AWi\nV\n)\n(3)\nwhere Wi\nV , Wi\nQ and Wi\nA are multi-head linear map-\npings, which are shared across the three forms of\nrepresentations. Nh is the number of heads. ||\nindicates the concatenation of all multi-heads. Sim-\nilarly, the fusion representations of questions and\nanswers are:\nfQ =\nNh\n||\ni\nTrI-AttQi (\nV Wi\nV , QWi\nQ, AWi\nV\n)\n(4)\nfA =\nNh\n||\ni\nTrI-AttAi (\nV Wi\nV , QWi\nQ, AWi\nV\n)\n(5)\nAfter that, a fully connected feed-forward net-\nwork with residual connection follows.\nSelf-Att for intra-modality representations. We\napply the encoder of Transformer (Vaswani et al.,\n2017) to capture the intra-modality relationships.\nWe deploy a multi-head self-attention mechanism,\nfollowed by a feed-forward network with the resid-\nual connection. With input feature X ∈Rn×d, the\nmulti-head self-attention is working as:\nNh\n||\ni\nSelf-AttM (X) =\nNh\n||\ni\nsoftmax\n(XX T\n√\nd\n)\nXW i\nM\n(6)\nwhere Wi\nM ∈Rd×dh is the projection matrix for\na certain modality M in ith head. This structure\ncan enhance the long-distance dependency among\nthe multi-modality features, while weaken negative\nimpact on the result to a certain degree.\nTrilinear transformers stacks. In total, the tri-\nlinear transformer stacks NL layers, where each\nlayer efﬁciently combines two transformer mod-\nules. The multiple modalities transformer has a tri-\nlinear interaction attention module and a fully con-\nnected feed-forward (FF) network. And the single\nmodality transformer has three self-attention mod-\nules, following the same structure of the encoder in\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Our essential\nmotivation is to take advantage of the answer in-\nformation, so a trilinear model is deployed ﬁrst to\nfuse the three modality information. However, this\nleads to the loss of information in each modality\nto some extent, so a single-modality transformer is\nfollowed to reinforce the information of each own.\nFor the MC VQA task, we put the pooled answer\nrepresentations of the ﬁnal layer into a binary clas-\nsiﬁer. Pick the answer of the highest binary score\nas the right one.\n3.3 Two-stage Workﬂow\nIn FFOE VQA, previous models usually do not\ntake the answer as input for keeping the same input\ndimensions in the training and test phases because\n2284\nBilinear \nMethods\nTrilinear \nMethods\n[Answer1] zebras \n[Answer2] zebra\n[Answer3] giraffe\n…\n[Answern] yes\nCandidate answers list\n[Question] \nWhat animal is this?\nStage 1: FFOE task\n54%\n29%\n12%\nStage 2: MC task\nImage \nEncoder\nText \nEncoder\nText \nEncoder\nTraining / test phase\n[Answer2] \nzebra\nBilinear result\nTrilinear result\n❌\n✔\n…\nFigure 4: The overview of two-stage workﬂow2\nthe answer is not available in the test set. Knowl-\nedge distillation is a solution that trilinear methods\ncould run by teaching a bilinear model in the train-\ning phase, and the bilinear model is evaluated in\nthe test phase. However, the answer information is\nstill inaccessible in the test set.\nTherefore, as shown in Figure 4, we introduce a\ntwo-stage workﬂow to make full use of the dataset.\nOur proposal is a universal simpliﬁcation process\nfor the FFOE VQA task, which gives full play to\nthe advantages of the bilinear and trilinear models.\nIn the ﬁrst stage, we train a bilinear model for\nthe questions and images ﬁrst, and then the top four\ncandidate answers are provided for each question\nbased on the output logits. Since the bilinear model\nperforms very high accuracy on the training set,\nthe candidate answers basically contain the correct\nanswer. In the test phase, the trilinear model is\nfully dependent on the candidates from the bilinear\nmodel.\nIn stage two, the candidates are ﬁrst restruc-\ntured into several image-question-answer pairs by\nreuse the input image and question; therefore, the\nnumber of the pairs is equal to that of the candi-\ndates. Then the trilinear model utilizes the image-\nquestion-answer pairs to choose a conﬁdent answer\nunder the MC VQA task setting (illustrated in Sec-\ntion 3.2), where the answer-question and answer-\nimage alignment information is learned.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 The Pre-training Strategy\nIn the hope of initializing our model effectively, we\npre-train our model with the masked language mod-\neling task, which is in a way similar to BERT (De-\nvlin et al., 2019). Since our model is trilinear, the\npre-training data format is triple of the question,\nimage, and correct answer. We utilize Visual7W,\nVQA-2.0, and TDIUC datasets (the training set) to\nDataset Model Acc-MC\nVisual7W\nMCB 62.2\nCTI 72.3\nMIRTT (Ours) 74.4\nVQA-1.0 MC\nDual-MFA 70.0\nMCB 70.1\nMFH 73.4\nMIRTT (Ours) 77.0\nTable 1: Comparison with the state-of-the-art results\non Visual7W and VQA-1.0.

In detail, We mask the tokens of\nquestions and answers with a probability of 15%.\nIn these masked tokens, 80% of them are replaced\nby sign [MASK], 10% of them are kept, and the\nother 10% are replaced with random tokens.\n4.2 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics\n4.2.1 MC VQA Tasks\nDataset. Visual7W is a subset of Visual\nGenome (Krishna et al., 2017). For each question-\nimage pair, there are four candidate answers, where\nonly one choice is correct. There are two tasks for\nVisual7W: pointing and telling, and we conduct our\nmethod on telling task. VQA-1.0 MC (Antol et al.,\n2015) is similar to Visual7W, while there are 18\ncandidate answers for each question.\nMetrics. Each question only has one correct\nanswer. Accuracy (Acc-MC) is used to measure\nthe performance (Zhu et al., 2016; Antol et al.,\n2015). We evaluate our methods on “test” split of\nVisual7W and “test-std” split of VQA-1.0 MC.\n2An example image-question pair from VQA-2.0\ndataset (Goyal et al., 2017)\n2285\nDataset Text extractor Bilinear method Bilinear result Trilinear result Ensemble result\nVQA-2.0\nGRU BAN2 66.5 65.5 68.9\nGRU SAN 63.0 65.0 66.8\nBERT MLP 59.5 64.3 65.5\nBERT ViLBERT 69.2 3 68.0 70.3\nTDIUC\nGRU BAN2 85.5 87.4 87.6\nGRU SAN 82.3 86.0 85.6\nBERT MLP 80.0 84.5 83.6\nGQA BERT BAN2 55.0 52.8 55.7\nBERT SAN 54.8 52.4 55.9\nTable 2: The results from test sets of VQA-2.0 and TDIUC.

VQA-2.0 is built from MSCOCO\ndataset (Lin et al., 2014). VQA-2.0 minimizes an-\nswer biases so that a language-only “blind” model\ncan not guess the right answers. TDIUC is a large\nVQA deadset of real images, which has over 1.6M\nquestions of 12 categories. GQA consists of 22M\nquestions, and each image corresponds to a scene\ngraph. The questions focus on visual reasoning and\ncompositional question answering.\nMetrics. In VQA-2.0, each question has ten\nhuman-generated answers. To present the inter-\nhuman variability, we deﬁne the accuracy-based\nevaluation metric (ACC) as follows (Wu et al.,\n2017):\nACC = min{n\n3 , 1} (7)\nwhere n is the frequency of the answer given by\nthe model in the answer set of the corresponding\nimage-question pair. In TDIUC and GQA, there is\nonly one right answer for each question. Therefore,\nnormal accuracy is used. For details, we evaluate\nour methods on “test-dev” split of VQA-2.0, “Valid”\nsplit of TDIUC, and “test-std” split of GQA.\n4.3 Implementation Details\nExcept for the referenced models and special in-\nstructions, we ﬁne-tune BERT as our text extrac-\ntor for questions and answers. And we freeze the\nFaster R-CNN detector (Anderson et al., 2018)\nwithout ﬁne-tuning as the image extractor. For\nimages, the maximum detected bounding box is\n3The result is not the same as in the cited paper. Regret-\ntably, after a lot of experiments, we still cannot reach the\naccuracy in the cited papers. Under the fair experimental envi-\nronment, the ensemble result outperforms the bilinear result.\nset to 50. For texts, the questions and answers are\ntrimmed to a sentence with a maximum length of\n12 tokens and 6 tokens, respectively.\nThe hyper-parameters of MIRTT follow the de-\nfault unless otherwise noted. The dimensions of\ninput images (dv), questions (dq) and answers (da)\nare 2048, 768 and 768. To simplify the calculation,\nwe reduce dv to 768 with a linear projection. For\nthe TrI-Att and Self-Att, the number of heads is 12,\nand the hidden dimension dh is 64.\nIn all experiments with a two-stage work-\nﬂow, we utilize six layers MIRTT with col-\nlection 2 (Table 3). Furthermore, our codes\nwill be made publicly available with instructions\nhttps://github.com/IIGROUP/MIRTT. More exper-\nimental settings can be found in the Appendix.\n4.4 MIRTT Performance on MC VQA\nAs shown in Table 1, we compare our methods\nwith previous methods on Visual7W telling task\nand VQA-1.0 multiple-choice task.\nMCB (Fukui et al., 2016): a method that consid-\ners FFT space to combine multimodal features.\nCTI (Do et al., 2019): a method that learns high-\nlevel associations between three inputs by using\nmultimodal-tensor-based decomposition.\nDual-MFA (Lu et al., 2018): a framework that\nfuses input embedding by selecting the free-form\nimage regions and detection boxes most related to\nthe input question.\nMFH (Yu et al., 2018): a framework that models\nboth the image attention and question attention\nsimultaneously.\nOur MIRTT with ﬁne-tuning (Table 3) improves\nthe CTI ACC-MC by 2.1% and improves the MFH\nACC-MC by 3.6%.\n2286\n4.5 MIRTT Performance on FFOE VQA\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the two-stage work-\nﬂow (Figure 4), we apply several bilinear methods\nas our backbones in stage one and set our MIRTT\nas trilinear methods in stage two. In detail, the\ncandidate answers lists are generated by baselines;\neach contains four answers.\nSAN (Yang et al., 2016): Stacked Attention Net-\nwork utilizes multiple attention layers by querying\nan image multiple times to infer the answer.\nBAN2 (Kim et al., 2018): Bilinear Attention\nNetwork fuses the question embeddings and image\nembeddings by utilizing co-attention.\nMLP: in this method, we use the ﬁrst output\ntoken embedding as the global representation of a\nquestion. Then, we sum up all object embeddings\nof an image after multiplying a learning weight\nfor each one. The global representations of the\nquestion and the image are then added and fed into\nan MLP layer for classiﬁcation.\nViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019) builds intra- and\ninter-relationship between vision and language\nbase on a pretrained transformer structure.\nEnsemble results : the predictions are calcu-\nlated by considering the outputs of stage one and\nstage two. The ensemble method normalizes the\ntwo results separately and adds them together. The\nﬁnal prediction is the candidate answer with the\nhighest probability.\nAs shown in Table 2, the trilinear results and en-\nsemble results outperform the bilinear results. Our\ntwo-stage workﬂow solves the problem that trilin-\near models are not able to be deployed in FFOE\nVQA. Furthermore, ensemble results show that bi-\nlinear models can utilize the answers after model-\ning the answer information by the trilinear models.\nIn particular, the GQA dataset is not introduced\nin pre-training data. Our two-stage workﬂow and\nMIRTT present better performances than the base-\nline methods, which shows the generalization capa-\nbility of our approaches.\n4.6 Ablation Studies\n4.6.1 The Components of MIRTT\nStacking layers and the size of pre-training\ndata. As shown in Table 3, MIRTT only needs\ntwo layers to signiﬁcantly outperform the others in\n“Random” based on accuracy.\nRandom: MIRTT is trained on Visual7W with-\nout pre-training.\nLayers Random Collection 1 Collection 2\n1 70.3 - -\n2 70.9 73.0 73.7\n4 70.4 73.3 74.2\n6 70.6 73.5 74.2\n8 70.3 73.5 74.4\nTable 3: The behaviors of the MIRTT with a different\nnumber of layers and different sizes of pre-training data\non the Visual7W dataset.\nCollection 1: MIRTT is pre-trained on the train\nsets of Visual7W and VQA-2.0.\nCollection 2: MIRTT is pre-trained on the train\nsets of Visual7W, VQA-2.0, and TDIUC.\nAfter pre-training, MIRTT outperforms the non-\npre-trained one in each layer from random and\ncollection 1. And as the number of layers increases,\nthe accuracy of MIRTT with collection 1 is im-\nproved. However, as the number of layers increases,\nthe capability of MIRTT with collection 1 seems\nto reach its limit at six layers, and growth hits a\nbottleneck.\nTherefore, we add one more dataset to pre-train\nMIRTT. Comparing with collection 1, MIRTT in\ncollection 2 can break the previously mentioned\nbottleneck and reaches the best score at the high-\nest layer with more pre-train data. Perhaps similar\nto ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), these attention-\nbased deep models are sensitive to dataset size.\nTherefore, the pre-trained MIRTT beneﬁts from a\nlarger number of parameters and more data, achiev-\ning an accuracy of 74.4%. Moreover, we conduct\nthe randomized Tukey HSD p-values and effect\nsizes based on one-way ANOV A (Sakai, 2018) to\nsupport statistical signiﬁcance of our results. De-\ntails are in the Appendix.\nAttention mechanisms. Since CTI does not con-\nsider the intra-modality information, we attempt\nto build some structures to enhance it. In the\nterm “CTI + Self-Att”, the original output of CTI\nis a joint representation, then make a fusion by\nadding text embeddings and the joint representa-\ntion. After that, we implement the Transformer’s\nencoders (Vaswani et al., 2017) with two layers.\nAs shown in Table 4, after adding self-attention to\nobtain ﬁne-grained information within the modal-\nity, the CTI is improved by 0.5% compared to the\noriginal model.\nBERT∗: We ﬁne-tune BERT on input questions\nand answers and fuse the extracted image embed-\n2287\n[Question]\nWhat is the main color of the train?\n[Answer list]\nBlue ❌\nYellow ❌\nRed ✔\nGold ❌\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 5: The visualization of the attention map M from Eq. 1.

In detail, we utilize the same operation\nof Bottom-Up and Top-Down (BUTD) (Anderson\net al., 2018) to fuse all representations.\nTo discuss two key components (“TrI-Att” and\n“Self-Att”), we utilize two layers of MIRTT without\npre-training as our basic structure. By replacing the\nsimple fusion methods like adding, we enhance the\ninput embeddings by considering the inter-modality\ninformation in TrI-Att. 5.1% improves the accuracy\nas a result. Considering CTI can beneﬁt from self-\nattention mechanism, we implement the Self-Att in\nour trilinear transformers. From the relative 0.4%\nimprovement, our MIRTT can also learn the intra-\nmodality information like “CTI + Self-Att”.\nVisualization for TrI-Att. Figure 5 visualizes\nthe behavior of MIRTT by showing detailed at-\ntention values of TrI-Att. The detected objects are\npresented with their numerical labels. The spe-\ncial tokens in questions and answers are provided\nby BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). For the image-\nquestion-(answer “Red”) pair, the correlation of\nobject “5” (the train) and token “Red” has a great\nattention value. Moreover, the model focuses on\nthe pair “5”-“train”-“Red”, which is helpful in rea-\nsoning that the train in the image is red. In terms\nof the answer “Gold”, the locomotive (object “2”)\ngains more attention than the object “2” in “Red”.\nTherefore, the answers could assist MIRTT in pre-\ndicting the correct choices.\n4.6.2 Cases for Two-stage Workﬂow\nFigure 6 describes some examples with applying\nour two-stage workﬂow (Figure 4). In detail, the\ntext extractors are all GRU, and the trilinear meth-\nods are MIRTT. The results show that our trilin-\near method is able to retrieve the most proper an-\nswer by utilizing the abundant information of the\nanswers. Whether the problem requires stronger\nreasoning skills in (a), or the ability to ﬁnd corre-\nspondences (images, questions, and answers) as in\n(b) and (c), MIRTT can handle it with a two-stage\nworkﬂow. Following different bilinear methods\nas backbones, the trilinear method might predict\ndifferent answers, such as (d).\n5 Conclusions\nWe introduced a trilinear interaction framework\ncalled MIRTT, which captures inter-modality and\nintra-modality information of images, questions,\nand answers. Our method is based on TrI-Att and\nSelf-Att mechanisms. The pre-trained model shows\nthe effectiveness among the baselines on several\ndatasets. Meanwhile, a two-stage workﬂow is intro-\nduced to apply the trilinear methods to FFOE VQA,\n2288\n(a) Q: What room are they \nlocated in?\noffice ❌\nclassroom ✔\n(b) Q: Are people cooking?\nyes ❌\nno ✔\n(d) Q: How many people are \nin this photo?\n6 ❌\n5 ❌\n(c) Q: What color is the \nglass covering the pilot?\nwhite ❌\nblue ✔\n[Bilinear Answer]\n[TrilinearAnswer]\n[Images]\n[Questions]\n[Bilinear Answer]\n[TrilinearAnswer]\nliving room ❌\nclassroom ✔\nyes ❌\nno ✔\nwhite ❌\nblue ✔\n5 ❌\n4 ✔\nBilinear \nBackbone\nBAN2\nSAN\nFigure 6: A collection of image-question-answer pairs by random selection from VQA-2.0 (Goyal et al., 2017).\nComparisons of whether to use two-stage workﬂow and different bilinear methods at the stage one in the test phase.\nshowing improvements on VQA-2.0, TDIUC and\nGQA.

Amount of data for pre-\ntraining datasets is shown in Table 5. Pre-training\ndataset collection 1 includes Visual7W (train/val)\nand VQA-2.0 (train/val). In VQA-2.0, there is a\nlist of human-generated answers to one question.\nWe treat the answer with the highest score as the\ncorrect answer. The size of the image-question-\nanswer pre-training collection is about 756k. In\ncollection 2, we add the train set of TDIUC to pre-\ntrain MIRTT. The size of pre-training tuples grows\nto 1.87M.\nB Implementation details\nThe whole details will be presented in our open-\nsource codes on Github. The Focal loss (Lin et al.,\n2017) is used for training the proposed models.\nPre-training. When we pre-train MIRTT, the\nbatch size is 128, and the initial learning rate is\n1e-4. We use the model of epoch 7 for later ﬁne-\ntuning.\nVisual7W. Batch size is set to 32 for all models.\nFor random initialization, the learning rate is 1e-4,\nand the number of the epoch is 17. For ﬁne-tuning,\nthe learning rate is 3e-5, and the number of the\nepoch is 11.\nVQA-1.0. Initial learning rate is set to 1e-4, and\nbatch size is 16. Since each question has 18 choices,\nthere are 288 samples in one batch.\nTwo-stage workﬂow. The settings of hyper-\nparameters of two-stage workﬂow are presented\nin Table 6. Stage one and stage two are separate,\nnot end-to-end structures. In stage one, the bilin-\near model is trained and we adopt a cross-entropy\nloss function to get the logits of the answers. Then,\nwe get the top four candidates based on the logits,\nwhich is the generated answer list. In stage two, we\nencode the answers and put those embeddings of\nthree modalities into MIRTT to get representations.\nWe put the pooled answer representations into a\nbinary classiﬁer and apply binary cross-entropy\nbased on labels generated from the FFOE dataset.\nThe number of candidate answers. To make our\nproposal a universal framework on both FFOE\nVQA and MC VQA tasks, we set the candidates to\nbe four Visual7W on VQA and RACE (Lai et al.,\n2017) on QA. We will do related explorations based\non this in the future. There are a few interesting\nproblems. For example, if the candidate answers\ndon’t include the correct answer, the trilinear model\nwon’t work for this question. However, this prob-\nlem is always possible unless the candidate list\nincludes all the answers, which is impossible. A\nlimited extension of the candidate list could help\nimprove the coverage of correct answers while con-\ntradicting our design’s universality.\nC P-value based on Randomized Tukey\nHSD tests\nTable 7, Table 8 and Table 9 show the statistical\nsigniﬁcance test results of the runs on Table 3.
