INTRODUCTION\nThe power transformer is one of the most important pieces\nof equipment in the power grid, and the failure of a power\ntransformer will affect the stable operation of a power grid,\nresulting in very large economic losses and even endanger-\ning people’s lives [1], [2]. On June 19, 2017, a transformer\nexplosion accident, which caused great economic losses, one\ndeath and seven passer-by injuries, occurred in Yongzhou\nCity, Hunan Province, China [3]. Thus, it is crucial to perform\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Hiram Ponce\n.\nfault diagnosis of power transformers quickly and accurately\nto ensure safe and stable operation [4].\nIn the ﬁeld of power transformer fault diagnosis, dissolved\ngas analysis (DGA) is the most versatile method [5]. There\nare several traditional DGA methods: the three-ratio method,\nRogers ratio method, and Duval triangle method [6]–[9].\nNevertheless, the above methods mostly rely on manual expe-\nrience and historical data. They encounter defects, such as\nincomplete coding and coding boundaries, so these methods\ncannot perform fault diagnosis of power transformers quickly\nand accurately. With the development of artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence, many new methods, such as artiﬁcial neural network\n(ANN) [10], [11], support vector machine (SVM) [12], [13],\n17268 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nand fuzzy theory [14], [15], have been proposed and applied\nin the ﬁeld of power transformer fault diagnosis.\nZhou et al.proposed a transformer fault diagnosis model\nbased on improved gray wolf optimization (IGWO) and\nprobabilistic neural network (PNN). Compared with the sim-\nulation results of eleven models, the stability of the pro-\nposed model was effectively proven, and the accuracy of\ntransformer fault diagnosis was improved signiﬁcantly. How-\never, the authors did not study the initialization of GWO.\nThe poor initial position of the population will affect the\noptimization performance. Therefore, only improving the\nupdate strategy cannot stably improve the GWO optimization\nperformance [16]. Kim et al. proposed a Semisupervised\nAutoencoder with an Auxiliary Task (SAAT) for power trans-\nformer fault diagnosis using DGA. The results show that the\nfault diagnosis method based on SAAT has good diagnos-\ntic performance. The proposed health feature space (HFS)\ncontributes to the intuitive monitoring of the health state of\ntransformers. The above methods only reﬂect the health of\ntransformers and cannot identify speciﬁc fault types, so the\nproposed method cannot be applied to accurate fault identi-\nﬁcation. [17]. Tahir et al.produced an intelligent monitoring\nand classiﬁcation algorithm for detecting transformer wind-\ning faults based on frequency response analysis (FRA). Then,\nfour cases were used to analyze the proposed method. The\nmodel can accurately identify various winding states in the\ntransformer. However, they did not study the disadvantage\nthat the parameters of ANN are difﬁcult to determine, and\nthe diagnostic accuracy of the proposed model cannot be\noptimized only by using ANN [18]. Yuan et al. proposed a\ntransformer fault diagnosis model based on chemical reac-\ntion optimization (CRO) and twin support vector machines\n(TWSVMs). The results show that the model not only ensures\nhigh simulation accuracy but also has fast diagnosis efﬁ-\nciency. However, CRO has the defects of precocity and poor\noptimization accuracy. They have not studied the above short-\ncomings, and the results have not been compared with recent\nresearch methods. Meanwhile, compared with the traditional\ndiagnosis model, the improvement of diagnostic accuracy of\nthe proposed model is not high [19].\nBy summarizing the above research methods from litera-\nture [10]–[20], ANN needs a large number of sample data,\nand the validity of the model is not strong, and the stability\nand robustness of fuzzy theory are poor, compared with ANN\nand fuzzy theory, SVM, which is suitable for nonlinear and\nsmall sample data, is not only more effective, and but also is\nmore widely used in the ﬁeld of fault diagnosis [20]. Thus,\nthis paper selects SVM as the basic model. SVM is a classiﬁ-\ncation algorithm with a perfect mathematical model based on\nstatistical learning theory. SVM has strong generalization, but\ndetermining parameters is still difﬁcult [21], [22]. Therefore,\nmany optimization algorithms, such as the whale optimiza-\ntion algorithm (WOA) [23], differential evolution (DE) [24],\nparticle swarm optimization (PSO) [25], and GWO [26], have\nbeen successively applied to SVM transformer fault diagnosis\nmodels to ﬁnd the optimal parameters.\nPower transformer fault diagnosis based on SVM has been\nstudied by many scholars at home and abroad. Zeng et al.\nproposed a transformer fault diagnosis model based on the\nIGWO-least squares SVM (LSSVM) model and used ker-\nnel principal component analysis (KPCA) to extract features\nfrom mixed DGA data. The results show that the model\nhas high diagnostic performance. Nevertheless, DE has some\ndefects, such as slow convergence and ease of falling into\nlocal optimization, and the authors did not research them.\nThus, the performance improvement in the diagnosis model\nis not distinct [27]. Li et al.proposed a transformer fault diag-\nnosis model based on an improved sparrow search algorithm\n(ISSA)-SVM, and the constructed model can accurately diag-\nnose transformer faults. However, the population diversity of\nSSA is poor, and traditional DGA data have noise, and the\nauthors have not further studied the above problems [28].\nBenmahamed et al. proposed a transformer fault diagnosis\nsystem using Gaussian classiﬁcation and bat algorithm (BA)\nto optimize SVM, and gas concentration and gas percentage\nwere used as two inputs to diagnose faults. The results show\nthat the diagnostic accuracy of BA-SVM reached 93.75%.\nHowever, the traditional BA, which easily falls into local\noptima, has poor population diversity, so it cannot ﬁnd the\noptimal parameters of the SVM. If the authors can study the\npopulation behavior to improve BA, the diagnostic perfor-\nmance of proposed model will be better [29]. Zhang et al.\nused a genetic algorithm (GA) combined with an SVM to\nbinary code the DGA feature quantity, and an improved krill\nalgorithm (IKH) was used to optimize the SVM parameters,\nthen, the fault diagnosis model based on IKHSVM. The\nresults show that the IKHSVM can improve the accuracy of\ntransformer fault diagnosis. However, the authors only added\nadaptive random disturbance to the krill population, and they\nshould also improve the initialization of the KH population,\nwhich can increase the optimization performance to improve\nthe stability of the diagnostic model [30].\nThree shortcomings of transformer fault diagnosis based\non SVM are summarized: 1) a single fault diagnosis model\ncannot greatly improve the fault diagnosis performance;\n2) the noise of transformer fault data will reduce the stability\nof the model; 3) research on optimization algorithms is not\ntargeted and cannot signiﬁcantly improve the optimization\nperformance. Thus, a transformer fault diagnosis method\nbased on the KPCA and TISOA-SVM method is proposed\nin this paper. It is noteworthy that the innovations and con-\ntributions of this paper are mainly divided into the follow-\ning four improved methods. First, KPCA is used to extract\nthe features of DGA data to reduce the inﬂuence of noise\non the diagnosis results. In addition, SOA can be improved by\nthe following three methods to obtain the TISOA. A modiﬁed\ntent map (MTent) is proposed to improve the initial diversity\nof the seagull population. Considering the inﬂuence of the\ninertia weight of SOA on population convergence and the\noptimization mode, a nonlinear inertia weight method, which\ncan effectively improve the convergence speed of the SOA,\nis proposed, and a random double helix foraging formula is\nVOLUME 10, 2022 17269\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nproposed to improve the optimization accuracy of the SOA.\nThen, it is noteworthy that TISOA can be obtained from the\nabove three improved methods, and the benchmark functions\nare used to test the optimization performance of TISOA and\nthe other six algorithms. The results show that TISOA has\nthe best optimization performance. Finally, three examples\nwere used to test the diagnostic performance of the proposed\nmethod. The results show that the proposed method has the\nhighest diagnostic accuracy, the shortest diagnosis time, the\nbest validity, and the strongest signiﬁcance. These results\ncan prove that the proposed method has the best diagnostic\nperformance.\nThe rest of this paper is as follows. Section II introduces\nthe basic theory of KPCA. Section III introduces the basic\ntheory of SVM and SOA and the improvement methods of\nSOA. Meanwhile, the optimization performance of TISOA\nis tested. In section IV, the diagnosis model proposed in\nthis paper is described. In section V, the diagnosis results\nare analyzed by three examples. In section VI, the research\nconclusions and shortcomings of this paper are summarized,\nand future research directions are proposed.\nII. BASIC THEORY OF KPCA\nKPCA is a feature extraction method based on principal com-\nponent analysis (PCA) [31]. KPCA solves the disadvantage\nthat PCA can extract only the features of linear data by\nintroducing a kernel function. KPCA extracts the features of\nnonlinear data and increases the dimensionality of the data\nby relying on a kernel function. The eigenvalues and eigen-\nvectors of the processed data are extracted, and the required\nprincipal components are obtained by PCA [32], [33]. And\nthe mathematical model is as follows and the ﬂow of data\nprocessing is shown in Figure 1.\nFor data sample xi(i =1,2,... m), by introducing non-\nlinear function ϕ(xi), the original sample data are mapped to\na high-dimensional space, and the covariance matrix (1) is\nconstructed.\nC =1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nϕ(xi)ϕ(xi)T (1)\nThrough feature analysis of Eq. (1), Eq. (2) is obtained.\nCV =λV (2)\nwhere λis the eigenvalue of C and V is the eigenvector of λ.\nV =\nN∑\ni=1\naiϕ(xi) (3)\nAn N-order matrix K is deﬁned as follows.\nKi,j =(ϕ(xi)ϕ(xj)) (4)\nEq. (5) can be obtained by combining Eqs. (2) and (3).\nNλa =Ka (5)\nThe above derivation is the case where the mean value\nof the mapping data is zero. However, most cases are not\nconsistent, and K will be effectively transformed.\nK =K −NK −KN +NKN (6)\nwhere N is an N-order matrix and N i,j is 1/N . Eq. (6) ensures\nthat the assumption that the mean value of the mapping data\nis 0 is true.\nIII. TISOA-SVM\nA. SVM\nSVM has a strong classiﬁcation ability [34]. The principle is\nto construct the optimal hyperplane in space and classify the\nsample data. The kernel function is used to map xi to the high-\ndimensional space ϕ(xi) to construct the optimal hyperplane.\nThe model is as follows:\nf (x) =sign(ωT ϕ(xi) +b) (7)\nwhere ω is weight vector; b is deviation. The relaxation\nvariable ξi is introduced to construct the maximum interval\nclassiﬁer. \n\n\n\nmin 1\n2 ∥ω∥2 +C\nN∑\ni=1\nξi\ns.t.yi(ωT xi +b) ≥1 −ξi\n(8)\nwhere ξi ≥0; C is a penalty factor that can balance ξi.\nThe Lagrange multiplier λi is introduced to turn the original\nproblem with constraints into a simple pair problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nmin 1\n2\nN∑\ni=1\nN∑\nj=1\nλiλjyiyjxT\ni xj −\nN∑\ni=1\nλi\ns.t.λi ≥0\n(9)\nThen, Eq.

(10) can\nobtain the best ω and b, which are brought into Eq. (7) to\nobtain the optimal decision model.\nf (x) =sign(\nN∑\ni=1\nλiyiK(xi,xj) +b) (11)\nwhere K(xi, xj) =ϕT (xi)ϕ(xj) is the kernel function. In this\npaper, the radial basis function (RBF) is selected as the kernel\nfunction of SVM and KPCA. RBF has only one parameter,\nand the performance of processing nonlinear data is good.\nThe expression is as follows:\nK(xi,xj) =exp\n{\n−\nxi −xj\n\n2\n2σ2\n}\n(12)\n17270 VOLUME 10, 2022\nY.

To establish the trans-\nformer fault diagnosis model, TISOA is used to ﬁnd the\nparameters C and σ, and KPCA is used to process the data.\nB. SOA\nSOA is a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm proposed\nby Gaurav Dhiman and Vijay Kumar in 2018 [35], [36].\nThe basic principle of SOA is to construct optimization rules\nby studying the migration and foraging behaviors of seagull\npopulations. Migratory behavior refers to the migration of\nseagull populations from one place of residence to the next;\nforaging behavior refers to the behavior of seagull population\npredation in their residence. The optimization strategy of\nSOA is as follows and the optimization process is shown in\nstep (a) of Figure 4.\n1) MIGRATION\nThe migration behavior of seagulls should meet three condi-\ntions, namely, avoiding collisions, moving toward the direc-\ntion of the best neighbor, and remaining close to the best\nsearch agent.\n1) Avoiding the collisions. To avoid collisions among seag-\null populations, variable A is used by SOA to adjust the\nposition of seagulls.\n− →CS =A ×− →PS (t) (13)\nwhere ⃗Cs represents a new location different from other seag-\nulls; ⃗Ps represents the current location of the seagull; and A\nrepresents the seagull’s movement behavior in a given search\nspace.\nA =fc −fc(t/Tmax) (14)\nwhere the value of fc is 2; t is the current number of iterations;\nand Tmax is the maximum number of iterations.\n2) Movement toward the best neighbor’s direction. After\nensuring that there was no collision between seagulls, all\nseagulls moved toward the best position.\n− →Ms =B ×(−−→\nPbest (t) −− →Ps (t)) (15)\nwhere − →\nMs indicates that the seagull population is moving\ntoward −−→\nPbest , the best positioned seagull. B is a random\nnumber and has the ability to explore balanced algorithm.\nB =2 ×A2 ×rand (16)\n3) Remain close to the best search agent. After calculating\nthe convergence direction of each seagull, the seagull begins\nto move.\n− →Ds =\n⏐⏐⏐− →Cs +− →Ms\n⏐⏐⏐ (17)\nwhere ⃗Ds represents the new position of the seagull after\nmoving.\n2) ATTACKING\nThe seagull population engage in foraging behavior accord-\ning to experience gained from migration behavior. The seag-\null population constantly changes its attack angles and ﬂight\nspeeds during migration. Seagulls spiral in the air to attack\nprey.\n\n\n\n\nx′=r ×cos(k)\ny′=r ×sin(k)\nz′=r ×k\nr =u ×ekv\n(18)\nwhere r is the helix radius, which is controlled by u and v,\nu and v are the correlation constants of the helix shape, and\nk is the random angle between [0, 2π ]. Combined with the\nnew location of seagulls, the location update formula of the\nseagull population is obtained.\n− →Ps (t) =(− →Ds ×x ×y ×z) +−−→Pbest (t) (19)\nwhere − →Ps (t) is the location of updated seagull population.\nC. IMPROVING METHODS OF SOA\nSOA has strong optimization performance. However, it still\nhas some defects. For example, it has poor location diversity\nof the initial population and easily becomes stuck in local\noptima. Aiming at the above shortcomings, this paper pro-\nposes the following three improvement methods to improve\nSOA: MTent, nonlinear inertia weight and the random double\nhelix foraging formula.\n1) MTENT\nThis paper uses a tent map to improve the defects of low\nergodicity and weak randomness of the initialized popu-\nlation of SOA. Tent map is a traditional chaotic mapping\nmethod [37].\nxn+1 =\n{\n2xn, xn ∈[0,0.5)\n2(1 −xn), xn ∈[0.5,1) (20)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 17271\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nFIGURE 2. Bifurcation diagram of MTent.\nFIGURE 3. Population initialization of Tent and MTent.\nHowever, the existence of small periodic points will make\nit jump out of the chaotic state [38]. For example, when the\ninitial value x0 ={0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}, there are small periodic\npoints. Furthermore, there are unstable periodic points, such\nas xn ={0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75} and xn =xn−i, i ={0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\nTherefore, MTent is used to replace the original initialization\nmethod of SOA to enhance the population diversity. The\nformula is as follows:\nxn+1 =\n{\n2(xn +rand()/20), xn ∈[0,0.5)\n2(1 −(xn +rand()/20)), xn ∈[0.5,1] (21)\nIn Eq. (21), rand() is a random number between [0, 1].\nWhen the chaotic sequence is generated, xn will jump out\nof the periodic point and enter a chaotic state again because\nthe random disturbance formula rand()/20. The bifurcation\ndiagram of MTent is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 3 shows the population distribution in (0,1) space\ngenerated by MTent and Tent. With MTent, seagulls can jump\nout of the boundary due to the random disturbance formula,\nand all seagulls that jump out of the boundary are counted as\nbeing on the boundary.\nAs shown in Figure 3, by comparing two methods, the\nresults can be seen that most of the populations generated\nby the tent map are clustered at the boundary and have poor\nergodicity and randomness. In contrast, the initial population\ngenerated by MTent has stronger ergodicity and randomness,\nand the generated population has better diversity.\nFIGURE 4. Inertia weight curve.\n2) NONLINEAR INERTIA WEIGHT\nMigration behavior is an important part of the optimization\nstrategy of SOA. Inertia weight A plays a key role in the\nprocess of migration behavior. The size of A, which can\navoid the collision of seagulls during migration, will affect\nthe global search behavior of SOA.\nIn this section, a nonlinear formula is proposed to improve\nthe inertia weight A of the SOA to make the seagull pop-\nulation behavior update more ﬂexible and to increase the\noptimization efﬁciency.\nA =2 ·cos(π\n2 ·x +π\n2 ) +2 (22)\nThe cosine function in Eq. (22), which can make the atten-\nuation of the inertia weight smoother, is selected to replace\nEq. (14). Figure 4 shows the function image of the inertia\nweight before and after improvement.\nAs shown in Figure 4, when the iteration ratio of the\nimproved inertia weight reaches 0.33, the value of A is equal\nto 1 and decays slowly in the subsequent iteration. The pop-\nulation starts a local search to ensure that the optimization\naccuracy and optimization efﬁciency of the SOA are effec-\ntively improved.\n3) THE RANDOM DOUBLE HELIX FORAGING FORMULA\nIn this paper, the foraging behavior of SOA is studied and\ninspired by the bubble-net attacking method of WOA. A dou-\nble helix formula with randomness is proposed to improve\nthe foraging formula of SOA. The basic theory of WOA is as\nfollows.\na: WOA\nThe WOA is a metaheuristic algorithm to simulate the pre-\ndation behavior of humpback whales and was proposed in\n2016 by Mirjalili [39]. WOA has the advantages of a simple\nstructure and few adjustment parameters.\ni) ENCIRCLING PREY\nAll whales in the population swim near the optimal whale in\nthe population, causing the whale population to conduct local\noptimization.\n17272 VOLUME 10, 2022\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nii) SEARCH FOR PREY\nThe whales randomly select a whale in the population and\nswim near it to conduct global optimization. The location\nupdate formula is as follows:\nB =a ·(2 ·rand −1) (23)\nC =2 ·rand (24)\nD =|C ·Xrand −X| (25)\nX(t +1) =Xrand −B ·D (26)\nwhere a is a linear function that decreases from 2 to 0 mono-\ntonically.\niii) BUBBLE-NET ATTACKING METHOD\nBubble-net predation is used to surround the prey by simulat-\ning the predation behavior of humpback whales. The location\nupdate formula is as follows:\nX(t +1) =\n{\nD ·ebl ·cos (2πl)+X, p ≥0.5\nX −B ·D, p <0.5 (27)\nwhere b is a constant that deﬁnes the shape of the spiral;\nl is a random number between [−1, 1]; and p is a random\nnumber between [0, 1]. When p <0.5, WOA surrounds prey\nor searches prey. When p ≥0.5, WOA carries out bubble-net\nattacking.\nb: THE RANDOM DOUBLE HELIX FORAGING FORMULA\nThe variable parameter A in WOA is introduced to control\nthe search state, the seagull position is randomly changed\nin the SOA iteration process, and the control parameter p is\nintroduced to control the optimization method. When |A|>\n1 and the control parameter is p <0.5, SOA will conduct a\nrandom search.\n− →D =\n⏐⏐⏐− →C ·−−→Xrand −− →Ps (t)\n⏐⏐⏐ (28)\n− →Ps (t +1) =−−→Xrand −B ·− →D (29)\nwhere − →Ds represents the new position of the seagull after it\nhas moved and −−→Xrand represents a random seagull in a seagull\npopulation. Finally, the double helix formula is constructed\nby combining Eq. (27)\n− →Ps (t +1)=\n{− →Ds ·ebl ·cos (2πl)+−−→Pbest (t), p ≥0.5\n(− →Ds ×x ×y ×z) +−−→\nPbest (t), p <0.5\n(30)\nWhen |A|> 1, the formula of p < 0.5 is replaced with\nEq. (29). In this paper, the double helix with randomness in\nEqs. (29) and (30) is used to improve the foraging behavior\nof SOA in Eq. (19), the diversity of the seagull population is\nincreased, and the optimization accuracy of SOA is improved.\nD. TISOA\n1) SUMMARY OF IMPROVEMENT METHODS\nThe improved method proposed in Part C of Section III is\nused to improve SOA from three aspects to obtain TISOA,\nFIGURE 5. Optimization flow chart of TISOA.\nthe corresponding improvement objectives are shown in step\n(b) of Figure 4.\n1) MTent is used to initialize the seagull population, which\ncan replace the original random initialization of SOA,\nand it can increase the diversity of the seagull population\nand greatly enhance ergodicity and randomness.\n2) Under the condition of good population diversity, the\ninertia weight A is improved obtain the improve formula\n(22). The method is increasing its attenuation speed to 1,\nreduce the migration behavior of the seagull population,\nand increase the foraging behavior of the seagull popu-\nlation.\n3) To greatly improve the optimization accuracy of SOA,\nbased on the previous two improvements, a double helix\nformula with randomness is proposed to improve the for-\naging behavior of SOA to replace the original attacking.\nSigniﬁcantly, this is an innovative improvement method,\nwhich can comprehensively improve the convergence\nspeed and optimization accuracy of SOA.\nTo verify the validity and superiority of these three\nimproved methods, the benchmark functions have been used\nto test the optimization performance of TISOA in Part E of\nSection III.\n2) OPTIMIZATION PROCESS OF TISOA\nIn this section, the optimization process of TISOA is intro-\nduced in detail, and Figure 5 is the speciﬁc ﬂow chart.\nStep 1: parameter initialization. Initialize the algorithm\nparameters of the SOA and WOA, and set the pop-\nulation size M, the maximum number of iterations\nT , the dimension dim, Fc, A, a, l and B;\nVOLUME 10, 2022 17273\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nFIGURE 6. Benchmark test functions.\nTABLE 1. Parameters of algorithms.\n Step 2: population initialization. MTent is used to initialize\nthe seagull population and randomly generate the\nindividual seagull population;\nStep 3: ﬁtness calculation. The initial ﬁtness values of the\nseagull population and the individuals are calculated\nand compared to ﬁnd the optimal individual;\nStep 4: migration behavior. SOA performs the migration\nbehavior using Eqs. (13), (15) and (17). Then, the\nlinear inertia weight A (Eq. (14)) which controls the\nmotion behavior, is replaced by Eq. (22);\nStep 5: foraging behavior. The double helix with random-\nness in Eqs. (29) and (30) is used instead of the\noriginal foraging behavior in Eq. (19); SOA exhibits\nforaging behavior with strong randomness and high\naccuracy, and B is Eq. (23);\nStep 6: population selection. After the SOA iteration, pop-\nulation selection is carried out, and the popula-\ntion positions and individual positions with the\nbest ﬁtness are taken as the next generation ﬁtness\nvalues;\n17274 VOLUME 10, 2022\nY.

If yes, the algorithm ends; otherwise, go to\nstep 4.\nE. OPTIMIZATION PERFORMANCE TEST OF TISOA\nIn this paper, 24 benchmark functions are used to test the\noptimization performance of TISOA, GWO, PSO, sailed\nﬁsh optimizer (SFO), WOA, SOA, and ISOA. The bench-\nmark functions are unimodal benchmark test functions,\nmultimodal benchmark test functions, ﬁxed-dimension mul-\ntimodal benchmark test functions, and CEC2015 benchmark\nfunctions. ISOA improves the nonlinear inertia weight and\ndouble helix formula with fault diagnosis.\nThe parameters of the above algorithms are shown\nin Table 1. All tests in this paper are realized in\nMATLAB 2020a. The operating environment is Intel (R) core\n(TM) i7–9700 CUP, 16.0 GB memory and 64-bit operating\nsystem. All algorithms are tested 20 times.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 17275\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nTABLE 2. The benchmark functions test results.\n1) TRADITIONAL BENCHMARK FUNCTION\nIn this section, nine benchmark functions are selected to\ntest the above algorithms, including three unimodal func-\ntions F1, F2 and F3; three multimodal functions F4, F5 and\nF6; and three ﬁxed dimensional multimodal functions F7,\nF8 and F9. The speciﬁc formula is shown in Appendix 1.\nFigure 6 is a three-dimensional graph of nine benchmark\nfunctions. Table 2 shows the simulation results of seven algo-\nrithms, in which the best value (Best), average value (Ave),\nand standard deviation (Std) of the ﬁtness values are recorded\nas evaluation items.\nIn Table 1, the best value, average value and standard\ndeviation of the function test results are in bold. For unimodal\nbenchmark test functions F1, F2 and F3, the test results of\nTISOA are better than the results of the other algorithms,\nin which the found optimal ﬁtness value is 95 orders of mag-\nnitude higher than that of the traditional SOA and dozens of\norders of magnitude higher than those of the other algorithms,\nand the performance of TISOA is obviously better than that of\nthe other algorithms. From the results of multimodal bench-\nmark test functions F4, F5 and F6, it can be concluded that\nthe results of ISOA and TISOA are the best compared with\nthe results of the other algorithms, but TISOA, ISOA, GWO,\nand WOA can ﬁnd the minimum ﬁtness value in F4 and F6.\nIn the ﬁxed-dimension multimodal benchmark test function\nF7, the three evaluation terms obtained by TISOA are the best;\nin F8 and F9, GWO, WOA, SOA and TISOA can ﬁnd the best\nevaluation items.\nFrom the test results for the above benchmark functions,\ncompared with other algorithms, the three evaluation items\nobtained from the TISOA test are optimal, which is enough\nto prove that TISOA has strong optimization performance and\nstability. However, there are also several benchmark func-\ntions in which TISOA and other algorithms can ﬁnd optimal\nresults.\nTherefore, the speciﬁc test results are shown in Figure 7 to\nfurther compare and analyze the optimization performance\nof these algorithms. For unimodal benchmark test func-\ntions F1, F2 and F3, compared with the other algorithms,\nTISOA not only ﬁnds the optimal value of the function\nbut also improves the convergence speed. For F3, TISOA\nﬁnds the optimal value only when it reaches 100 itera-\ntions. For multimodal benchmark test functions F4, F5 and\nF6, TISOA and ISOA can stably ﬁnd the minimum values\nof the functions, GWO and SOA also have the ability to\nﬁnd the minimum values of the functions, and the conver-\ngence speed of TISOA is signiﬁcantly higher than the other\nalgorithms.\nFor F4 and F6, TISOA converges quickly at the beginning\nof iteration and ﬁnds the minimum ﬁtness values. For the\nﬁxed-dimension multimodal test functions F7 and F9, TISOA\nhas the fastest convergence speed, and the minimum values of\n17276 VOLUME 10, 2022\nY.

Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nTABLE 4. Fault data.\nthe functions can also be found. For F8, TISOA has signiﬁ-\ncantly improved the convergence speed compared with SOA\nand ISOA.\n2) CEC2015\nThe CEC2015 benchmark functions are used to further verify\nthe optimization performance of TISOA. All algorithms are\ntested 20 times, and the average (Ave) and standard deviation\n(Std) were taken as the evaluation items. The speciﬁc function\nformula is shown in Appendix 2, and the results are shown in\nTable 3.\nThe boldface text in Table 3 is the best item of the test\nresults. It can be clearly seen that the results of TISOA for\nthese functions are the best. Among the CEC-9, CEC-12 and\nCEC-13 benchmark functions, the average values of several\noptimization algorithms are close, but the TISOA standard\ndeviation is smaller and the optimization stability is stronger.\nFor other functions, the average value and standard deviations\nof TISOA are the minimum, and TISOA has better optimiza-\ntion performance than other traditional algorithms, which can\neffectively prove the remarkable optimization performance of\nTISOA.\nIV. POWER TRANSFORMER TROUBLESHOOTING BASED\nON KPCA AND TISOA-SVM\nIn this section, a power transformer fault diagnosis method\nbased on KPCA and TISOA-SVM is described in detail as\nfollows.\nA. DATA PROCESSING BASED ON KPCA\nThe DGA data used in this paper are 300 sets of DGA data\nobtained from the Hubei Power Grid in China, and some data\nare given in Table 4.\nTABLE 5. Fault type number.\nFIGURE 8. Principal component contribution rate.\nTABLE 6. Principal component extraction results.\nThere are ﬁve characteristic quantities in the existing DGA\ndata, namely, H2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 and C2H2. There are six\nfault types: medium- and low-temperature overheating (T 1),\nhigh-temperature overheating (T 2), partial discharge (PD),\nlow-energy discharge (D 1), high-energy discharge (D 2) and\nnormal state (NC). The fault types are numbered, as shown in\nTable 5.\nKPCA is used to extract features from the existing data.\nFirst, the DGA data are divided into test sets and training sets.\nTwo hundred groups of data are selected as the training sets,\nand 100 groups of data are selected as the test sets. The rela-\ntionship between the principal component contribution rate\nand eigenvalue (Lambda) is shown in Figure 8 and Table 6,\nin which the core width in KPCA is selected as 8.\nIn this paper, the principal component contribution rate is\n95%, so the ﬁrst four principal components are extracted as\nfault diagnosis data. Table 7 shows some of the extracted data.\nBecause the sample size corresponding to each fault type\nin the data are different, 30 groups of data are selected\n17278 VOLUME 10, 2022\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nTABLE 7. Partial extraction results.\nTABLE 8. Data grouping.\nTABLE 9. Diagnosis result of new models.\nfor each fault type, and a total of 180 groups of data are\nselected for fault diagnosis. The groupings of the training set\nand test set of data are shown in Table 8 and have a ratio\nof 2:1.\nB. DATA NORMALIZATION\nDue to the different sizes and high complexity of the existing\nfault data features, it is necessary to normalize the data after\nKPCA feature extraction and to map all data into (0, 1).\nx∗\ni = xi −xmin\nxmax −xmin\n(31)\nwhere i = 1,2,3,4; x∗\ni represents normalized data; xmin\nrepresents the minimum value in data; xmax represents the\nmaximum value in data; xi represents raw data.\nFIGURE 9. Fault diagnosis flowchart.\nC. THE PROCESS OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS\nThis section elaborates the speciﬁc ﬂow of power trans-\nformer fault diagnosis based on KPCA and TISOA-SVM, and\nFigure 9 is the speciﬁc ﬂow chart.\n1) Feature extraction. KPCA is used to extract the features\nof DGA data, and the principal components are extracted\nas fault data according to the total contribution rate of the\nprincipal components, which is 95%;\n2) Data preprocessing. The extracted fault data are loaded;\nthe training sets includes 120 groups, and the test sets\nincludes 60 groups. The data are normalized to (0,1);\n3) Parameter optimization. TISOA is used to optimize the\nparameters C and σof the SVM. The speciﬁc optimiza-\ntion process is described in Part C of Section III;\n4) Judgement of whether the termination conditions are\nmet. If the optimization algorithm reaches the maximum\nnumber of iterations, then the optimization is stopped\nand the optimal parameters are output; otherwise, the\noptimization process continues;\n5) Result output. After obtaining the optimal parameters C\nand σ, SVM starts fault diagnosis and outputs the results,\nincluding the algorithm running time, fault classiﬁca-\ntion, test set accuracy, training set accuracy, and number\nof misclassiﬁcations.\nV. EXAMPLE DIAGNOSIS RESULTS\nThe method based on TISOA-SVM to diagnose the faults\nwith the KPCA-processed DGA data in this paper. Further-\nmore, three examples are compared and analyzed to verify the\nsuperiority of the proposed diagnosis method. The parameter\nVOLUME 10, 2022 17279\nY.

Result of fitness curve.\nsettings of the algorithms used in all methods are shown\nin Table 1, and Tmax =100; Population =30; ub =103;\nlb =10−3.\nA. EXAMPLE 1\nFirstly, TISOA-SVM is used to diagnose the data before and\nafter KPCA processing to verify the validity of KPCA in data\nprocessing, Table 9 and ﬁgure 10 show the diagnostic results.\nThe results show that the diagnostic accuracy of pro-\nposed method is 96.67%, with 2 misjudgments, and the\nFIGURE 11. Diagnosis results of four methods.\ndiagnostic accuracy of TISOA-SVM is 91.67%, with 5 mis-\njudgments; The diagnostic time of proposed method is\n17280 VOLUME 10, 2022\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nFIGURE 12. Fitness curves of five methods.\n7.037s, and diagnostic time of TISOA-SVM is 8.762s. It can\nbe seen that TISOA-SVM is used to diagnosis the DGA data\nwhich are processed by KPCA can obtain the higher accuracy\nand shorter time than diagnosis original DGA data. The above\nresults prove that the DGA data processed by KPCA is more\neffective in fault diagnosis.\nSigniﬁcantly, in order to carry out the diagnosis test more\neffectively and intuitively, all the following fault diagnosis\ntests are based on the DGA data processed by KPCA.\nThen, the performance of TISOA-SVM is prelimi-\nnary tested, the fault diagnostic results of GWO-SVM,\nWOA-SVM, SOA-SVM and SFO-SVM are compared with\ndiagnostic result of KPCA-TISOA-SVM. And the diagnos-\ntic results include diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic time and\nﬁtness curve. The speciﬁc diagnostic results are shown in\nFigure 11 and Table 10.\nBy analyzing the results in Figure 11 and Table 10, the\nfault diagnosis accuracy of GWO-SVM is 90%, with 6 mis-\njudgments; the fault diagnosis accuracy of WOA-SVM is\n90%, with 6 misjudgments; the fault diagnosis accuracy of\nSOA-SVM is 88.33%, with 7 misjudgments; and the fault\ndiagnosis accuracy of SFO-SVM is 88.33%, with 7 misjudg-\nments. It can be seen that diagnostic accuracy of proposed\nmethod is approximately 5% higher than other methods, and\nit has 4-5 fewer misjudgments. The proposed method is sig-\nniﬁcantly better than four models and the diagnostic accuracy\nhas great improvement.\nThen, the diagnostic time of ﬁve methods is given for fur-\nther analysis. It can be seen that the result of proposed method\nis 7.037s, which is fastest compared with above methods.\nThus, it can be concluded that proposed method has higher\ndiagnostic efﬁciency than above methods.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 17281\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nFinally, as shown in Figure 12 and Table 11, ﬁtness curves\nare given to compare the convergence performance of the\nproposed method.\nAs shown in Figure 12 and Table 11, the optimal ﬁtness\ncurve of TISOA-SVM converges fastest, which converges\nwhen iterating to the 3th generation, and the ﬁtness value\nfound is the highest. In addition, the average ﬁtness curve\nconverges of proposed method when it iterated to 50 gen-\nerations, with the increase in the number of iterations, the\naverage ﬁtness also approaches the optimal ﬁtness. A higher\nﬁtness value can be found with GWO-SVM, and it starts\nto converge during the 22th generation. The optimal ﬁtness\ncurve of WOA-SVM converges when it is iterated to 17th\ngenerations. A faster convergence speed can be found with\nSOA-SVM, it starts to converge during the 5th generation, but\nthe ﬁtness value is not high. And the optimal ﬁtness curve of\nSFO-SVM converges when it is iterated to 3th generations\nand it has the lowest ﬁtness value in ﬁve methods. It is\nworth noting that except for the proposed method, the average\nﬁtness curves of other methods all do not converge to the\noptimal ﬁtness values.\nIn summary, the proposed method has the best performance\nthan other methods in diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic time,\nand ﬁtness curves.\nMeanwhile, in order to prove the diagnostic performance\nof the proposed method more convincingly, ﬁve methods\nfrom the others in the literature are given to diagnostic the\nfault of KPCA data in Example 2, and the results are com-\npared with the proposed method.\nB. EXAMPLE 2\nIn the section, the diagnostic results of ﬁve methods will\ncompared with the proposed method. These methods are\nIGWO-SVM [8], IGWO-PNN [16], HGWO-LSSVM [27],\nBA-SVM [29], and IKH-SVM [30].\nFirstly, Figure 13 and Table 12 show the diagnostic accu-\nracy and time of these methods.\nThe results show that the fault diagnosis accuracy of\nIGWO-SVM is 93.33%, with 4 misjudgments; the fault diag-\nnosis accuracy of IGWO-PNN is 93.33%, with 4 misjudg-\nments; the fault diagnosis accuracy of HGWO-LSSVM is\n91.67%, with 5 misjudgments; the fault diagnosis accuracy\nof BA-SVM is 90%, with 6 misjudgments; and the fault diag-\nnosis accuracy of IKH-SVM is 95%, with 3 misjudgments.\nAmong them, IKH-SVM has the highest diagnostic accuracy,\nbut it also lower than the proposed method.\nThen, diagnostic time of six methods is analyzed Because\nthe model of PNN has high complexity, so the diagnostic\ntime of IGWO-PNN is the slowest of the other methods,\nwith 21.013s. The same improve methods were used in\nIGWO-SVM and HGWO-SVM, but these methods reduce\nthe complexity of diagnostic model, because the diagnos-\ntic time of IGWO-SVM is not reduce. However, LSSVM\nhas lower complexity than SVM, so the diagnostic time of\nHGWO-LSSVM has a litter lower than IGWO-SVM. The\nFIGURE 13. Diagnosis results of four methods.\n17282 VOLUME 10, 2022\nY. Wuet al.: Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method-Based Hybrid Improved SOA\nTABLE 12. Diagnosis result of six methods.\nTABLE 13. p-value of wilcoxon rank sum test.\ndiagnostic time of BA-SVM and IKH-SVM is 11.467s and\n8.182s respectively. It can be concluded that the proposed\nmethod is the fastest than other methods.\nC. EXAMPLE 3\nIn this section, statistical test is used to judge about the\nsuperiority of the proposed method. 20 times results of six\nmethods are tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test to obtain\np-value. That is, whether the proposed method is signiﬁcantly\ndifferent from other methods under the standard of p =0.05.\nWhen p > 0.05, it can be considered that the assumption\nof H0 is accepted, there is no signiﬁcant difference between\nthe two methods, and the diagnostic ability of the methods\nis the same; When p < 0.05, H0 is rejected, that is, there\nis a signiﬁcant difference between the two methods. And\nTable 13 shows the results.\nThe results show that the tested p-value are all far less than\n0.05, so the conclusion can be obtained that the proposed\nmethod has stronger signiﬁcance than other methods.\nThen, A single test set does not prove the validity of the\nmethod. So, 3-fold cross-Validation is used to verify the\nvalidity of the proposed method. Table 14 shows results of\nall methods.\nIt can be seen that the result of IGWO-PNN is 4% less\nthan that of single test set because the model of PNN has low\nstability. And compared with other methods, the proposed\nmethod has the highest accuracy.\nTABLE 14. 3-fold cross-validation of all methods.\nIn this section, the signiﬁcance and validity of proposed\nmethod are proved. Meanwhile, summarizing the results of\nsection A, B, and C, it can be concluded that the proposed\nmethod has the best diagnostic performance compared with\nother methods.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis paper advances a new power transformer fault diagnosis\nmethod based on the SVM. First, KPCA is used to extract the\nfeatures of DGA data. Then, aiming at the defects of SOA,\nthree improved methods are proposed: improved tent chaos\ninitialization, nonlinear inertia weight, and the stochastic\ndouble helix formula. Finally, a transformer fault diagnosis\nmethod based on KPCA and TISOA-SVM is constructed, and\nthree examples are used to test its diagnostic performance.\nSigniﬁcantly, the following conclusions are obtained:\n1) The traditional benchmark functions and CEC2015\nbenchmark functions are used to simulate TISOA and\nsix optimization algorithms. The results show that\nTISOA has the highest optimization accuracy and fastest\nconvergence speed. The results of these functions effec-\ntively prove that TISOA has excellent optimization per-\nformance, which can optimize SVM parameters quickly\nand accurately.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 17283\nY.

Compared with other\nmethod, the diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic time\nof proposed method have been greatly improved, and\nthe signiﬁcance and validity of the method is also the\nstrongest.\nIn conclusion, the fault diagnosis method proposed in this\npaper has excellent diagnostic performance, can diagnose\ntransformer faults quickly and accurately, and has high ref-\nerence values. However, the research on DGA data in this\npaper is not comprehensive. In the future, DGA data will be\ndeeply analyzed and studied to further improve the accuracy\nand stability of transformer fault diagnosis.\nAPPENDIX A\nSee Table 15.\nAPPENDIX B\nSee Table 16.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.
