  "abstract": "High-frequency current transformer (HFCT) sensors are widely used for partial discharge detection due to their versatility, high sensitivity, and wide bandwidth. This paper reports on a finite-element analysis (FEA) methodology that can be employed to optimize HFCT performance. The FEA model consists of accurate 3D representations of the sensor components. Two different FEA software modules were used in order to cover the wide operating frequency range of the sensor. The simulation computes the frequency response of the sensor in the range 0.3-50 MHz for various HFCT geometric and material parameters, specifically the number of winding turns, spacer thickness, aperture size, and core material. A prototype HFCT was constructed and the measured response compared with that of the simulation. The shapes of the responses were similar, with the simulated sensitivity being higher than the measured sensitivity by 1 dB on average. The measured low-frequency cutoff of the sensor was found to be only 0.05 MHz lower than that of the simulation.",
