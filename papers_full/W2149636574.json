INTRODUCTION\nT\nHE RESEARCH on low-power radio technology is moti-\nvated by the needs from several application areas. Among\nthese application areas are distributed wireless sensor networks,\nwhich may include chemical security monitoring [1], buried\nsensors for buildings and structure health [2], biotelemetry [3],\n[4], or surveillance in logisticchains [5]. These types of net-\nworks are sometimes referred to as Internet of Things (IoT),\nubiquitous computing, or simply as radio-frequency identiﬁca-\ntion (RFID). A common requirement is the need for ultra low\npower receiver solutions. The network node lifetime is deter-\nmined by its power consumption and its battery capacity. En-\nergy scavenging from mechanicalvibrations, thermal gradients,\nor electromagnetic ﬁelds could increase the lifetime or elimi-\nnate the need for batteries. Exclusion of batteries may drasti-\ncally change the service required to maintain the network, but\nwith available radio technology this will also severely reduce\nthe communication range for the nodes. A common accepted dc\npower consumption level where energy scavenging is feasible\nfor a node is around 100\nW[ 6 ] .\nManuscript received August 15, 2012; revised October 26, 2012, December\n27, 2012; accepted January 01, 2013.

Svensson is with the Department o f Electrical Engineering (ISY),\nLinköping University, SE-58183 Linköping, Sweden (e-mail: christer@isy.liu.\nse).\nDigital Object Identiﬁer 10.1109/JETCAS.2013.2242777\nTwo different network extremes can be deﬁned, the event\ndriven network and the Wake-Up driven network. The event\ndriven network active power is set by the power consumption\nof the sensor (computational power included). Here, it is the\nsensor which activates the communication sessions [7] at prede-\nﬁned events. In Wake-Up driven networks, the communication\nsessions are initiated over the air interface, and it is the radio re-\nceiver active-power that sets the power consumption [8]. Note\nthat for a Wake-Up radio it is not the powerrequired transfer-\nring one bit of information being important, but rather the ac-\ntive power neededto continuously be aware. The Wake-Up net-\nwork is typically based on one central reader and several “slave”\nnodes, where the dedicated master is supplied with “unlimited”\npower.\nWirelessly powered sensor networks have gained lot of in-\nterest being independent from external energy sources other\nthan the transmitted radio energy. These systems are often lim-\nited in range by the power scavenge efﬁciency rather than by\nthe receiver sensitivity [2], [9]–[11]. By reducing the needed\nreceiver power consumption both the range and time to wake\nup would improve.\nDuty cycling of the receiver is a straight forward solution\nto reduce average powerconsumption but lead to longer wake\nup time and a need for a good clock to time the rendezvous.\nFurther, the clock has to be stable over temperature and time, or\nit has to periodically perform costly calibration sequences [12],\n[13]. Different medium access control (MAC) protocols have\nalso been proposedin cross-level design efforts to relax clock\naccuracy requirements and improve overall network efﬁciency,\nand thereby increase network lifetime [14], [15].\nSeveral propose d Wake-Up solutions are based on ex-\nternal detecting devices, such as Schottky diodes [16]–[18].\nA successful Wake-Up radio solution has to be low cost and\npreferably work as an intellectual property (IP) block to be in-\ncluded in several applications. This implies a single chip design\nin a commercially available complementary metal–oxide–semi-\nconductor (CMOS) process, and a use of low-cost materials\n[8]. Further, the design needs to be robust in terms of process\nparameters variations, as well as environment variations and\nradio interference [19]–[21]. Among the proposed receiver ar-\nchitectures for Wake-Up radios weﬁnd the super regenerative\nreceiver. This architecture use positive feedback to increase\ngain atradio frequencies to reach a better sensitivity. Although\nthe super regenerator is suitable for efﬁcient energy per bit\ncommunication at high speeds, itsactive power makes it inef-\nﬁcient as a pure Wake-Up receiver [22]–[24]. A better suited,\nand previously used, receiver architecture is the tuned RF\nreceiver (see Fig. 1). The tuned RF receiver performs envelope\n2156-3357/$31.00 © 2013 IEEE\n6 IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 3, NO. 1, MARCH 2013\nFig. 1. Tuned RF receiver. The dashed line surrounds functional blocks being\nimplemented as an external transmission line voltage transformer in this work.\ndetection at the carrier frequency without any prior frequency\nconversion. Thus, energy consuming local oscillators and\nmixers are avoided, but at the cost of sensitivity and selectivity.\nIn the tuned RF receiver selectivity is instead enabled by a\npreceding RF-ﬁlter. The receiver in this paper is a tuned RF\nreceiver without any oscillators, neither in the RF chain nor in\nthe baseband stages. No external components are used, except\nfor a transmission line voltage transformer on a FR4 laminate\ncarrying the RF-ASIC. The transformer works both as an RF\nﬁlter and as an impedance transformer, increasing the output\nvoltage at a given input power.\nII. O\nSCILLATOR FREE ARCHITECTURE\nThe Wake-Up radio has the single purpose to recognize a pre-\ndetermined ID-code bit pattern in the air and the chosen archi-\ntecture is focused on simplicity. It uses no oscillators, and no\ncontrol or calibration loops asphased locked loops or super re-\ngenerative solutions. This enables short startup time and avoid-\nance of lock-in processes adding to overall power consumption\n[25].\nAs much as possible of the radio functionality should be\nhandled over to the interrogator or reader (the term “reader”\nemanates from the RFID community and is a bit misleading\nhere since we only use downlink communication). A very small\namount of data will be sent at each wake up session, only a few\nhundred bits long ID-code. We use on–off keying modulation\nof the carrier; although this is spectral inefﬁcient it is motivated\nby the short transmission bursts and the simpliﬁcation of the\nreceiver design. A carrier frequency of 2450 MHz (ISM) offers\na good compromise between size and range, and an ability to\nsee “around” obstacles.\nA. Envelope Detection\nThe incoming RF carrier drives a diode, or other rectifying\ncomponent. The envelope detector self mixing efﬁciency falls\noff as the carrier power decrease. Thus, the sensitivity for a\ntuned RF receiver is moderate compared to the super heterodyne\nwith a mixer always being driven by a strong LO signal. How-\never, the typical applications for the Wake-Up receivers requires\nonly rather short transmission range, up to about 10 m [22]. A\nreduction in active power achieved by excluding the local oscil-\nlator is well motivated.\nThe envelope detector folds the modulated spectrum around\nthe carrier\ndown to baseband frequency (see Fig. 2). The\nFig. 2. Envelope detection.\nbaseband output voltage from the envelope detector is pro-\nportional to the square of the input amplitude of the RF carrier\n(1)\nA subthreshold biased MOST envelope detector as described in\n[20] will have a noise current limiting its output signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) and its sensitivity. From [20] we get\n(2)\nHere, is transistor transconductance, is available thermal\nenergy, with being transistor ideality factor and\nthe unit charge, and is detector bandwidth. It is clear that\nboosting with a pre-ampliﬁer in front of the detector would\nimprove the sensitivity drastically. It is worth to note that it is\nthe carrier amplitude that is important, rather than carrier power,\nand that voltage ampliﬁcation can be achieved passively by a\ntransformer. The input impedance of a MOST detector is, for\nnarrow band transformation, so high that the achievable trans-\nformation ratio or transformer output impedance\n, is setting\nthe performance. The transformer output voltage amplitude at\nan available input power is found by\n(3)\nThe maximum achievable output impedance depends on tech-\nnology parameter limitations and losses. It is difﬁcult to get ef-\nﬁcient voltage transformation with on-chip inductors, the large\ninductances needed would occupy large die area and have too\nlow resonant frequencies. Lumped off-chip inductors would add\nto the component count cost and occupy valuable bonding pad\nresources for terminals. Further, the transmission lines and bond\nwires used to connect the inductor have to be taken into ac-\ncount during design, and they prove to be difﬁcult to control.\nDistributed passive transformer may be a simple way to get\naround the problem without adding components. HighQ-values\nare available with modern laminate materials, even a low cost\nmaterial as FR4 will sufﬁce.\nThe output from the detector is ampliﬁed to ensure safe\nswitching in a digitizer. As the detector output at weak input\ncarrier levels fall of very quickly the baseband processing\nmust be designed for low noise performance. A low baseband\nbandwidth enables subthreshold biased transistors to be used in\nthe design and ensure low power consumption.\nAn expression for the total noiseﬁgure of a tuned RF receiver\nis given in [8]\n(4)\nNILSSON AND SVENSSON: ULTRA LOW POWER WAKE-UP RADIO USING ENVELOPE DETECTOR AND TRANSMISSION LINE VOLTAGE TRANSFORMER 7\nHere, and is the noiseﬁgure and voltage gain, respec-\ntively, of the preampliﬁer, is low-frequency noise at the\noutput of the preampliﬁer, and is the conversion gain and\nlinear transfer function respectively of the detector, is the\noutput noise from the envelope detector, andﬁnally, is the\nnoise power of the source resistance. Both noiseﬁgure\nand low frequency noise of our passive voltage transformer\nwill be very small compared to the envelope detector noise con-\ntribution. Thus, we may simplify (4) to\n(5)\nWith a given minimum acceptable the minimum de-\ntectable power sensitivity of the receiver may now be calculated\nby\n(6)\nUsing (2) together with the targeted parameters of this work,\ndB, mV , kHz, and with a\ndetector current A( u s i n g ), the sensi-\ntivity may be calculated to about 3.2 mV. Corresponding signal\npower for the calculated sensitivity voltage depend on voltage\ntransformer efﬁciency and ratio. When detector noise dominates\nthe noise budget of the receiver, as in this work, it is beneﬁcial\nto reach for a higher voltage transformer ratio, corresponding to\na larger transformer output impedance. With a transformer input\nimpedance of 50\nand an output impedance of 2000,t h es e n -\nsitivity will be about dBm, while an output impedance of\n300 results in about dBm.\nB. ID Code Correlation\nThe baseband digital signal processing requires a baseband\nclock. Although this clock will run at a signiﬁcant lower fre-\nquency than the local oscillator it will consume energy, and re-\nquire external resonating elements such as crystals, or capaci-\ntors, and a periodical re-synchronization such as a phase locked\nloop. The baseband clock can instead be embedded in the trans-\nmitted data. If no phase locked loop or otherﬂywheel function\nis included the clock must be transferred together with each data\nbit. Manchester coding enables this by coding each ID-code bit\nwith a transition; the bit value “1” is coded with a “01”-tran-\nsition, and bit value “0” is coded with a “10”-transition [26].\nThe cost is a doubled edge rate but the gain is, again, a simpli-\nﬁed design. The actual bandwidth of the baseband signal is not\nincreased but shifted upwards, reducing the impact of 1/f-noise\n[27]. Thus, the baseband signal will be dc-free and the baseband\ncircuitry would not need to have any dc-gain.\nA self-clocked correlator (see Fig. 3), compares the received\ndata with the stored ID. Data would be shifted in to a shift reg-\nister by the recovered clock encoded in the Manchester data. A\nshort preamble bit pattern is used to trigger the clock recovery\ncircuit and to start the correlation. This would reduce the ac-\ntivity of the digital logic and save spending of dynamic energy.\nA hardware implementation of the demodulator can be made\nwith low power building blocks,where the only always aware\nFig. 3. Self-clocked correlator block diagram.\nFig. 4. RF voltage transformer metal pattern layout on 0.508-mm-thick FR4.\npart is the clock recovery circuit. It can be designed for very\nlow power, and would consist of an edge detector followed by\na monostable multivibrator and pulse shaping inverters. We be-\nlieve that the analog parts of the receiver will dominate the com-\nplete receiver power budget.\nThe length of the ID-code typically is around 100 bits. The\nEPC transponder Class 1 use 96 bits for its ID [28]. After Man-\nchester encoding and addition of preamble the result is around\n200 bits to transfer over the air interface. One thousand units\nmay be addressed within 1 s with a bit rate of 200 kb/s.\nIII. C\nIRCUIT DESIGN\nA test chip was designed with an envelope detector, a base-\nband ampliﬁer, and a buffer ampliﬁer. An RF voltage trans-\nformer was placed on the FR4 printed circuit board (PCB) car-\nrying the die. The receiver was designed for 1 V bias to enable\na low power design. For the same purpose all devices are oper-\nating in moderate or weak inversion.\nA. RF Voltage Transformer\nThe matching network was designed for a 0.508-mm-thick\nFR4 laminate (see Figs. 4 and 5), and consists of a 50-\ntrans-\nmission line leading to a single stub combined with a transmis-\nsion line. Further, a bias network (not depicted in Figs. 4 or 5)\nfor biasing of the detector via the RF input pad was attached to\nthe transformer.\nA narrow band circuit model of the transformer and antenna\nis seen in Fig. 6. The antenna impedance\nas seen from\nthe detector input through the matching circuit may be mod-\nelled as a source resistance\nin parallel with an inductance\n. The equivalent source resistance is about k\n8 IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 3, NO. 1, MARCH 2013\nFig. 5.

Looking into the de-\ntector (from the chip input pad) we see the pad capacitance (in-\ncluding electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection), the transistor\ngate capacitance, and bias resistor in parallel ( and\n). Placed between the detector input and the matching net-\nwork is the bonding wire . If we now look into the de-\ntector through the bond wire, view a) in Fig. 6, the detector\nimpedance\nis transformed downwards. The equiv-\nalent loading in this case is 13.5 kin parallel with 421 fF. The\ntank circuit formed by equivalent inductor and the loading\ncapacitance of 421 fF has a resonance frequency of 2.5 GHz.\nThe circuit simulation of the design was veriﬁed with mo-\nmentum EM simulations in ADS. Momentum EM simulations\ntake into account metal losses, dielectric losses, and unintended\ncoupling between circuit elements. Minor tuning was needed\nto reach performance. Aﬁnal design of the matching network\nincluded biasing network, detector transistor, pad, and ESD\nloading capacitance.\nB. Envelope Detector\nThe detector is depicted in Fig. 7 [20]. NMOS transistor M1\nis the rectifying component and NMOS transistor, M2, is a con-\nstant current bias source. The bias current is set to 1\nAb y\nkeeping m V .M 1i sd r i v e ni ns u b t h r e s h o l dr e g i o n\nfor an efﬁcient nonlinear response. An on-chip resistor could be\nused to connect the gate of M1 to VDD, but we chose to bias\nthe gate of M1 via the RF input pad for greaterﬂexibility. Since\nbias current is kept stable by M2, the drain-source bias voltage\nover M1 will decrease for strong input signals.\nBroad band input impedance of the detector depend on the\ngate capacitance, but in our case the total capacitive load from\nthe input pad and the ESD protection diodes dominate. The size\nFig. 7. Envelope detector.\nof M1 is set by a complicated tradeoff between output ampli-\ntude, power consumption, noise, and RF bandwidth. A large\ntransistor can handle a larger current, and still be in subthreshold\nregion, leading to stronger output amplitude. While a small tran-\nsistor load the transformer with less capacitance, leading to a\nhigher potential transformation ratio. Power consumption re-\nstricts the upper bound of the size of M1, while 1/f-noise re-\nstricts the lower bound on the size of both M1 and M2. The\noutput capacitor\nacts as bypass for the RF signal to ground\nand as a lowpassﬁlter together with the output resistance .\nOutput resistance of the detector is\n(7)\nwhere is the transconductance of M1 and is the channel\nconductance of M2. The detector output current charge theﬁlter\ncapacitor and the voltage will vary along with the modulation\nsignal. We use a dc-free Manchester coded baseband signal and\nfurther ﬁltering will take place in the baseband ampliﬁer. The\noutput capacitor should be kept small (1 pF) to save expensive\ndie area. DC levelﬂuctuations from the detector are blocked out\nfrom the baseband ampliﬁer by a dc-block capacitor.\nC. Baseband Ampliﬁer\nThe resulting baseband signal voltage over the output capac-\nitance must be ampliﬁed and further ﬁltered for secure level\nswitching at the digitizer. Th i si sp e r f o r m e db yt w oa m p l iﬁer\nstages connected in series (seeFig. 8). The stages are based on\ndifferential feedback cascode stages. Each stage ampliﬁes about\n30 dB (see Fig. 9) and they are not optimized for linearity. The\noutput voltage dc-level from the last stage can be controlled by\nand may in turn control the bias point of a following digi-\ntizer.\nThe detector signal is very weak and we do not want the\nbaseband ampliﬁer to dominate the noise budget. Therefore,\nthe baseband ampliﬁers have to be designed for low noise\nperformance. The largest noise contributor is the input tran-\nsistor M1 of the ﬁrst ampliﬁer stage. The noise voltage is\n,w h e r eis the noise coefﬁcient of the\ntransistor, and is the bandwidth. The goal is to have a SNR\nbetter than 10 dB, the smallest estimated amplitude from the\nenvelope detector is\nmV and the bandwidth is\nNILSSON AND SVENSSON: ULTRA LOW POWER WAKE-UP RADIO USING ENVELOPE DETECTOR AND TRANSMISSION LINE VOLTAGE TRANSFORMER 9\nFig. 8.

The lowest acceptable of M1 can be found\nby\n(8)\n(9)\nThis transconductance give us the lowest acceptable bias current\nof the ampliﬁer.\nOur design is optimized for a bit rate of 200 kb/s.

The resistor i ss e tt o6 5M, and is im-\nplemented with a subthreshold biased MOST using the channel\nresistance. The channel resistivity has an exponential depen-\ndence to the gate voltage and the gate bias needs effective de-\ncoupling for low noise performance.\nThe lowest frequency component in the Manchester coded\nbaseband signal is\n, and with\nkb/s over the air we get kHz. The highest frequency\nthrough the baseband ampliﬁer is\nkHz, where we keep the third overtone for sharper transitions in\nthe bit stream.\nFig. 10. Die photograph of WuR mounted on FR4 carrier substrate.\nFor simplicity reasons, we did not include bias circuitry in\nthe present design. The bias circuitry for the baseband ampliﬁer\nneeds to be carefully designedto limit the impact of process and\ntemperature variations. Still, we expect a relatively low sensi-\ntivity to variations, as we can have a dc blocker at the output\nand as the frequency characteristic is not very steep.\nD. Buffer Ampliﬁer\nA source follower ampliﬁer was added to the design as buffer\nfor measurement purposes. The buffer ampliﬁer adds no voltage\ngain to signal but is capable to drive larger currents and iso-\nlates the baseband ampliﬁer from the capacitive and resistive\nloading of the bonding pad and measurement equipment. The\nbuffer was biased with\nV and use double oxide gate\nthickness transistors. The buffer ampliﬁer has a 3-dB bandwidth\nof 7 MHz.\nIV . MEASUREMENT RESULTS\nThe receiver was fabricated in a 130-nm CMOS process with\nMIM capacitors. No external components are used other than an\netched transformer in the FR4 carrier PCB. The integrated cir-\ncuitry (see Fig. 10) isﬁtted within an area of around 7000\nm\nand is hence suited to be used as an IP-block being placed in\na die corner, or near the die edge, of a general ASIC. The total\ncurrent consumption of the detector and baseband ampliﬁer is\n2.3\nA.\nDemodulation of the baseband signal is realized in MATLAB\nfor bit error rate (BER) measurement. Baseband sampling fre-\nquency is 800 kHz and data is processed in sequences with a\nlength of\nbits. For better precision several sequences are\nused. After being digitized the signal is normalized between 0\nand 1 and passed to a Schmitt-trigger. A following monostable\nmultivibrator secures a pulse-width of four samples.\nA. Input Matching\nThe input matching of the Wake-Up of radio was measured at\nthe transformer input terminal (see Fig. 11). Compared to sim-\nulations the frequency response was shifted 67 MHz upwards.\n10 IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 3, NO. 1, MARCH 2013\nFig. 11. Upper: Measured (cross) and simulated (circle) input matching with\ntransformer and bias network. Lower: Comparison of simulations of RF-trans-\nformer standing alone (triangle) and RF-transformer including the bias network\nimplemented on the experimental FR4 andused during measurements (circle).\nFig. 12. Measured BER at MHz.\nThe shift is probably caused by errors in the model of the input\npad capacitance and the bond wire inductance.\nThe spurious response at 3.75 GHz is a result of the external\nbias network attached to the transformer (see Fig. 11). No sig-\nniﬁcant sensitivity was measured at 3.75 GHz. The return loss\nof\ndB is somewhat high, but will not affect the sensitivity as\nthe detector is voltage sensitive rather than power sensitive.\nFig. 13. Measured sensitivity bandwidth.\nFig. 14.

Sensitivity\nReceiver sensitivity was measured with a 2450 MHz carrier\nsignal modulated with 100% ASK (see Fig. 12). The RF band-\nwidth is found in Fig. 13, where the lowest input power resulting\nNILSSON AND SVENSSON: ULTRA LOW POWER WAKE-UP RADIO USING ENVELOPE DETECTOR AND TRANSMISSION LINE VOLTAGE TRANSFORMER 11\nTABLE I\nCOMPARISON OF RECENT PUBLISHED IMPLEMENTED LOW POWER RADIOS\nin has been plotted against the carrier frequency.\nThe best sensitivity, dBm, is found at\nMHz, corresponding well to the best matching response from\nthe transformer.\nSlow variations in amplitude and dc-level at the output of\nthe baseband ampliﬁer have been measured and veriﬁed by\nsimulations. The ampliﬁer is designed for ultra low power\nand low noise, but must not load the detector output with too\nlow impedance. This limits the size of the input transistor and\nthereby the 1/f-noise performance of the ampliﬁer [29].\nC. Interference Immunity\nImmunity to interfering radio signals is important for\nWake-Up radios. The proposed design is very resilient to\nsources with a modulation sp ectrum outside the baseband\nampliﬁer bandwidth. Further, the use of a passive transformer\nfor voltage ampli ﬁcation makes the design robust against\nsaturation and signal intermodulation caused by any overdrive\nof active components. A continuous wave blocker signal with a\nlevel of\ndBm only 1 MHz below the carrier frequency did\nnot swamp the sensitivity of the radio. During these measure-\nments the modulated carrier signal, at 2450 MHz, wasﬁxed\nat a power 3 dB above the required level for a\nwithout interference.\nThe result from the same set up, but with a modulated blocker,\nis presented in Fig. 14. Two different baseband signals were\nused to modulate the blocker, a 50-kHz and a 90-kHz square\nwave, respectively. As long as the modulated interferer power\nwas roughly 6 dB below the sensitivity limit level the Wake-Up\nradio was not blocked.\nA particularly important blocker is a WLAN signal, also uti-\nlizing the ISM band. We, therefore, tested the effect of a WLAN\nsignal, simulated as a 64QAM modulated signal with 5-MHz\nbandwidth (see Fig. 15). We note that for WLAN signal we\ncan accept up to\ndBm blocker power without loss of sensi-\ntivity (except when the blocker is located within 2.5 MHz from\nthe wanted carrier). The reason is that the baseband ampliﬁer\ncatches only a limited part of the 5-MHz WLAN spectrum, so\nnot only the RF selectivity butalso the baseband selectivity\nhelps to suppress blockers.\nV. D\nISCUSSION\nThe present design aims at very low power consumption\nat acceptable sensitivity for a continuously aware wake-up\nreceiver. We therefore chosen an architecture based on an\nenvelope detector and a passive RF voltage gain, limiting the\nsensitivity to about\ndBm [20].\nAiming for a better sensitivity would require higher voltage\ntransformation ratio, higher detector transconductance (and cur-\nrent consumption), or the addition of an LNA between the trans-\nformer and the detector (also increasing current consumption).\nHigher voltage transformation ratio is difﬁcult to achieve due\nto limitations set by transformer manufacturing and materials.\nHigher detector transconductance is very expensive in power\nconsumption, as the transconductance needed is proportional to\nthe inverse square of power sensitivity [see (2)] and the current\nconsumption is proportional to the transconductance. The ad-\ndition of an LNA between the voltage transformer and the de-\ntector can be expected to improve the sensitivity with limited\npower consumption increase but at the cost of lower immunity\nto blockers (brieﬂyd i s c u s s e di n[ 2 0 ] ) .\nIn Table I we compare the present design with recently pub-\nlished implemented designs with power consumption below 400\nW. This comparison is not perfect; in some cases (including\nthe present one), the digital power consumption is not included,\nand in others it is included. Still, we believe that the combina-\ntion of\ndBm sensitivity and 2.3W power consumption is\nthe best achieved until date. Designs with better sensitivity all\nconsume more than 20 times the power of the present one.\nVI. C\nONCLUSION\nIn [20] we estimate the reachable sensitivity of a detector con-\nsuming 1 W to be approximately dBm. This estimate was\nbased on a detector interfaced with a high impedance antenna\nand without baseband ampliﬁer. Measurements and simulations\nindicate that, with present basicbaseband signal processing, the\nsensitivity is actually\ndBm, limited by 1/f-noise in the base-\nband ampliﬁer. With an extendedﬁltering a sensitivity better\nthan dBm should be possible. However, our primary goal\nhere is to show the possibilities with a simple and robust oscil-\nlator-free Wake-Up radio. The proposed design offers a robust\nand trim-free solution easily implemented in a ordinary CMOS\nprocess without adding any external lumped components.\nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank J.
