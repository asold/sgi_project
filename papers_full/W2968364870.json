How Tool-Use Shapes Body Metrics\nINTRODUCTION\nActing with tools is a familiar aspect of everyday life. People\nuse tools for eating cakes, moving logs, picking up leaves, and\nwriting papers. A characterizing feature of tools is that they\noften make out-of-reach objects reachable and manipulable.\nThere is a lot of evidence that using a rake-like tool exerts a\ndeep impact on the agent’s space representation, enlarging her\nown reaching space according to the range of tool action. It\nhas been demonstrated that tools are treated by the nervous\nsystem as sensory extensions of the body rather than as simple\ndistal links between the hand and the environment (Miller et al.,\n2018). A seminal study by Iriki et al. (1996) on non-human\nprimates showed that a repeatedly used small rake expanded the\nreceptive fields of parietal visuo-tactile neurons to encompass\nthe space around both the hand and the rake. If the monkey\nheld the rake without using it, the receptive fields shrank back\nto their usual extension. Analogous results have been obtained\nin both healthy and brain-damaged humans. For instance,\nstudies on healthy subjects showed that tool-use might increase\nthe impact of far visual distracters on tactile discrimination\n(Maravita et al., 2002; Holmes et al., 2004) as well as the\nsensitivity to the affording features of out-of-reach objects\n(Costantini et al., 2011). Similarly, studies on patients with visuo-\ntactile extinction indicated that the severity of their extinction\ncould be modified by using tools, which extend the reach of\nhand actions (Farnè and Làdavas, 2000; Maravita et al., 2001;\nFarnè et al., 2005). In the same vein, patients with neglect\nonly for the hemispace close to their body have been found to\nworsen their performance in a line bisection task in the far space\nwhen using a tool like a long stick (Berti and Frassinetti, 2000;\nNeppi-Mòdona et al., 2007).\nStrikingly, tool-use has also been reported to affect the agent’s\nbody representation (Martel et al., 2016). For instance, it has been\nshown that tool-use might alter the kinematic profile of forearm\nmovements in a reach to grasp task. Even more interestingly,\ntool-use has been found to modify body metric representation\n(Cardinali et al., 2009a). Sposito et al. (2010) took advantage of\nan arm bisection paradigm (Bolognini et al., 2012; Tosi et al.,\n2018), by asking participants to estimate the subjective midpoint\nof their own forearm before and after a training phase with long\n(60 cm) and small (20 cm) tools (Sposito et al., 2012). The results\nshowed that participants indicated a more distal midpoint, thus\nexhibiting an increased representation of the length of the arm\nhandling the tool, after long-tool-use training only. Indeed, using\nsmall tools did not alter participants’ body metric representation.\nMore recently, Romano et al. (2019) have investigated how\ndifferent actions with a tool may impact the subjective metric\nrepresentation of the body. They found a proximal shift in the\nperceived midpoint when the training phase with tool mostly\ninvolved proximal movements (e.g., shoulders), while a distal\nshift occurred after the training phase asking for a large use of\nproximal movements (wrist and fingers).\nThere is a mounting consensus that the representation of the\nbody is similar to the representation of the surrounding space\nwith respect to its being action-oriented (Maravita and Iriki,\n2004). In a nutshell, this means that body representation is not\nonly sensory but also motor in nature, and it is for this reason\nthat actions may shape how the body is represented (Gallese and\nSinigaglia, 2010). Acting with tools makes this point vivid. As\nthe aforementioned studies indicate, tool actions can alter agents’\nbody metric representation, with this effect being related both to\nwhich tool is used and how it is used. However, postulating a\nlink between body and action allows two different and (partially\natleast) alternative views on how tool actions may shape the way\nin which the body is represented.\nAccording to a first view, the shaping would rely on the\nmere motor execution of tool actions. Some evidence speaks for\nthis first view, albeit indirectly. For instance, it has been shown\nthat tools have to be effectively used to reach far objects, since\njust holding them (Iriki et al., 1996; Farnè and Làdavas, 2000;\nMaravita et al., 2001; Serino et al., 2007) is not enough to alter\nspace representation (Serino, 2019). It seems therefore natural to\nassume that something similar holds for body representation. But\nthis assumption could be disputed by a second view, according to\nwhich the possibility for tool action to shape body representation\nwould primarily depend on the coexistence between goal\nrepresentation and bodily movements. According to this view,\nin order for the tool-use to shape the body representation, goals\nand motor programs have to be represented to intentionally\naccomplish tool actions. There is some evidence supporting\nthis second view. For instance, it has been shown that imaging\nacting with tools is sufficient to modify one’s own arm’s length\nrepresentation (Baccarini et al., 2014). Furthermore, Garbarini\net al. (2015a) reported the case of brain-damaged hemiplegic\npatients who manifested a pathological embodiment of other\npeople body parts (Fossataro et al., 2016, 2018b; Ronga et al.,\n2019). The patients were asked to estimate the midpoint of their\nparalyzed forearm before and after a training phase in which an\nexperimenter repeatedly used a tool, being aligned or misaligned\nrelative to patients’ shoulders. When the experimenter was\naligned, the patients were (delusionally) believing to perform\nthe tool-use training with their own paralyzed arm. This\ninduced a significant modulation of the perceived arm length.\nIndeed, the patients located their forearm midpoint more distally\n(i.e., close to the hand) in the post- than in the pre-training\nphase. No effect occurred when they were misaligned to the\nexperimenter during the training phase (Garbarini et al., 2015a).\nOther evidence supporting the second view comes from two\nstudies of Cardinali and colleagues in healthy subjects. In a\nfirst study (Cardinali et al., 2009b), when investigating the\ndifferential role played by the morpho-functional characteristics\nof a tool and the sensorimotor constraints that a tool imposes\non the hand, they found that tool-use induces a rapid update\nof the hand representation in the brain, not only on the\nbasis of the morpho-functional characteristics of the tool\nbut also depending on the specific sensorimotor constraints\nthat each tool imposes to the user’s motor program. In a\nsecond study (Cardinali et al., 2012), when assessing functional\nagainst non-functional tool-use with respect to the effects on\nbody representations, they found that the same tool, used for\ndifferent tasks (i.e., a grabber to grasp object or a grabber\nto perform a perceptual task), differently affects arm length\nrepresentation, depending on how it is used. This suggests that\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 September 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 299\nBruno et al. How Tool-Use Shapes Body Metrics\nour perceived body metrics is differently modulated, according\nto the way in which specific goals and motor programs of a tool\naction are represented.\nThe main aim of the present study is to specifically investigate\nhow tool action may shape body representation, by contrasting\nthese two views. In doing this, we need a pair of situations\nthat differ in that one involves the representation of the tool\naction goals and motor programs, whereas the other does\nnot. To create such a pair of situations, we adapted the arm\nbisection paradigm used by Sposito et al. (2012) and Garbarini\net al. (2015a), by contrasting a condition in which there is a\ncoexistence between action goals to be accomplished and bodily\nmovements (i.e., active tool-use training) with a condition in\nwhich the tool-use training was produced without representing\na corresponding action goal (i.e., passive tool-use training by\nmeans of robotic assistance). The comparison between active\nand passive movements has been previously used to dissociate\nthe representational component of the movement from the mere\ndisplacement of our body in space, by using different techniques\nsuch as hand-twitches induced by single-pulse transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation (e.g., Bolognini et al., 2016; Bruno et al.,\n2017) and limb mobilization induced by mechanical device\n(e.g., Bisio et al., 2017; Fossataro et al., 2018a) and by the\nexperimenter during ischemic nerve block (Christensen et al.,\n2007) or during resting condition (Garbarini et al., 2015b).\nUpper limb movements have been studied in healthy people and\nsubjects with neurological conditions also by taking advantage\nof robotic arms, since they are able to produce different force\nfields aimed at enhancing the subject’s residual motor control\nor at imposing highly controlled, reliable, and repeatable passive\nmovements (Patton and Mussa-Ivaldi, 2004; Carpinella et al.,\n2009, 2012; Pan et al., 2011; Casadio et al., 2015; Cardis et al.,\n2018). Irrespective of the techniques employed, the common\nfeature of the passive movement is the lack of the intentional\ncomponent and, therefore, the consequent absence of motor\nrepresentation. Indeed, during passive movements, subjects do\nnot have to represent the goal of the action in order to voluntarily\nproduce it, but their actions only depend on externally\ngenerated forces.\nIf tool actions may shape the body representation by virtue\nof their effective production (first view), no differences in the\nsubjective metric estimation of the body after active and passive\ntraining should be expected. On the contrary, if the body metric\nrepresentation primarily depends on whether, during tool-use,\nthe action programs and goals are motorically represented rather\nthan merely produced (second view), we would expect to find a\nsignificant increase of the perceived forearm length in the post-\nwith respect to the pre-training phase after the active training\nphase only.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants\nTwelve healthy participants (five females; mean age ± SD:\n24.3 ± 1.4) took part in the study. The sample size was based\non our previous study exploring the modulation of the right arm\nbody metric representation after tool-use training (i.e.,N = 10;\nin Garbarini et al., 2015a). A similar sample (N = 11) was used\nin the original article of Sposito et al. (2012). Therefore, in the\npresent study, 12 participants were recruited in order to obtain\na sample of at least 10 participants showing the modulation of\nthe right arm body metric representation after tool-use training\n(see details in ‘‘Experimental Paradigm’’ section). All participants\nwere right-handed (Oldfield, 1971) and naïve to the purpose\nof the experiment. None of them had history or evidence of\nneurological, psychiatric, or other relevant medical problems.\nParticipants gave informed written consent. The study was\napproved by the Ethics Committee of the Don Carlo Gnocchi\nFoundation IRCCS (session 2014-12-10) and conforms to the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nExperimental Paradigm\nThe experimental paradigm is shown inFigure 1. Participants\nperformed a forearm bisection task (for more details, see the\nnext section) immediately before and after 20 min of tool-use\ntraining. The tool-use training was performed by means of the\nplanar robot for the upper limb shown inFigure 2 (Braccio di\nFerro, Celin, Italy; Casadio et al., 2006), which was equipped\nwith a customized handle. The handle connected the robotic\narm to a tool consisting of a 120-cm wooden rod with a\nU-shape extremity (i.e., the rake). The opposite extremity of\nthe tool was fixed to participants’ right forearm through a\nbondage to prolong their arm. After preparation, participants,\nsitting in a comfortable position with both forearms on a\ntable, underwent the tool-use training involving the repeated\nexecution of ‘‘enfold-and-push’’ movements. In particular, for\neach repetition, one of three cubic objects (green, yellow, and\nred cubes with a side of 3.5 cm) was placed on the table by\nthe operator in random order at a distance of 120 cm from\nanterior torso along participants’ midsagittal plane. Therefore,\nthe object had to be ‘‘enfolded’’ by the participants using\nthe U-shaped extremity of the tool and smoothly pushed to\nthe target area with the same color as the moved cube (see\nFigure 1). This robotic version of motor training is functionally\nsimilar to the ‘‘grasp-and-place’’ task previously employed in\nprevious studies (Garbarini et al., 2015a; Romano et al., 2019).\nThe three target areas were placed at a distance of 20 cm\nfrom the starting position respectively at 60◦, 90◦, and 120◦\nfrom the horizontal to cover a significant part of the reaching\nspace. Each participant performed the tool-use training in two\ndifferent sessions, separated by a week: active and passive. In\nboth sessions, participants were asked to execute the ‘‘enfold-\nand-push’’ task for 20 min. In the active session, the robot did\nnot provide any force toward the target area and the subjects\nactively performed the movements. During the passive session,\nperformed after a week, the robot generated an assistive force\nthat moved the tool (and consequently the forearm) towards the\ntarget area. The assistive force was implementedad hocin order\nto impose to the robotic handle a minimum-jerk trajectory that\nis typical of reaching movements naturally executed by healthy\nsubjects in real-life contexts (Flash and Hogan, 1985). In the\npassive session, the participants were asked to relax as much\nas possible and to let the robot move their arm without any\nactive intervention.

Each\nparticipant performed the forearm bisection task immediately before and after\n20 min of tool-use training in two different sessions, separated by a week:\nactive session (upper part) and passive session (lower part).

In the passive session, only\nparticipants (N = 10, 5 females; mean age± SD: 24.4 ± 1.2,\naccording to the sample size of the previous mentioned studies)\nshowing the classical pattern of modulation of the perceived\narm length after the active session (see details in ‘‘Forearm\nBisection Task’’ section) were called back; therefore, the active\nsession was always performed first. Previous evidence with this\nparadigm showed no sequence effect in the active condition\nif performed in two different sessions at 1 week of distance\n(Garbarini et al., 2015a); therefore, it makes it unlikely that any\ndifference found between the two manipulations in the present\nstudy (active and passive) should be due to the sequence order\n(active first).\nForearm Bisection Task\nThe experimental task consisted in a forearm bisection task\nalready used in previous studies aiming at investigating the\neffectiveness of tool-use training (e.g., Sposito et al., 2012;\nGarbarini et al., 2015a). While blindfolded, participants were\ninstructed to indicate, by using their left index finger, the\nmidpoint of their right distal upper limb segment comprising\nthe forearm and the hand, considering the elbow and the tip\nof the middle finger as the two extremities. During the task, in\norder to prevent any possible tactile feedback from the bisections,\nthe right forearm was kept in a radial posture and placed\ninside a Plexiglas parallelepiped (70× 10 × 11 cm3). On the\ntop of the Plexiglas screen, above the arm, a paper ruler with\ncentimeters was attached. The 0 cm of the ruler corresponded\nto the elbow, in order to easily measure the position of the\nsubjective midpoint (p). Then, in order to obtain a percentage\nscore relative to each participant’s subjective arm length, we\nused the following formula: [(p/arm length in cm) × 100].\nDuring the task, corrections were not allowed. In each session\n(i.e., active; passive), each participant performed a total of\n30 forearm bisection judgments, 15 before (pre-training) and\n15 after tool-use training (post-training; Sposito et al., 2012;\nGarbarini et al., 2015a).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe mean forearm bisection value obtained for each subject in\neach session (i.e., active; passive) before and after the tool-use\ntraining was used as the dependent variable. These data were\nentered in a 2× 2 repeated-measures ANOVA with two within-\nsubject factors Session (two levels: active; passive) and Time (two\nlevels: pre-training; post-training). Post hoc comparisons were\nperformed by means of Newman–Keuls test. The analysis was\nperformed using Statistica software 8.0 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,\nUSA). We reported mean, standard deviation, andp-value, and\nwhen a significant effect was found, the effect size (η2) and power\nwere reported as well.\nRESULTS\nWith respect to the mean forearm bisection values, the ANOVA\nfound a significant main effect of Time (F(1,9)= 25.47,p = 0.0007,\nη2 = 0.74, power = 0.99), with significantly greater values\n(i.e., increased arm length perception) in the post-training than\nin the pre-training phase. Crucially, a significant Session∗Time\ninteraction (F(1,9) = 21.04, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.7, power = 0.98)\nwas found, suggesting that the perceived length of the forearm\nwas modulated by the session. In particular,post hoccomparison\nshowed a significant increase of the perceived arm length\nin the post- with respect to the pre-training phase in the\nactive session ( p = 0.001; Figure 3 ), while no difference\nemerged between the post- and the pre-training phase of the\npassive session (p = 0.76). It is important to note that the\npre-training of both the active and passive session did not\ndiffer (p = 0.08), but interestingly, the post-training phases\nof both sessions were significantly different (p = 0.008), with\na significant increase of the perceived arm length in the\npost-training of the active with respect to the post-training of\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 September 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 299\nBruno et al.

Furthermore, the post-training phase of\nthe active session was significantly different from all the other\nconditions (p always <0.01 for each comparison; percentage\nscore relative to each participant’s subjective arm length,\nmean ± SD: pre-training active = 46.4 ± 6.7; post-training\nactive = 54.7 ± 7.3; pre-training passive = 47.8 ± 5.6;\npost-training passive = 47.4± 8.7).\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study aimed at investigating how tool-use may shape\nthe body metric representation. We contrasted two different\nand (partially at least) alternative views. According to the first\nview, the actual execution of tool action would be enough for\nthe shaping to occur, while the second view postulates that\na coexistence between action goals to be accomplished and\nbodily movements is necessary; i.e., it is not enough that the\nbodily movements are merely executed, the action programs\nand goals have to be motorically represented. Body metric\nrepresentation was measured by means of a forearm bisection\ntask. In this task, participants were asked to indicate the\nmidpoint of their right upper limb segment comprising the\nforearm and the hand, considering the elbow and the tip of\nthe middle finger as the two extremities (Sposito et al., 2012).\nThe forearm bisection task was performed before and after\ntwo different tool-use training sessions. Indeed, participants\nunderwent a session in which theyactively performed 20 min\nof tool-use training and a session in which the tool-use training\nwas passively performed by means of robotic assistance. The\nmain finding was that participants exhibited a significantly\nincreased arm length estimation in the post- with respect to\nthe pre-training phase after the active session only. Indeed,\nwhen the tool-use training was performed in the Passive\nsession, in which participants were instructed to maintain a\nrelaxed posture while the robot passively moved their arm, no\nmodulation of the perceived arm length occurred. This suggests\nthat the mere production of tool action is not enough for\nshaping agent’s body representation. Specific motor programs\nof the tool action need instead to be voluntarily implemented\nand represented.\nOur finding is in line with some previous studies suggesting\na role of motor processes and representations in the subjective\nestimation of body metric. For instance, Garbarini et al.\n(2015a) showed that hemiplegic patients may increase the length\nestimation of their paralyzed forearm after a training phase in\nwhich an experimenter was aligned to them and repeatedly used\na tool. Indeed, the patients showed a pathological embodiment of\nthe experimenter’s arm, thus having real intentions to move the\ntool as if they were actually performing the training with their\nown paralyzed arm. And this was enough for the perceived arm\nlength increase to occur, or so the authors argued. In a similar\nvein, a very recent study on healthy subjects has demonstrated\nthat body metric estimation can be modulated by the sense\nof agency (D’Angelo et al., 2018). Participants were asked to\nperform a forearm bisection task before and after a training\nphase, in which they virtually grasped objects and make precision\ngrip by controlling a far 3D virtual hand. The training phases\nconsisted of two conditions characterized by a different timing\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 5 September 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 299\nBruno et al.

In a synchronous condition, participants\nwere shown virtual hand movements responding in real time\nto their own right-hand movements, while in an asynchronous\ncondition, a 3-s delay was interposed between the participants’\nreal hand and the virtual hand movements. The results showed\nthat participants pointed to their forearm midpoint more\ndistally after performing the training phase in the synchronous\ncondition, where they sensed agency for the far virtual hand.\nAccording to their results, only if participants sensed agency for\nthe virtual hand, induced by the synchronicity, and therefore\nexperienced a sense of congruency between the intention to\nperform the action and the motor output coming from the\nmovement performed did they show the classical modulation of\nbody metrics. Similarly, the notion of congruency is ubiquitous\nwithin the body literature. We experience the rubber-hand\nillusion (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998) under the synchronous\ncondition but not under the asynchronous condition, for\ninstance. More specifically, in the context of tool-use, it has\nbeen demonstrated that the peri-personal space expands after\na session of near touch and congruent visual stimuli presented\nfar (Serino et al., 2015). This is not the case when training was\nincongruent. Accordingly, in our study, the shaping of the body\nmetric representation occurs only when there is a congruency\nbetween action goals and bodily movements, as in the\nactive training.\nTaken together, these and our findings indicate that\nmotor processes and representations, involved in planning and\nmonitoring tool action, may also play a critical role in shaping\none’s own body metric representation. But how to explain this?\nA candidate hypothesis is that subjective estimation of body\nmetric hinges on processes and representations which are not\nonly sensory but also motor in nature. Planning and monitoring\na tool action requires the agent to represent motorically both\nbodily and tool movements as if the tool was a part of the agent’s\nbody (Gallese and Sinigaglia, 2010). This would involve not only\nan increase of the range of action, by making reachable things\notherwise unreachable, but also a functional extension of the\nbody, with the tool being incorporated much like a prosthetic\ndevice (Serino et al., 2007). Such incorporation does not occur if\ntool action is passively performed with the assistance of a robotic\narm. There is here no need for an agent to represent her own body\nand action goals because tool action execution is fully driven by\nthe robotic arm.\nThis hypothesis seems to be supported by evidence coming\nfrom different domains. For instance, Anelli et al. (2015) reported\na similar dissociation between active and passive tool action in\nthe time domain. Participants were asked to perform a time\nbisection task, by reproducing half of the duration of visual\nstimuli presented in near and far space, before and after an active\ntool-use training phase. The results showed a clear dissociation\nin the perceived duration between far and near stimuli. Indeed,\nparticipants exhibited a leftward bias in the time bisection task\nwith near stimuli and a rightward bias with far stimuli. Strikingly,\nthis dissociation disappeared after the training phase, since the\nfar stimuli were perceived as nearer. In line with our findings,\nthe dissociation did not disappear if the tool actions involved in\nthe training phase were passively executed, without any motor\npreparation and control.\nSimilar results have been found in the spatial domain.\nThere is a huge amount of evidence that tool actions may\nextend the agent’s space representation, with this extension\noccurring after short-term (Serino et al., 2007) as well as\nlong-term (Serino et al., 2007; Bassolino et al., 2010) tool-\nuse, even if the interpretation of the consequences of tool-use\nin the spatial domain is controversial (Holmes et al., 2004).\nSeveral studies took advantage of a cross-modal congruency\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 6 September 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 299\nBruno et al. How Tool-Use Shapes Body Metrics\ntask (Spence et al., 2004). In this task, participants speeded\ntheir performance when stimuli from different modalities (e.g.,\ntactile and visual) are temporally and spatially congruent.\nIndeed, it has been shown that the detection of tactile stimuli\ndelivered to the body is more effectively influenced by visual\n(Macaluso and Maravita, 2010) or auditory (Occelli et al., 2011)\nstimuli occurring near to, as compared to far from, the body.\nInterestingly, short-term tool-use has been found in healthy\nsubjects to increase the impact of far visual distracters on tactile\ndiscrimination (Maravita et al., 2002; Holmes et al., 2004).\nAnalogously, acting with a tool, which gets things otherwise out-\nof-reach, has been demonstrated in brain-damaged patients to\nexpand visuo-tactile extinction from near to far space (Farnè and\nLàdavas, 2000; Maravita et al., 2001; Farnè et al., 2005). As far\nas long-term tool-use is concerned, blind cane users provide a\nparadigmatic case of extensive and functionally highly relevant\npopulation that constantly perform actions by means of a tool.\nSerino et al. (2007) asked blind cane users and sighted subjects\nto respond as soon as possible to tactile stimuli on their hand,\nwhile ignoring concurrent sounds presented either near to the\nstimulated hand or approximately 120 cm far from it, before\nand after a training phase, which consisted in exploring the\nfar space with a cane. The results showed that sighted subjects\nresponded faster to tactile stimuli associated with far sounds after\nthe training phase only. The effect was absent before the training\nphase and disappeared when the sighted subjects no longer used\nthe cane. On the contrary, holding the cane, without actually\nusing it, was enough for the blind subjects to result in faster\nreaction times to touches coupled with sounds occurring at the\nfar space (i.e., at the tip of the cane). Things were different when\nthe blind subjects held a short handle. As in sighted subjects\nbefore the training phase, reaction times were faster to tactile\nstimuli associated with near sounds only (Serino et al., 2007).\nAll these results point to a change in the way in which\nthe body and the space around it are represented when tool\nactions are planned and monitored, suggesting that these actions\nmay involve a short or even a long-term tool embodiment,\nsuch that the tool becomes part of the acting body (Berti and\nFrassinetti, 2000; Maravita et al., 2001; Farnè et al., 2005).\nHowever, although body and space representations are strictly\nrelated, this does not imply that they both rely on the same\nprocesses and mechanisms. For instance, in the Galli et al. (2015)\nstudy, healthy subjects performed a training with a very special\ntool (i.e., wheelchair) in Active and Passive conditions and,\nafter that, they underwent a classical audio-tactile looming task\n(Canzoneri et al., 2012; Serino et al., 2018) used to evaluate\nthe post-training effect on the peripersonal space representation.\nThey did not find the expected results after the active condition,\nlikely because, as proposed by the authors, the very unfamiliar\ntool action (such has moving a wheelchair for healthy subjects)\nmight have prevented the occurrence of the external space\nremapping, by shifting the attention on the internal motor\neffort. Interestingly, they found a remapping of the peripersonal\nspace after a passive training (i.e., when the wheelchair was\npushed by someone else) but only when participants can see\nthe explored environment (and not when they are blindfolded).\nOn the same vein, Costantini et al. (2011) have systematically\ninvestigated how tool action affects space representation. They\nfound that not only actively using a tool but also merely observing\nsomeone else using a tool may extend one’s own reaching space.\nFor the extension to occur, the observer had to do nothing\nmore than holding a tool compatible with the goal and the\nspatial range of the observed action, thus sharing the same\naction potentialities with the observed agent. It makes sense\nthat visual information, when present in Passive condition (Galli\net al., 2015), as well as in observation condition (Costantini\net al., 2011), plays a crucial role in shaping the coding of\nthe space around the body. A different result was obtained\nwhen the effect of tool-use observation on body representation\nwas investigated. Garbarini et al. (2015a) asked participants to\nperform a forearm bisection task after and before observing\nsomeone else performing tool actions. The results did not\nshow any modulation of the perceived arm length, even when\nthe participants held a tool compatible with the observed\naction. Although further research is needed, this indicates that,\ndifferently from space representation, the representation of the\nbody is mostly sensitive to motor processes and representations\ntypically involved in planning actions and monitoring their\nexecution. Since here, as in the latter study, we focused on body\nrepresentation (and not on space representation), it is likely\nthat visual information, commonly available during both active\nand passive training, may result in a less effective shaping of\nthe space representation, thus making unaffected our forearm\nbisection task.\nTo sum up, when there is a coexistence between action\ngoals and bodily movements, tool-use may shape body metric\nrepresentation. Otherwise said, whether people represent (or\ndo not represent) the program and the goal of their actions,\nwhen using a tool, has important consequences on what\nthey perceive about the length of their body parts. This can\nbe of interest not only from a theoretical but also from a\nclinical point of view. First, the present findings confirmed\nthat motor planning and control play a crucial role for the\npromotion of motor learning, which is responsible for the\nplastic changes in body representation (Classen et al., 1998;\nBenarroch, 2006) and is the basis of the rehabilitation in\nneurologically impaired subjects (Lotze et al., 2003). Indeed,\nif no active participation is provided, no motor learning\nis attained and, reasonably, no plastic modulation of body\nrepresentation can occur, as found in the present study after\nthe Passive condition. By contrast, it is well established that\nmotor learning is promoted if the assistance is reduced to a\nminimum (assist-as-needed mode), allowing the subject to exert\nhis/her residual voluntary control as much as possible during\nthe execution of goal-directed movements (Sanguineti et al.,\n2009). This specific assistive mode, easily implementable in\nrobotic devices, can therefore optimize the effect of rehabilitation\nthrough facilitation of motor learning and the promotion of\nneural plasticity.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to\nthe corresponding author.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 7 September 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 299\nBruno et al.
