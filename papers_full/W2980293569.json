Introduction\nThe EHV and UHV transmission networks are required \nfor bulk power transfer over long distances as to cater \never increasing electrical demands. It has brought the \nnew challenges to provide the insulation system for the \ndifferent equipment coming across the transmission \npath from generation end to the consumer end. The \nlevel of switching surges for the forthcoming EHV and \nUHV transmission networks are predominantly high \nand therefore the high voltage equipment must operate \nreliably to deal with more volatile and dynamic operating \nconditions.\nPower transformer, one of the most important \nelectrical equipment in transmission network for \nproviding reliable energy flow and shares the largest \ninvestments for an electric utility in project executions 1. \nThe prospective upshot of transformer miscarriage may \nreact in unfavorable destruction of power system that \nin turn forces the system into collapse 2. Henceforth, the \noperational consistency and lifespan of transformers \nprincipally depend on attributes and standard of non-\nconducting material used for heat transfer and electrical \nisolation purposes3.\nOne of the conceivable disputes with present-day \nliquid-solid insulation structure in power transformer \n*Author for correspondence\nIndian Journal of Science and Technology, Vol 12(27), DOI: 10.17485/ijst/2019/v12i27/142960, July 2019\nISSN (Print) : 0974-6846\nISSN (Online) : 0974-5645\nA Review on Electrical Characteristics of Nanofluid based Transformer Oil\nIndian Journal of Science and Technology\n2\nVol 12 (27) | July 2019 | www.indjst.org\nthat confines the smallness in blueprint/design of a \ntransformer is the conflicting permittivity between \nthem. Since the low standards and attributes, the liquid \ndielectric was pressurizing more than the solids at ac \nand/or impulse voltages, which force transformer to be \nexplosive in operation 4. Aside from the crucial job like \nshielding solid dielectrics, arc extinguishing and cooling, \nliquid insulations can also diminish the acoustics in \ntransformers5. As a result, the mineral oil’s characteristics \nto survive with emerging demand of high voltage \ntransmission networks are undeniably essential3.\nAt present time, the word nanofluid becomes \neminent and well known that leads the challenges and \nopportunities to the analysts over the past decades. The \nnames “nanofluids” and “Nano-liquids” are employed \ncollaboratively to express transformer oil/nanoparticle \ncombination for electrical isolation and chilling purposes\n3. \nParticles (single, multiple or hybrid) with nano scaled \ndimensions are scattered with small percentage figure \nin transformer oil will construct the nanofluid and was \nintroduced by experimenters at the Argonne National \nLaboratory6.\nRecently, many researchers have published the \narticles, which are based on thermal properties of \nnanofluids\n6 – 10, 43. However, a very less attention has been \ngiven to examine the electrical characteristics of Nano \nliquids. Hence, an attempt is made in this paper to present \nthe comprehensive review on electrical characteristics of \nnanoparticle based transformer oil.\n2.  Types of Nanoparticles for Transformer \nOil\nThe mineral oil is commonly used for chilling and isolation \npurpose in transformers due to its excellent physical, \nchemical and dielectric characteristics, which is the \nutmost requirement for better performance and long life \nexpectancy of transformers. The investigations reported \nso far in the literatures on the adoption of nanostructured \nmaterials in mineral oil have demonstrated the drastic \nimprovement in its chemical, heat transfer and electrical \nisolation properties11.\nTo attain these attributes of nanofluids, most \nremarkable trouble is the choice of the nano-dimensioned \nparticles. Varieties of nano scaled particles have been \nexperimented so far 12 – 42and they are labeled as per \nelectrical conductivity and permittivity into three \nconsiderable classifications:\n• Conducting Nanoparticles: Fe3O4, Fe2O3, ZnO, SiC\n• Semiconducting Nanoparticles: TiO 2, CuO, Cu 2O, \nCdS\n• Dielectric Nanoparticles: Al2O3, SiO2, BN\nFigures 1 and 2 show the host fluids and various hybrid \nnanoparticles used by researchers during investigations, \nrespectively43.\nFigure 2. Hybrid Nano-composites43.\nFigure 1. Host Fluids43.\nIndian Journal of Science and Technology\n3\nVol 12 (27) | July2019 | www.indjst.org\nMihir A. Bhatt and Praghnesh J. Bhatt\nThe properties of a mineral oil based nanofluid \ndeveloped after dispersion of either mono or hybrid \nnanoparticles widely be influenced by type, shape, size, \nconstancy of dispersed nanoparticles, type of host fluid \nused and weight percentage of concentrated nanoparticles. \nExtensive research on nanofluid has shown the evidence \nof remarkable improvement in cooling performance \nthan conventional fluid and preparation techniques for \nnanofluids is discussed in following section.\n3.  Dispersion Techniques of \nNanofluid\nThe nanoparticles dispersed with an intention to \nenhance the insulation and cooling performance should \nkeep the basic properties such as electrical and thermal \nconductivity, dielectric constant, denseness and relaxation \ntime constant. \nOut of these attributes, the rate of electron conduction \nand electron hindrance are the key properties to enhance \nelectrical characteristic of nanoparticle based transformer \noil. After the selection of an appropriate host fluid and \nnanoparticles as given in Figures 1 and 2, the crucial \nchallenge encountered by the scholars is to take the \nappropriate method to devise the transformer oil based \nnanofluids. In general, the nanofluids can be formulated \nby using single step or 2-step methods as described.\nSingle-step Method: Inside single step approach, the \nnano scaled particles are disseminated conventionally \ninto a host fluid to lessen the possibility of forming cluster \nwith augmented stability\n3, 12. One of the potential issues \nwith this approach is the origination of agglomeration \nduring the bulk creation. The cluster formation of \nthe nanoparticles can be prevented by evaporation-\ncondensation method.\nTwo-step Method: This method is largely used for \nfabricating the nanofluids. In first stage of development, \nthe particles of different shapes at nano range are \nfirstly manufactured as dry powders via physical and \nchemical processes. In second stage, magnetic stirrer or \nultrasonication achieves the steady dispersal of particles \nin host fluid. This method uses the distillation process for \nbulk creation of nanofluids that makes this mechanism \nof producing nanofluids high-priced. The basic flow of \nthis method is shown in Figure 3. Table 1 outlines the \nmethodologies adopted by different analysts to develop \nthe nanofluids.\nFigure 3. Two-step method for preparation ofnanofluid44.\n4.  Electrical Properties of \nNanofluids\nThe reliability and efficient performance of power/\ndistribution transformers are extremely biased by \nthe physical, chemical and electrical properties of the \ndielectrics used within. The mineral oil is the most \npreferred coolant and insulator in the transformers as \nit possesses all these features. The nanofluids prepared \nfor augmentation should demonstrate its excellent \nperformance upon the application of high AC, DC and \nimpulse voltages. In addition to that its characteristic \nbehaviour should be evaluated for the partial discharge, \nelectrical conduction nature and relative permittivity. \nThis section comprehensively deliberates the insulation \nbehavior of nanofluids considering the dimension/mass, \nnature and concentration of nanoparticles, moisture level \nand ageing.\n4.1 AC Dielectric Strength\nSupreme prerequisite for the liquid dielectric that governs \nthe harmless operation of transformers, which are cooled \nby such liquids, is the dielectric strength. Generally, a \nnumerous procedures suggested by the standards are \nemployed to investigate the electrical stress withstanding \ncapacity of the dielectric liquid by emphasizing them to \nnearly homogenous electric field. The magnitude of AC \nsparking potential deliberately specifies the grade of the \noil.\nThe presence of the impurities and chemical agents \ndissolved for achieving superior properties significantly \naffects the liquid’s dielectric strength.

Bhatt\nthe liquids formulated by dispersing the nanoparticles \nwith an intention to replace the existing mineral oil. \nThe discussions over the electrical withstanding power \nof various nanofluids investigated by the scholars \nhave been given in subsequent section. Table 2 shows \nthe enhancement reported by different researchers in \nbreakdown strength.\nThe dielectric strength of SiO2 based mineral oil under \ndifferent ppm of moisture was investigated with different \nvolume fraction of nanoparticles and the reported results \nare shown in Figure 4\n16. Due to hydrophilic nature, the \nsurface of silicone dioxide can bind the water droplets \neffectively and thus reduces the effective electrical \nconduction in liquid. This will help in increasing the AC \ndielectric strength of prepared nanofluid by dispersing \nSiO2 NPs in mineral oil.\nIn17 have demonstrated the results of AC BDV for \ntransformer oil and magnetic fluid as a function of \nvolume concentration at different ppm of water content. \nIn Figure 5, remarkable improvement is observed in \nbreakdown voltage with increasing the moisture level \nupto 0.2 g/lconcentration. The conductive nanoparticles \nact as electron scavengers, trap the electrons, turn into \nlow mobility particles, and thus enhance the dielectric \nstrength. On the other hand, it is shown that the dielectric \nstrength is declined with upturn the percentage level of \nnanoparticles.\nIn\n18 have executed investigation on transformer \noil mixed with magnetic nanoparticle at volume \nconcentrations of 0.08% to 0.45% to evaluate the \nbehavior of breakdown voltage. Figure 6 shows Notable \nenhancement in dielectric strength of nanofluid at lower \ngap distance between two electrodes. The dispersed \nmagnetic nanoparticles can act as electron scavengers to \nslow down the speed of massless electrons by transforming \nthem into slow negatively charged atoms. On contrary, \nthe dielectric strength is worsened when the distance is \nincreased.\nIn19 have prepared TiO 2 based nanofluid using \ncationic surfactant Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide \n(CTAB). They noticed the improvement in breakdown \nvoltage because of the existence of suitable concentration \nof the surfactants which can effectively opposes the Van \nder Waals attraction force between the nanoparticles \nto stabilize them. Furthermore, the modified surface \neffectively influences on trapping and de-trapping process \nof electrons.\nThe effect of surface treatment on breakdown voltage \nof silica nanoparticles is examinedby\n20. The change \nobserved is shown in Figure 7. As depicted in the figure, \nthe enhancement has observed in dielectric strength \nwhen the mineral oil is prepared by dispersing the \nsilicon dioxide nanoparticles with and without surface \ntreatment. The discharged water droplets bound by the \nnanoparticles due to its hydrophilic nature-giving rise to \nhigh dielectric strength.\nThe Figure 8 shows the results reported by21 when the \nbase liquid was modifying by dispersing the graphene \nnanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. The amelioration of \nthe dielectric strength may occur due to: (1) the dispersed \nnanostructures alter the state of electrodynamics within \nthe host oil and (2) the bigger values of the electrical \nconductivities reduce the charge relaxation time constant.\nIn 22 have examined the effect of aging on insulation \nstrength of nanofluids prepared by dispersing conducting, \nFigure 5.  BDV mean values as a function of ferrofluid \nconcentrations at10 ppm, 33 ppm and 45 ppm \nmoisture level\n17.\nFigure 6.  Breakdown voltage with different MNP’s \nconcentration18.\n\nA Review on Electrical Characteristics of Nanofluid based Transformer Oil\nIndian Journal of Science and Technology\n6\nVol 12 (27) | July 2019 | www.indjst.org\nsemi-conducting and non-conducting nanoparticles. \nFigure 9 reveals that the electrical strength of ferrofluid \nand pure oil declines because of aging albeit the electrical \nstability of non-conducting and semiconducting \nnanoparticles shows less dependency over the thermal \naging.\nThe influence of Ag-WO3 based hybrid nanoparticles \nover the dielectric strength of transformer oil is \ninvestigated by 45. They have prepared the hybrid nanofluid \nby one-step method and measured the constancy by zeta \npotential. The experiment shows little bit reduction in \ndielectric strength as compared to transformer oil due to \nhigher electrical conductivity of silver nanoparticles and \nagglomeration occurs at high concentration.\nIn 46 have examined the electrical isolation power of \ntransformer oil based nanofluids containing silica and \nsilver-coated silica with Newtonian flow behavior. The \nreduction observed in dielectric strength after dispersing \nthe silica in transformer oil is due to moisture absorption \nnature of silica. Furthermore, the conductive nature \nof silver nanoparticles reduces the dielectric strength \nconsiderably when hybrid (silver supported silica) \nnanoparticles were dispersed in transformer oil.\nIn contrast, the dispersion of numerous nanoparticles \ncan enhance the electrical strength of transformer oil \nto great extent under the high electrical field compared \nto the fluid developed by individual nanoparticles\n47. \nThe amplification of electrical strength is achieved due \nto absorption offered by nanoparticles towards the free \nelectrons when it is ionized by applied electrical field.\nIn \n48 have examined the influence of plasma treated \nand untreated SiO 2 nanoparticle based nanofluid on \ninsulation characteristic of transformer oil and shown \nin Figure 10. The dielectric strength can be improved by \nachieving the homogeneous dispersal and unwavering \nsuspension of fine particles by applying plasma treatment \non the nanofillers.\nIn 49 have achieved the enhancement of 2.2% in full \ndischarge voltage when transformer oil is modified \nby dispersing graphene quantum dots. The reduction \nin effective electron mobility due to electron charging \nphenomena of nanoparticles that convert fast moving \nelectrons to slow negatively charge carriers can enhance \nFigure 9.

Bhatt\nelectrical stress withstanding capacity of transformer oil \nbased nanofluid.\nIn 50 have made the efforts to investigate the breakdown \nperformance of SiO 2 dispersed mineral oil based \nnanofluid. The dielectric strength shows the dependency \nover the volume fraction of nanoparticles. The reduction \nobserved in breakdown voltage at higher concentration is \nexplained by electric double layer (EDL) model.\nIn 51 inspected the insulating properties of botanical \ntransformer oil with three different nanoparticles \nat different level of concentrations. They found the \naugmentation in breakdown voltage as 44%, 32% and 11% \nfor TiO\n2, ZnO and CuO based nanofluids respectively. On \ncontrary as shown in Figure 11, the dielectric strength of \nCuO based nanofluid is reduced dramatically as compared \nto others. The increase in size of CuO nanoparticles due to \nmore aggregation reduces the surface to trap the electrons \nthat harms the dielectric strength.\nIn \n52 have developed the vegetable oil based nanofluid \nby dispersing exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) \nand examined its AC breakdown voltage strength at \n25\n0C and 90 0C with gradual increase in volume fraction \nof nanoparticles. Figure 12 shows the influence of \nnanoparticle concentration on AC breakdown voltage.\nFluid developed by Y ao et al.52 has shown remarkable \nimprovement in dielectric strength of base fluid at different \ntemperature ranges with different concentrations of h-BN \nnanoparticles.\n4.2 DC Breakdown Strength\nThe dielectric strength of TiO 2 dispersed transformer oil \nunder high voltage DC is examined by 23. The addition of \nsemiconductive nanoparticles can improve 28% value of \nnegative DC breakdown strength. However, the positive \nDC breakdown voltage was lower than the host oil.  \nTable 3 shows the obtained values during the investigations \ncarried out by them\n23.\nIn 24 have observed that the dispersed semiconducting \nNPs can provide the augmentation to the insulation \nstrength under DC voltage due to its trapping and \nde-trapping nature. The augmentation of dc dielectric \nstrength of nanofluid was 1.27 times more than the  \nhost oil.\nFigure 13 shows the results of investigation conducted \nby researchers for the influence of dispersing Fe 3O4 \nnanoparticles as a function of gap length25. The formation \nof bubbles due to localized heating and the injection of \nfield-emitted electrons with and without magnetic field \ncan reduce DC breakdown voltage at 2% concentration.\nFigure 14 represents the influence of nanoparticle’s \nvolume fraction on DC breakdown voltage strength of \nvegetable oil based nanofluid examined by\n52. Due to the \npolarization of the nanoparticles under applied DC field, \nthe electrons produced by the ionization will trapped by \nthe formulated electrical charge around the surface of NPs \nand thus helps in reducing the probability of ionization to \nprevent the breakdown.\nFigure 11.

They \nnoticed that the breakdown strength is decreasing when \nthe Fe2NiO4 nanoparticle is dispersed along with CdS in \ntransformer oil. Increase in nanoparticles concentration \nwould result in reducing the separation between two \nparticles and increase the chance of agglomeration. These \nclusters lead to distort the electric field extensively and \nadditionally reduce the electron trap surface.\nIn \n61 have inspected the DC strength of vegetable oil \nbased nanofluid prepared by dispersing Boron Nitride \n(BN) nanoparticles at different volume size as a function \nof heat range. Figure 15 shows the results obtained by \nthem.\nThe breakdown voltage is enhanced due to removal \nof moisture content from the liquid with rise in heat rate. \nThe dispersion of BN nanoparticles at high concentration \nhinders the progression of dielectric breakdown.\nIn 62 have made the efforts to check the DC strength \nof transformer oil by preparing the nanofluid by adding \nFe3O4 and BN nanoparticles. The result verifies the \nbetter performance when nanofluid is prepared by BN \nnanoparticles as compared to Fe\n3O4 based nanofluid.\nIn 63 have conducted the DC breakdown voltage test \nas per D3755 standard on TiO 2 transformer oil based \nnanofluid impregnated pressboard. The results show the \nremarkable improvement of 5.97% and 6.5% in positive \nand negative DC breakdown voltages respectively.\n4.3 Impulse Breakdown Strength\nTables 4 and 5 shows the outcomes for failure of pure oil \nand TiO\n2 based nanofluid studied by applying impulse \nvoltage with positive and negative polarity26.\nThe dispersion of semiconductive nanoparticles \neffectively changes the scattering of space charge caused \nFigure 15.

Bhatt\nby shallow traps and thus modifies the appearances of \nstreamer transmission and interruption. At the head of \nstreamer during positive polarity, the electrical field is \ndistorted extensively due to induced negative charges that \ndelay the propagation of streamer whereas it speeds up \nwhen negative impulse is applied.\nWang et al.27 deliberated the effect of three dissimilar \nnanoparticles on impulse breakdown strength at different \nconcentrations. Figures 16 and 17 shows the result of \nfailure at applied impulse voltage as a function of size \npercentage for three dissimilar nanoparticles.\nThe dielectric strength improves due to the alteration \nof space charge activity until the critical value of \nconcentration is achieved. The nanoparticles with greater \nvolume in transformer oil can lead to the evolution of the \nclusters and hence diminish the breakdown voltage.\nThe 11.2% augmentation in impulse strength of Fe\n3O4 \nmodified transformer oil was examined by Y ang et al. 32. \nThe electrons crossing the gap at fast velocity were trapped \nand turned into slow running electrons that hinder the \nionization process and thus improve the impulse strength.\nThe inspection on electrical strength of h-BN \nnanoparticle based vegetable nanofluid under application \nof an artificial lightning impulse as per the methodology \nof IEC 60897 is reported by 52. Figure 18 shows the results \nobtained for impulse BDV at positive and negative \npolarity of applied impulse wave for different densities of \nnanoparticles.\nThe impulse breakdown voltage strength of pure \nvegetable oil can be improved by dispersing the \nnanoparticles in the host fluid. They noticed 22.0% and \n28.8% improvement in positive and negative impulse \nvalues respectively. Furthermore, the value of negative \nimpulse was examined lower than the value obtained \nduring application of positive impulse. The difference \nobserved due to reversal of polarity was explained on \nbasis of space charge behavior.\nZhou et al.\n64 have demonstrated the test results \nof conducted impulse voltage test on transformer \noil modified by suspending Fe 3O4, TiO 2 and Al 2O3 \nnanoparticles. The dispersed nano-structured particles \ncan modify the beginning and transmission processes of \npositive streamers in transformer oil.\nIn \n65 have conducted an experiment to examine \nthe alteration occurred in impulse dielectric strength \nwhen both mineral oil and natural esters modified \nby nanoparticles. The modification to the host fluids \nachieved by dispersing silica nanoparticles during the \nexperimentation. The 30% augmentation achieved due \nto the hydrophilic property of silica nanoparticles, which \nhas tendency to absorb the water to alter the degree of \nFigure 16.

The high voltage \nimpulse test was conducted by concentrating the nanoparticles \nin host oil at weight of 0.02 g/l, 0.04 g/l and 0.06 g/l respectively. \nThe results showed 42.3% of augmentation in impulse strength \nwhen nanoparticles were dispersed at weight of 0.04 g/l. The \nnegative results were noticed when the concentration of the \nparticles was more than the optimum value.\nThe experimentation to evaluate the impulse strength \n(with positive and negative polarity) of pure oil based \nmagnetic nanofluid as a function of volume portion, \ndimension of nanoparticles and diverse gap lengths was \nconducted by \n67.\nFigures 19, 20 and 21 show the results of positive and \nnegative impulse BDV value obtained by loading multiple \nnanoparticles in transformer oil by considering volume \nportion, size of nanoparticles and gap span between two \nelectrodes\n67.\nInvestigation results have depicted 0.4 and 20 nm values \nas optimum concentration and size for nanoparticles \nrespectively to obtain augmentation in electrical stress \nholding capacity of insulation under positively applied \nshort duration voltage of high magnitude as compared \nto carrier oil. Contradictory, an application of negative \nimpulse voltage shows worse performance as compared \nto base fluid.\nIn68 have prepared nanofluid by spreading ZnO \nnanoparticles in Refined Sunflower Oil (RSFO) type \nnatural esters to investigate impulse dielectric strength. \nThey evaluated 28.95% and 20.04% extension in impulse \nstrength as compared to carrier fluid. The reduction \nin electrical conductivity due to slowing down the \ntransmission velocity of streamer enhances the dielectric \nstrength.\nTable 6 represents the list of the researchers who \nhave conducted the experiments to evaluate the impulse \nstrength of nanofluids.\nFigure 19.

Bhatt\n4.4  Partial Discharge Inception Voltage \n(PDIV)\nPDIV characteristics before and after aging of pure oil \nand equivalent nanofluids was studied by22. Before aging, \nthe ferrofluid does not modify the PDIV characteristic \nsignificantly as compared to tin oxide and SiO 2 based \nnanofluids. For both AC and DC voltages, silicone dioxide \nbased nanofluids shows the improvement. Additionally, \ncompared to the mineral oil and other nanofluids, aged \nSiO\n2 shows the better response. The enhancement shown \nby silicon dioxide based nanofluid is due to its hydrophilic \nproperty.\nThe partial discharge test to examine the facts of \nnanoparticles on inception of partial discharges had \nbeen executed\n23. Table 7 shows the results obtained after \nperforming partial discharge test. The positive results \nare obtained for partial discharge inception voltage and \ndischarge magnitude. The addition of semiconducting \nnanoparticles diminishes the probabilities of incidence of \npartial discharge initiation.\nThe trapping and de-trapping nature of semiconducting \nnanoparticles improves the PDIV characteristics for \nboth new and aged TiO\n2 based nanofluid 24. The 1.12% \nenhancement is achieved as compared to mineral oil.\nJin et al. 28 has studied the incomplete discharge \nperformance of fluid produced by disseminating 0.01% \nof fullerene and silica nanoparticles.  Under positive DC \nvoltage, twenty percent improvement was noticed in \nPDIV value for silica based transformer oil compared to \nits pure state. Furthermore, the discharge magnitudes for \nsilica and fullerene nanofluid were scaled down to 63% \nand 33% respectively. The reaction of the nanoparticle’s \nsurface with acid in mineral oil leads less effect on partial \ndischarge behavior.\nIn \n75 have developed the magnetite-based nanofluid \nto investigate partial discharge inception voltage \ncharacteristic. The lower concentration of nanoparticles \ncould enhance PDIV characteristic as compared to \ncarrier oil and at higher concentration. The conductive \nnanoparticles attract the electrons emitted due to \nionization and turns into negative ions to quench the \navalanche.\nIn \n76 have made an effort to develop the natural ester \nbased nanofluid by dispersing TiO 2 nanoparticles for \nexamining the partial discharge inception performance \nunder applied ac voltages. The negligible enhancement in \nPDIV of nanofluid has noticed.\nIn 77 have made an effort to examine the PDIV for aged \nnanofluid prepared by dispersing the semiconducting \nnanoparticles at low and high moisture content. The \naging to the fluid was achieved by heating the oil at 130°C \nfor 6 days. The Figure 22 shows the results obtained for \nthe voltage magnitude at which the partial discharge \nactivity begins. Because of dispersion of semiconducting \nnanoparticles, the rate of moisture opposition and anti-\nageing properties of aged pure oil enhances which further \ngiving rise to corona inception voltage.\nTable 8 represents the list of the researchers who \nhave conducted the experiments to evaluate the PD \ncharacteristics of nanofluids.\n4.5 Critical Characteristics\nCritical characteristics include the electrical conductivity, \npermittivity, dissipation factor, resistivity, flash point \nand fire point. Several researchers have contributed to \nidentify the effect of nanoparticles on such unavoidable \nparameters. In\n29 have investigated the influence of semi \nconductive Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) quantum dots on \nrelative permittivity and dissipation factor by preparing \nthe fluid at various concentrations.

In general, due to the defects/\nimpurities in the insulations during its development, it \nalways possesses the two different kinds of permittivities \ni.e. real permittivity and imaginary permittivity. \nThe electrostatic forces exerted between the electrons \nand positive ions are greatly influenced by real part of \npermittivity whereas the dissipation factor/dielectric \nlosses depend on imaginary part of permittivity. At \nsmall concentrations of nanoparticles, the real part \nof permittivity was enhanced but at concentration, \nmore than the optimum value increases the electrical \nconductivity due to rise in its surface area that leads to \nincrease in imaginary permittivity and hence dielectric \nlosses.\nIn\n30 have carried out the research on mixture of \nMgMnNi NPs and transformer oil to observe the \nperformance of electrical conductivity at diverse \nvolume percentage of nanoparticles. Figure 25 shows \nthe dependency of electrical conductivity on volume \nfraction nanoparticles. They observed the linear increase \nin electrical conductivity with increase in concentrations.\nThe resistivity and electrical conduction property \nof transformer oil modified by AGQD nanoparticles as \na function of thermal stress was investigated by\n49 and \nshowed in Figures 26, 27 respectively.\nFigure 23.

The surfactant \nplays a dynamic role in the stabilization of nanoparticles \nthrough two different mechanisms: (1) Steric stabilization \nand (2) Electrostatic stabilization. Steric stabilization was \nattained by capping the active surface of nanoparticles \nwith surfactant to the degree that reduces surface activity \nand prevents agglomeration. Figure 29 shows the steric \nstabilization and role of surfactant.\nIf the surfactant is covered with low surfactant, \nthe agglomeration of nanoparticles may occur due to \ninsufficient coating which do not cover the particle fully \nand hence unable to oppose the wan der waal attraction \nforce which tend to reduce the electrical performance of \nthe nanofluids developed for insulation purpose.  \nOn the other hand, with excess amount of surfactant, \nadsorption sites on nanoparticle surface will be rare. \nHence, surfactant will form a double chain around the \nsurface of nanoparticles, resulting in a reverse effect\nThe electrostatic stabilization is achieved by charging \nthe particles with the same polarity as shown in Figure \n30. In this model a layer of oppositely charged ions, called \ncounter ions or coions, counter balances the charges. The \ncoions exist in two distinct layers. The inner layer stuck \nto the nanoparticle surface called stern layer, which is \ncharacterized by high concentration of coions. The other \nlayer extends from the stern layer to the zero charging \nregion of the oil called the diffuse layer.\nFigure 30.  Electrostatic stabilization and double layer \nmodel19.\n70 B. Du et al.

Bhatt and Praghnesh J. Bhatt\nIn26 have proposed a mechanism to explain the \nsignificant change happened in the streamer transmission \ndue to modification in space charge scattering when TiO2 \nnanoparticles were dispersed in transformer oil.\nThe ionization probability reduces due to trapping \nand de-trapping charge transportation in oil as the \nTiO\n2 nanoparticles upturns the shallow trap density in \nnanofluid and thus builds up the negative ions which \nmodifies the electric field at the head of the streamer \ntransmitting towards the ground electrode.\nFor positive polarity as shown in Figure 31(a), the \nelectric field at the streamer tip is enhanced while at \nground electrode it is weakened. Thus, it is tough for \npositive streamers in nanofluid to expand which results \nin increase in positive breakdown voltage. Contradictory, \nfor negative polarity as shown in Figure 31(b), the electric \nfield at the negative streamer tip is weakened as compared \nto ground electrode. As an effect, the streamers will \npropagate to the ground electrode at high velocity.\nIn\n29 proposed that the quantum dots of smaller \nsize can increases the surface area and allows more \ntrapping to the electrons that helps in improvement \nof dielectric properties. The presence of appropriate \ncontent of surfactant can improve the morphology of \nnanoparticles and hinder the physical agglomeration \nof them\n31 - 32 projected a model based on space charge \ninhibition on improvement of dielectric strength. Figure \n32 shows the space charge diffusion characteristics in \nmodified transformer oil. The adsorption of free charge \nby nanoparticles could improve the insulation strength \nby (1) delaying electron’s movement, (2) blocking charge \ninjection in transformer oil, (3) sinking the space charge \ndensity and (4) augmenting the uniformity of the electric \nfield.\nAccording to the postulation proposed by Derjaguin-\nLandau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO), the cumulative \nreaction between two particles is the mixture of \nelectrostatic repulsion force and van der Waals attraction \nforce\n19, 33. When nanoparticles are separated by a distance \nlarger than the combined thickness of their electric \ndouble layers, there would be no interaction between \nthe nanoparticles. The repulsion takes place when the \nnanoparticles moves closer and overlaps the double \nlayer. Stabilization is maintained when the repulsion \nforce becomes equal or exceeds van der Waals attraction \nforce otherwise agglomeration occurs. The addition of \nsurfactant will increase the number of coions and hence \nincreases in electrostatic repulsion force which in turn \nenhance the dielectric property of nanofluid.\nIn\n47 have analyzed the alteration achieved in dielectric \npossessions of transformer oil by dissolving discrete and \nmanifold nanoparticles and discussed the mechanism \nof modification achieved in dielectric properties. The \naddition of multiple nanoparticles could improve the \npolarization and improves the rate of electron absorption \nas compared to individual nanoparticles.\nMost of the researchers have also proposed the \nenhancement mechanisms in dielectric properties on the \nFigure 32.

Conclusion\nEmerging nanofluid research brings the ample \nopportunities to the researchers in developing the \nnanoparticle based high voltage electrical insulation fluids \nwith superior properties as equaled to present mineral oil. \nThe survey reported in this article discusses the efforts \nplaced in past years with an intention to investigate the \nperformance of nanofluid based transformer oil under \nheavy electrical stresses. Although, the superiority of the \nnanoparticle based transformer oil has been confirmed, \nstill, many facts i.e. the mechanism of ionization that could \nbe applicable equally to the variety of the nanoparticle \nbased insulation fluid, performance of nanofluids \nunder magnetic field, performance of nanofluids under \ncontaminated state, selection of nanoparticles for \nproviding both insulation and heat transfer performance \nwhen they intended to disperse in transformer oil, \ndissipation factor, arc suppression characteristics etc. \nneed to be discovered. In-depth experimentation \nand multidisciplinary research is required for better \nunderstanding of mechanisms and behavior of nanofluids \nto resolve the prevailing challenges.\n7. References\n1.
