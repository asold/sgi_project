    "abstract": "For the development of the aviation industry, machine tools are becoming large and travel long distances, making optical alignment setup difficult. An auto-tracking laser interferometer (ATLI) is proposed and researched in this paper for the squareness error measurement of machine tools or coordinate-measuring machines (CMMs). The procedure involves measurement of only one line of an axis, and the measurement results provide us information about not only the positioning errors but also the squareness errors. This specially designed interferometer instrument can be useful in checking industrial machine tools in a short time.",
