Introduction\nThe issue of resource saving in the electric power industry, which has been repeatedly raised at international councils \non large electrical systems of high voltage - SIGRE, remains relevant to the present day, including the \nimplementation of resource-saving relay protection of power transformers against shor t circuits, without the use of \nexpensive and having significant weight and dimensions of metal -intensive current transformers (CTs) and current \nrelays with ferromagnetic cores [1 –3]. To improve the reliability of traditional current protections, made on bo th \nelectromechanical, semiconductor or microprocessor-based, it is advisable to apply duplication of protections, and to \nobtain the maximum effect it is necessary to duplicate the protection device itself and the current transducers \nthemselves [4–5]. As an  alternative to the use of CTs and the corresponding protections built with their use, it is \npossible to consider various magnetically controlled elements, such as Hall sensors, magnetoresistors, \nmagnetodiodes, magnetotransistors, inductance coils, reed and Rogowski coils [6–13]. To build the relay protection \nof power transformers without the above-mentioned CTs, reed switches were chosen [12–13]. They were chosen due \nto the fact that in comparison with other similar magnetosensitive elements they have advantages, which are that the \nsignal is transmitted not through measuring circuits, but through control circuits, at the same time they can perform \nthe functions of analog-discrete and measuring transducer, as well as the measuring body of protection, while having \na low cost and small weight parameters in comparison with CTs and current relays with ferromagnetic cores. Work \non the development of resource-saving current protections without the use of CTs with ferromagnetic cores based on \nreed switches has been carried out since the 1960s. In recent decades, there are already a number of developed \ncurrent protections using reed switches [14 –19]. This paper presents and discusses the principle of operation of the \ndeveloped gas protection, as well as oil level control offered in the form of devices. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n*Corresponding author: Dauren_pvl2012@mail.ru\nE3S Web of Conferences 434, 01041 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202343401041\nICECAE 2023\n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Gas relay and its: a) rectangular beaker; b) front view; c) side view \n \nThe gas protection works in the following way. Before turning on the power transformer in operation, this device is \nscrewed into the pipe section with the help of a bolt -and-wrench joint 13, having previously installed oil -resistant \ngaskets 12 on both sides of the housing 1, fo r the protrusions of the housing 1 (Fig.1b). Before opening the lid 5 of \nthe housing 1, a rectangular -shaped beaker 6 is placed inside, with the first 14, second 15 and third 16 flat plates \ninstalled inside it. For visual observation of the gas level in th e body 1 there is an observation window 2 on one of \nthe sides. The first 14, second 15 and third 16 flat plates mounted on the second axis 17 through reciprocating \nsprings 19 (designed to limit the movement of these plates 14, 15 and 16 on the second axis 17) set in the cup 6, \nunscrewing the cover 7. After securing the glass 6 to the side walls of the housing 1 with the first 8 and second 9 of \nthe bushing, screwed to one end of the first axis 10, the other end of these axes 10 is fixed with the first screws 11 to \nthe housing 1 (Fig.1a). The round plate 21 is located on the outer bottom side of the cup 6, which also, as the first 14, \nsecond 15 and third 16 plates are fixed to the second axis 17. The distance between all plates (flat 14,15,16 and \ncircular 21) is strictly fixed and corresponds to the volume of gas and oil filled in the gas relay when they pass \nthrough the pipeline to the expander. The first 14 and second 15 plates react to an increase in the level of gas and oil \nin the power transformer, and the  third 16 to their decrease. The round plate 21 located on the outer bottom side of \nthe cup 6 is the perception organ of the device, which reacts to the level of oil and gas in it. The necessary exit of the \nround plate 21 from the cup 6 is carried out by t he second screw 18. The first 14, second 15 and third 16 flat plates \nare the executive body of the device and are designed for closing the first, second and third contacts.   \nIn nominal load mode, and if there are no winding faults in the transformer windi ngs, the round plate 21, and \nrespectively the first 14 and second 15 flat plates do not go up, and the third 16 plate does not go down and \nrespectively no signal, both to turn off the power transformer, and in the alarm circuit to the service personnel. Wi th \na small release of gases due to the short circuit of a small number of turns inside the transformer, the upper part of its \ntank is filled with gas (Fig. 2). This gas in small bubbles rises up through the pipeline to the expander and passes \nthrough this device, while the round plate 21 rising up, respectively, raises behind itself the second axis with the first \n14, second 15 and third 16 flat plates fixed on it. The first plate 14 reaching the first pair of contacts closes between \nthem, signaling a fault in the transformer in the alarm circuit to the operating personnel, that is, the transformer gas \nprotection is triggered by the signal (Fig. 1a). \nAt the rapid release of gases, resulting from the short circuit of a significant number of turns inside the tr ansformer, \nthe upper part of its tank is filled with a large volume of gas. This gas rushes up the pipeline to the expander (Fig. \n2b). The gas together with the oil passing through the gas protection device, raising the round plate 21 upwards, it in \nturn raises behind itself the second axis with the first 14, second 15 and third 16 flat plates fixed on it. \nThe first plate 14 reaching the first pair of contacts, as well as the second plate 15 reaching the second pair of \ncontacts close between them, simultaneously signaling both the fault and the power transformer tripping circuit. The \ngas protector responds to the signal and to the tripping of the transformer (Fig.1a). This process occurs as follows. \nRaising up the first plate 14 closes its (first) pair of co ntacts, having a certain stroke margin due to the reciprocating \nspring 19, it is compressed and at the same time the second plate 15 also rising up, closes its (second) pair of contacts \nto close. After switching off the transformer's gas protection, the ga s is inspected and taken from the housing 1 by \nmeans of the tap 4, placed on the cover 5. \n \n \nFig. 2. Gas relay: a) its general view; b) fixing it in the transformer pipe section \n \nWhen the oil level in the power transformer decreases, this level also decrea ses in the gas protection device, while \nthe round plate 21 goes down and the second axis with the three flat plates 14, 15 and 16 fixed on it goes down with \nit. The third plate 16 reaches the third pair of contacts and closes them with each other, signalin g a fault in the \ntransformer to the operating personnel. The gas protection of the power transformer is triggered by the signal \n(Fig.2b). \n3\nE3S Web of Conferences 434, 01041 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202343401041\nICECAE 2023\n2.3  Checking the oil level in the power transforme \nOil level control, presented in the form of a device contains reed switches 1,2,3 and 4 with open contacts 5,6,7 and 8 \n(Fig.3 a), the transformer tank 9, the expansion tank 10, the transparent bulb 11 with four reed switches installed \ninside it, closed at both ends with covers 12, the covers themselves have slots 13 for scre wing off and tightening the \ncovers 12 with screwdrivers, holders 14 with installed on them clamps 15, necessary for fastening the reed switches \n1,2,3 and 4.

After that, to the wall of the expansion \ntank 10 with the first 21 and second 24 screws, previously installed on both sides of the transparent bulb 11 oil -\nresistant gaskets 25, screw it with the first two screws 21 through the first two axes 20 to the wall of the expansion \ntank 10, as well as the top 16 and bottom 17 with permanent magnets 22, through the second axis 23 and with the \nsecond 24 screws, also to the wall of the tank 10 (Fig. 3b).

The location of the top 16 and bottom 17 permanent magnets corresponds to the maximum and \nminimum oil level mark in the expansion tank 10, respectively the oil level in the tank of the power transformer 9. If \nthe oil level in the tank of the power transformer 9 corresponds to the nominal level, the contacts 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the \nreed switches 1, 2, 3 and 4 remain open and there is no signal for a failure or for switching off the power transformer. \nWhen the oil level in the tank  of the power transformer 9, due to an increased load or an increase in ambient \ntemperature, respectively, increases the oil level in the expansion tank 10 to the maximum mark (Fig. 3b). In this \ncase, the oil inside the expansion tank 10 lifts up the trans parent bulb 11 along the displacement level 18, reaching \nthe initial level 26 with a positive temperature of  . Reed switch 1 passes through the top 16 permanent magnet and \nfalls under the influence of its magnetic field, as a result of its contact 5 close s and sends a signal to the sound and \nlight alarm circuit about the increase in the oil level in the tank of the power transformer 9. As the oil level in the \ntank of the power transformer 9 continues to rise, the transparent bulb 11 continues to rise up, reaching the limit level \n27 with a positive temperature  .In this case, the reed switch 2 also passes through the top 16 permanent magnet and \nfalls under the influence of its magnetic field, contact 6 reed switch 2 closes and as a result, it gives a signal in the \ncircuit of switching off the power transformer from the mains. \nWhen the oil level in the tank of the power transformer 9 decreases, the oil level in the expansion tank 10 also \ndecreases and reaches the minimum mark (Fig. 3b). With a decrease in the oil level in the expansion tank 10 the \ntransparent bulb 11 goes down along the level of displacement 18 reaching the initial level 28 with a negative \ntemperature of  С. Reed switch 3 passes through the bottom 17 of the permanent magnet and falls under the influence \nof its magnetic field, contact 7 of the reed switch 3 closes and sends a signal in the chain of audio and light alarm on \nlowering the oil level in the tank of the power transformer 9. As the oil level in the tank of the power transformer 9 \ndecreases further, the transparent bulb 11 continues to go down, reaching the limit level 29 with a negative \ntemperature of  C. As a result, the reed switch 4 also passes through the bottom 17 permanent magnet and falls under \nthe influence of its magnetic field, the contact 8 of the reed switch 4 closes and sends a signal to the circuit to turn off \nthe power transformer from the mains. \nThe effect of the gas protection device lies in the simplicity of its operation, its light weight, the minimum of used \nparts, thus eliminating significant economic costs than when implementing the same transformer gas protection using \ntraditional gas relays. \nThe oil level control device is characterized by the absence of the use of pointer, glass flat and tubular oil indicator, \nthus responding to the urgent issue of relay protection - resource saving, and the use of reed switches, which are \ncharacterized by such characteristics as: ease of operation, low weight, long service life   and above -the number of \nreed switch actuations), low cost and the ability to operate at ambient temperatures from - 600C to + 1250C together \nallow to use this device to monitor the oil level in the power transformer.   \n \n3.
