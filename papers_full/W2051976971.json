The use of diﬀerent kind of probes and as well as diﬀerent\ndiagnosis techniques has been widely reported i.e., fault detection\nin metallic pipes and structural frames by means of non-destructive\ntests [5–7], fault detection in electric circuits [8–11] and fault detection\nin rotating machines [12–16]. Its application to the early detection of\ninsulation faults in high voltage power transformers will be presented\nin this paper as a cheaper, eﬃcient and simpler alternative to the use\nof conventional diagnosis methods.\nAlthough diﬀerent techniques exist for fault diagnosis in power\ntransformers all of them present considerable limitations. Dissolved\ngas in oil analysis (DGA) [17–20], is a widely used method for the\ndetection of hot spots inside the machine, but On-Line machine\ndiagnosis with this procedure requires complex, expensive equipment\ncapable of detecting the diﬀerent gases dissolved in the transformer oil\nas a consequence of the failure. Partial discharge analysis [21, 22] has\ntraditionally been used for quality control during the manufacturing\nprocess. The recent development of equipment that incorporates\ndigital processing techniques, as well as the existence of new sensors,\nhas led to its on-site application. However, sensor installation and\ninterpretation of the results are both complex and expensive.\nPower factor tests have also been applied to industrial\ntransformers for several decades [23], yet this technique only gives a\ngeneral indication of the status of a machine’s insulation system and\ndoes not permit the detection of minor or marginal failures. Other\nnew techniques such as RVM (Return Voltage Method), TDDS (Time\nDomain Spectroscopy, FTIF (Fourier Transform Infrared), NIR (Near-\nInfrared Spectroscopy), Power Factor as function of frequency, etc.\nare still being explored with very promising results. Nevertheless,\nindustrial application remains expensive and complex, especially for\ngeneralised use in distribution transformers [24–26]. It is clear, then,\nthat there is a need for simple, low cost methods for monitoring the\ncondition of power transformers.\nLeakage ﬂux measurement is a cheap, simple and eﬃcient\nalternative since it can be easily done in any kind of transformer. In\nthe next sections the theoretical foundations of leakage ﬂux analysis in\nthree-phase transformers will be presented. Finite elements models of\ntransformers with diﬀerent type of windings, operating at normal and\nfaulty conditions, will be used to demonstrate the ability of leakage ﬂux\nto detect inter-turn insulation faults. The On-Line diagnosis method\nbased on leakage ﬂux analysis will be applied to a large 400 kVA high\nvoltage transformer thus demonstrating the simplicity and reliability\nof this new diagnosis procedure.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 114, 2011 213\n2. THE LEAKAGE FLUX IN THREE-PHASE\nTRANSFORMERS\nIn power transformers, not all the ﬂux produced by the primary\nwinding passes through the secondary winding, nor vice versa. Instead,\nsome of the ﬂux lines exit the iron via the air. The portion of magnetic\nﬂux that goes through one of the transformer windings but not the\nother is calledleakage ﬂux[27], and the amount of leakage ﬂux mainly\ndepends on the ratio between the reluctance of the magnetic circuit\nand the reluctance of the leakage path [28]. Leakage ﬂux lines in\ntransformers are curved at the ends of the coils and ﬂow through the\nair almost parallel to the winding axis [29]. The degree of curvature of\nthe lines is aﬀected by the distance between the coils and the machine’s\nshield and the latter’s distribution in the air is inﬂuenced by the type of\nwinding used in the machine’s construction [29]. Leakage ﬂux lines in\na healthy transformer have a horizontal axis of symmetry that passes\nthrough the middle of the magnetic core of the machine. When a short-\ncircuit, or even a strong deformation, of one or several turns occurs,\nthis symmetry is lost, therefore leakage ﬂux can be used for the early\ndiagnosis of insulation faults. Below, a simple theoretical approach for\nthe analysis of the leakage ﬂux in the windings of a power transformer is\npresented. This approximate analysis will show the symmetrical nature\nof leakage ﬂux and will allow the establishment of the foundations for\na diagnosis procedure. Theoretical results will be complemented with\nﬁnite element models of transformers with diﬀerent type of windings\nwhere the actual distribution of leakage ﬂux will also be analysed.\nThe magnetic core and windings of a three-phase power\ntransformer can be represented in an approximate way for the analysis\nof the leakage ﬂux by means of the theory of the images [30, 32].\nElectromagnetic problems involving a planar perfect electric or perfect\nmagnetic conductor can be handled through the image principle, in\nwhich the surface is replaced by image sources that are mirror images\nof the sources of magnetic or electric potential [30]. This method can\nbe easily applied to a core limb of a three-phase transformer in order\nto demonstrate the spatial symmetry of leakage ﬂux. Figure 1 shows\na graph with the application of this principle.\nIn the graph a core limb of a transformer with a single layer of\nwinding is represented. For the sake of simplicity only the right side of\nthe winding is used in the analysis. This simpliﬁcation is reasonable\nsince the contribution of the left-side winding to the leakage ﬂux can\nbe neglected if only the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the ﬂux\nis being studied.\nTaking into account that the normal component of the magnetic\n214 Cabanas et al.\nTheory of \nthe images  \nTRANSFORMER  \nCORE LIMB  X  \nY  WINDING\nSIMPLIFIED DOMAIN FOR \nLEAKAGE FLUX ANALYSIS \nh\nLEAKAGE FLUX\nLEAKAGE FLUX \n \nB   = 0Y B   = 0Y\nµ ≅ ∞ µ ≅ µ0\nh\nFigure 1.

Single conductor and coordinates system.\ninduction By is nil in the outside surface of the magnetic core, the\ntheory of the images can be applied to the surface of the core limb. By\nsimply adding a second layer of winding (image of the actual winding)\nat the internal face of the core, the same boundary conditions for the\nmagnetic ﬂux density are achieved. In this way, the leakage ﬂux density\nin the outside of the core limb can be approximately calculated by\nobtaining the ﬂux created by the two layers of conductors of the new\nsimpliﬁed domain [31, 32].\nThe calculation of the ﬂux created by the new domain can be easily\ndone by integrating the ﬂux density created by a single conductor [33].\nTherefore, the ﬁrst stage of the analysis will consists of the calculation\nof the normal componentBy of the magnetic ﬂux created by a single\nconductor at a pointP of coordinates (x0, y0, z0). Figure 2 shows a\ngraphical representation of the conductor and the coordinates system\nused for the analysis. According to previous work [33], the ﬂux density\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 114, 2011 215\ncreated by the conductor can be expressed as follows:\n⃗B = µ0\n4π\nL∫\n−L\nI · d⃗l ∧ (⃗ r− ⃗ r′)\n|⃗ r− ⃗ r′|3 (1)\n⃗ rbeing the position vector of the diﬀerential elementd⃗l and ⃗ r′ the\nposition vector of theP point. According to Figure 2 the position\nvectors can be calculated as:⃗ r= l·⃗i+a·⃗j and ⃗ r′ = x0 ·⃗i+y0 ·⃗j +z0 ·⃗k.\nTherefore, the normal component of the ﬂux density By can be\nobtained by means of the following equation:\nBY = µ0\n4π\nL∫\n−L\n−z0 · I · dl(√\n(x0 − l)2 + (y0 − a)2 + z2\n0\n)3 (2)\nBy integrating the above equation the ﬂux density can be\ncalculated as follows:\nBY = µ0 · I · z0\n4π\n(\n(y0 − a)2 + z2\n0\n)\n[\nx0−L√\n(x0−L)2+(y0−a)2+z2\n0\n− x0+L√\n(x0−L)2+(y0−a)2+z2\n0\n]\n(3)\nThe above expression is simpliﬁed if the length of the conductor is not\ntaken into account. In fact, if the conductor is considered to be inﬁnite,\nthe limit whenL → ∞of Equation (3) must be calculated in order to\nobtain the ﬂux densityBy. In this case, the result for the magnetic\ninduction is the following:\nBY = − µ0 · I · z0\n2π\n(\n(y0 − a)2 + z2\n0\n) (4)\nOnce the ﬂux density created by a single inﬁnite conductor has\nbeen obtained the following stage of the analysis process will consist\nof the calculation of the ﬂux density created by a single layer of\nconductors. Figure 3(a) shows a diagram with the coordinates system\nand the layer of conductors. The total current of the layer, sum of the\nindividual currents of each conductor, is designed byIT .\nThe ﬂux density created by the layer of conductors can be\ncalculated by integrating Equation (4) along thez axis (between 0\nand H). To do this, a current diﬀerential element can be deﬁned as\nthe quotient between the total current and the height of the layer:\ndI = IT\nH · dz (5)\n216 Cabanas et al.\nThe contribution of this diﬀerential current to the ﬂux densityBy\nat the pointP of coordinates (x0, y0, z0) can be easily calculated by\nmeans of Equation (4):\ndBY = −µ0 · ITOT · (z0 − z) · dz\n2π · H\n(\n(y0 − a)2 + z2\n0\n) (6)\nFigure 3(b) shows the current diﬀerential element and the domain\nintegration for the layer along thez axis.\nP(x0,y0,z0) \nY  \nX  \nZ\na \nH\nTotal current=IT\nZ \nz\nH  \n \nP(x0,y0,z0) \nY  \ny0 \nz0-z \na\ndz\ndI= Ir\nH . dz\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3.

For the particular case of\na1 = 0,a2 = W and y0 = W the set of conductors is located at theX\naxis and the ﬂux densityBY is calculated just in the external surface\nof the right layer of conductors. Under these conditionsBY can be\ncalculated as:\nBY =−µ0·ITOT\n2·A·H ·\n\n−W ·Ln\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\nW2 + z2\nW2+(z−H)2\n⏐⏐⏐⏐+\n∑\ni=0,H\n2·(z−i) · atg\n( W\nz − i\n)\n\n(12)\n218 Cabanas et al.\nThis is the equation that allows the calculation of the ﬂux density\ncreated by the simpliﬁed domain of Figure 1. In fact, only the\ndimensions W and H of the set of conductors are needed to obtain\nBY . Therefore, if BY is calculated along the total heightH of the\nlayers of conductors its symmetry can be established and thus the\nsymmetry of the leakage ﬂux created by the winding of a transformer\nwill be also demonstrated. The simplest way to study the symmetry\nof BY is plotting the function for a wide range of values of the variable\nZ:\n \n SYMM ETRY AXIS \nBMAX \n-BMAX \nZ=0 Z=H/2 Z=H \nBY \nZ  \nFigure 5.Flux densityBy along a line parallel to the multiple layers\nof conductors (Z axis).\nIn this plot, the axis of symmetry is clearly located at the middle of\nthe height (H/2) of the set of conductors. The maximum ﬂux density\nis reached at the two ends of the set of conductors. From these two\npoints the magnetic ﬂux slowly decreases to zero with the distance.\nThese results can be directly extrapolated to the simpliﬁed domain of\nFigure 1 where two layers of conductors substitute the winding of the\ntransformer. If this is done the symmetry of the leakage ﬂux is also\ndemonstrated. In fact, Figure 6 shows the ﬂux density obtained for\nthe transformer by means of Equation (12) applied to the simpliﬁed\ndomain of Figure 1. The symmetry of leakage ﬂux is clearly appreciated\nin Figure 6.\nOnce the spatial distribution of leakage ﬂux density has\nbeen analytically calculated and its symmetrical nature has been\ndemonstrated the foundations of a diagnosis method for the early\ndetection of inter-turn insulation faults can be established. Leakage\nﬂux can be analysed by measuring the voltage it induces in very simple\nair core coils located at the surface of transformer windings. Figure 7\nshows a diagram where the location of the coils and its equivalent\ncircuit are presented. If coils are identical and symmetrically installed\nleakage ﬂux will induce the same electromotive force in both coils.\nThis fact is easily demonstrated since leakage ﬂux is symmetrical for\nthe surfaces covered by both coils.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 114, 2011 219\nTRANSFORMER  \nCORE LIMB  \nZ \nBY \nWINDING\nh\nLEAKAGE FLUX \n SYMMETRY \nAXIS  \nBM A X -BM A X 0 \nLEA K A GE FLU X  SPA TIA L \nD IST RIBU TI ON\nB   = 0Y\nµ ≅ ∞\n2\nh\n2\nh\nFigure 6. Symmetry of the leakage ﬂux produced by a transformer\ncore limb.\nThe diagnosis method will be thus based on the detection of\nchanges caused in leakage ﬂux line paths by the presence of the\ninsulation failure. When a short-circuit, or even a strong deformation,\nof one or several turns occurs, the symmetry of the leakage ﬂux is lost\nand the fault can be detected by measuring voltage changes induced in\nthe sensors. In fact, the diﬀerence of the electromotive forces induced\nin the coils VOUT will be theoretically nil for a healthy transformer\nwhile it will present a value, proportional to the fault level, in the case\nof a faulty transformer. In practice, a healthy machine will produce\na residual value ofVOUT since neither the windings nor the coils can\nbe built absolutely symmetrical. This oﬀset value is not a problem\nfor a correct diagnosis since it can be measured when the machine is\ninstalled and all the successive measures may be referred to it. In the\nfollowing section ﬁnite elements simulations of real transformers with\nconcentric and disc-type windings will be presented in order to analyse\nin depth the proposed method.\n3. FAULT DIAGNOSIS ON LOW VOLTAGE MACHINES:\nSIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nPower transformers generally present two diﬀerent structures in their\nwindings: concentric layer windings and disc-type windings. Figure 8\nshows these two types of winding. The concentric layer windings are\nbuilt by winding several layers of conductor along the total length of the\ncore limb. Primary and secondary windings are thus concentric and\nseparated by an insulating material. Disc-type windings are formed\nby a set of discs. Every disc is toroidally wound around the core\n220 Cabanas et al.\n \n \nN1\nR phase \nLeads \nU pper  \ncoil\nLower coil \nVOU T \nCOILS EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT\nFigure 7.

Primary and secondary windings are formed by the series\nconnection of several discs that are usually alternatively distributed\nalong the magnetic core limbs.\nSimulation and experimental analysis have been carried out in\nboth type of transformer in order to check the symmetry of the\nleakage ﬂux as well as the reliability of the proposed method. For\nthe experimental analysis two transformers of 12 kVA were built. Both\nmachines incorporated a set of leads connected to the windings in order\nto apply inter-turn insulation faults. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the\nexternal appearance of the transformers and their main speciﬁcations.\nIn both cases the leads and connectors to apply inter-turn short-circuits\nare clearly visible.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 114, 2011 221\n \nR \nShortcircuit \nconnections \nS \nT \nFigure 9.

Disc-type windings experimental transformer.\nAlthough analytical methods are valid to solve complex\nelectromagnetic problems [34–38] and some authors have even\nproposed new approaches [39], ﬁnite element method (FEM) has been\nproved as a very accurate technique for diagnosis and analysis of\nelectromagnetic devices [41–44], especially in the ﬁeld of electrical\nmachines since it can include actual characteristics of the healthy and\nfaulty machine [45–47]. Therefore, the theoretical study of leakage\nﬂux used for the development of the method was carried out by means\nof commercial software of electromagnetic analysis by the FEM. By\nmeans of the simulation of both transformers the symmetry of the\nleakage ﬂux was checked as well as the capacity of the method to detect\nfaults aﬀecting a single turn with the transformer operating at diﬀerent\nload levels [48]. In all the cases the simulation and experimental results\n222 Cabanas et al.\ndemonstrated it was possible to detect an insulation fault aﬀecting only\na single turn, even when the failure current was so strongly limited that\nthe machine did not suﬀer any permanent damage. The successful\ndetection under so adverse conditions ensures the capability of the\nmethod to detect the most incipient insulation faults in any industrial\ntransformer.\nIn ﬁrst place, the results of the ﬁnite element models will be\npresented in order to show the line paths of leakage ﬂux in transformers\nwith the most common types of winding. A perfect symmetry of\nleakage ﬂux will be observed in all the cases prior to producing the\ninsulation fault. However, once an insulation fault has occurred the\nleakage ﬂux strongly increases in the region of the failure loosing this\nway its natural symmetry. Figures 11 and 12 present the results of\nthe simulation of the concentric windings transformer and the disc-\ntype windings transformer respectively. In these ﬁgures the leakage\nﬂux density (Wb/m) along a line parallel to the windings has been\ncalculated in diﬀerent time instances of the electrical cycle, for both\nthe transformer operating in normal conditions and after producing\nan inter-turn short-circuit. The presented results clearly show the\nbehaviour of the diagnosis method. In all the cases the ﬂux density\nis symmetrical along the windings when the machines are healthy.\nHowever, if a single turn is short-circuited a strong concentration\nof ﬂux appears in the region of the failure and leakage ﬂux is no\nlonger symmetrical. This change in the line paths of the leakage\nﬂux can be easily detected by means of the measurement of the\ninduced electromotive force in coils installed at the winding surface\n(Figure 7). Therefore, it can be aﬃrmed that simulation results clearly\ndemonstrate the symmetry of the leakage ﬂux for any type of winding\n \nHEA LT HY    \nt=0 m s   \nt=5 ms   \nt=15 ms   \n1 SHORTED  TURN   \nt=0 ms   \nt=5 ms   \nt=15 ms   \nH EA LTH Y  TRA N SFORM ER   \nDISTANCE  DISTANCE  \nFLUX (Wb/m)  FLUX (Wb/m)  \nH/4 H/2 3/4H  H H/4  H/2 3/4H  H \nH    \nShorted  \nturn  \nCONCENTRIC  \nFigure 11.

Once the simulation has validated the theory about the\nleakage ﬂux, experimental results will be presented.\nExperimental tests were carried out on both transformers after\ninstalling a pair of coils in every phase. Coils were machine wound\nwith 100 turns of insulated copper wire. All the tests were carried out\nwith the failure current limited to 1.2 times the rated current of the\nwindings. In this way, the machine integrity was completely preserved.\nDiﬀerent load levels, from no load to the rated load, were applied to\nthe tested transformers and the results demonstrated the inﬂuence of\nload in the diagnosis could be neglected. In all the cases the variable\nused to diagnose the insulation fault was the induced electromotive\nforce VOUT, obtained as the sum of the electromotive forces induced\nin every single coil. This variable is close to zero when the windings\nare healthy and presents a signiﬁcant value when an insulation fault\nexists. Figure 13 shows some of the results obtained for the concentric\nwindings transformer before and after producing an inter-turn short-\ncircuit in the R-phase with the machine operating at no load. The\ngraphs show how the amplitude of the total electromotive forceVOUT\nis almost 7 times higher when the fault is present, although the fault\ncurrent has been limited to 1.2 the rated current of the windings. As\nexplained in Section 1, the residual value ofVOUT obtained for the\nhealthy transformer (whose peak amplitude is only 22 mV), is caused\nby the asymmetries of both the transformer windings and the coils for\nleakage ﬂux measurement.\nFigure 14 shows the results obtained for the disc-type windings\ntransformer. In this case, the fault indicatorVOUT has been measured\nfor the R and S-phases simultaneously, although the inter-turn\ninsulation fault has been applied in the R-phase only. The results\n224 Cabanas et al.\n \n \n200 \n150 \n100 \n50 \n0 \n-200 \n-150 \n-100 \n-50 \n-20 ms 10  ms/D iv \n200 \n150 \n100 \n50 \n0 \n-200 \n-150 \n-100 \n-50 \n-20 ms 10  ms/D iv \n \nCON CEN TRIC W IN D IN GS \nH EA LTH Y  TRA N SFORM ER \nN O LOA D  \n22 mV  \n20ms 120 mV  \n20ms \nCON CEN TRIC W IN D IN GS \n1 SH ORTED  TU RN  \nN O-LOA D  \nVOU T (mV ) \nR-Phase coils \nVOU T (mV ) \nR-Phase coils \n \nFigure 13.

A very slight increase in the\nVOUT of the S-phase can also be detected. This minimum variation is\ncaused by the inﬂuence of the leakage ﬂux created by the fault of the\nR-phase on the measurement coils of the S-phase. This phenomenon\nhas been observed in adjacent phases during the experimental tests\nbut it does not create any drawback for the application of the method.\nThe inﬂuence of one phase on the other is negligible if it is compared\nto the strong eﬀect caused by the fault on the measurement coils of\nfaulty phase. Moreover, the magnitude of the faults applied to the\ntransformer is so low and the sensitivity of the method so high that no\npossibility of misinterpretation of the results exist.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 114, 2011 225\n4. FAULT DIAGNOSIS IN HIGH VOLTAGE MACHINES\nIn order to demonstrate the possibility of industrial application of the\ndiagnosis method on large HV transformers, experimental tests were\ncarried out on a large machine specially modiﬁed to apply inter-turn\ninsulation faults. The transformer used for these tests was a 400 kVA–\n22 kV/400 V industrial transformer. Figure 15 shows the external\naspect of the machine as well as its main technical speciﬁcations.\nThe windings of this transformer were redesigned in order to install\na series of leads, externally connected to a set of bushings, from\nwhich it is possible to short-circuit 1, or 2 turns in any phase of the\nmachine. Figure 16 shows photographs of the original windings of the\ntransformer and the new windings after installing the leads. Since the\ntransformer is a high voltage machine and electrical insulation must\nbe kept, the leads were connected to a set of new bushings installed\nin the top of the machine casing. In this way, by simply connecting a\nresistance between the new bushings it was possible to limit the failure\ncurrent of the inter-turn short-circuit to the desired value. The new\nbushings can be observed in the photograph of Figure 15. In order\nto measure the leakage ﬂux two coils manufactured with 100 turns of\ncopper wire were also installed at the surface of the windings.\nNEW  \nBU SH INGS\nFigure 15.High voltage transformer used for the experimental tests.\nSince the coils were installed at the surface of the windings they\nwere insulated by means of high voltage mica-epoxy tape. In this\nway, the induced electromotive force measured by them was easily\ntransferred to the outside of the machine. Figure 17 shows two\nphotographs of the installation of the ﬂux measurement coils.

It is important to point out that because of the high\npower (400 kVA) of the machine the experimental tests could only be\ndone with the machine unloaded. This restriction is not a drawback\nfor the implementation of the method in large HV transformers since\nprevious tests and simulations carried out in low voltages machines\ndemonstrated the eﬀect of load on the proposed diagnosis method is\nnegligible. In fact, although Figures 13 and 14 show results obtained\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 114, 2011 227\n \nH V  W I N D I N G \n11 Layers \n(2038 turns \ntotal) \nCOILS FOR LEA K A GE \nFLU X  M EA SU REM EN T \nLV  W I N D I N G \n23 Layers (single \nband of conductor) \nU pper coil \narea \nLower coil \narea \nU pper coil \narea \nLower coil \narea \nFigure 18. Structure of the windings and location of the ﬂux\nmeasurement coils.\nwith no load and with the 50% of the rated load respectively the\nevolution of the output variableVOUT can be considered identical in\nboth cases.\nTaking into account that the aim of the new diagnosis method\nis the early detection of incipient faults, all the tests were performed\nwith only a shorted turn. Moreover, the short-circuit current ﬂowing\nthrough the faulty turn was limited to 2 times the rated current.\nIn fact, fault current was limited to 21 A for a turn of the primary\nwinding that in rated conditions must carry 10.5 A. Therefore, if this\nlow level of fault is detected the sensitivity of the method will be clearly\ndemonstrated as well as its capacity for the diagnosis of very incipient\ninsulation faults.\nFigure 19 shows the results obtained during the test. In this\ngraph the sum of the electromotive forces induced in the pair of coils\ninstalled at the R-phase (VOUT ) is presented before and after applying\nthe insulation fault. The graph clearly shows an important increase in\nthis variable when the insulation fault is present.\nIf theVOUT signal is processed, a DC voltage level can be obtained\nas a severity factor that is much clearer than the visual evaluation of\nthe waveforms. The processing required is extremely simple, as only\nrectiﬁcation and low pass ﬁltering of the voltage signals are needed to\nobtain a DC voltage related to the failure level of the machine. This\nprocessing of the signal can be easily done by hardware or software. If\na software processing is applied the severity factor ∆ can be obtained\n228 Cabanas et al.\naccording to Equation (13):\n∆ = 1\nT\nT∫\n0\n|VOUT (t)| ·dt (13)\nWhich indicates ∆ can be calculated as the mean value of the\nabsolute value of the signal VOUT . Obviously, the eﬀect of this\noperation on the signal is identical to the rectifying and ﬁltering\ndescribed above: the absolute value ofVOUT is identical to the rectiﬁed\nsignal and the calculation of its mean value is equivalent to the\napplication of a low-pass ﬁlter.\n \n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2-0. 8\n-0. 6\n-0. 4\n-0. 2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n22 kV/400 V TRANSFORM ER \nUNLO ADED MACHINE \n1 SH ORTED TURN \nFAULT CURRE NT=2In  \n20ms VOUT (V) \nR- Phase coils \nFA UL TY \nHEALTHY\n \nFigure 19.

In ﬁrst place the VOUT signals obtained for\nthe healthy and faulty machine are represented. Both signals are\nthen rectiﬁed and the mean value of the rectiﬁed signals is ﬁnally\ncalculated. The graph clearly shows how the severity factor almost\nincreases a 100% when the insulation fault exists. Therefore, the\nobtained results conﬁrm the ability to detect minor insulation faults\nby simply evaluating this DC indicator. Moreover, the calculation of\n∆ is extremely easy by means of conventional integrated circuits. In\nthis way, the installation of a monitoring device in any transformer is\nstraightforward.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nBy means of the theory of the electromagnetic images an approximate\nanalytical analysis of the leakage ﬂux created by the windings of\na power transformer has been carried out. This study shows that\nleakage ﬂux distribution in three-phase transformers has a horizontal\nsymmetry axis which passes through the middle-height of the magnetic\ncore. FEM models of power transformers with diﬀerent type of\nwindings have been also designed and checked by comparing its results\nwith real laboratory measurements. By means of these models,\na complete study of the path deﬁned by leakage ﬂux lines of the\ntransformer operating at diﬀerent time instants has been carried out.\nThe results of this study demonstrate this symmetrical distribution\nis maintained at all times during the supply cycle of the machine\nindependently of the type of winding. It has also been demonstrated\nthat leakage ﬂux symmetry is automatically lost when an inter-turn\nshort-circuit exists in the transformer windings. Therefore, leakage\nﬂux can be easily applied for the early detection of this type of failure.\nBoth simulation and experimental results show that the use of two\nair core coils magnetically coupled to the transformer windings allows\ndirect, reliable and precise detection of leakage ﬂux changes. It has also\nbeen demonstrated that the combined use of two coils attached to the\nwindings surface permits the detection of a single shorted turn, even\nwhen the failure current is limited to values that are almost identical\nto the rated ones for the faulty turn.\nThe diagnosis procedure has been successfully applied to a large\nHV power transformer in which a very incipient insulation fault has\nbeen easily detected. It has also been demonstrated that very simple\nsignal processing techniques applied to the voltage induced in coils\nallow the calculation of a DC voltage value that is much higher in\nthe faulty machine than in normal operation. Therefore, an excellent,\n230 Cabanas et al.\nsensitive severity factor for this failure can be easily obtained and the\nmethod easily extended to any industrial machine.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the ﬁnancial support of the\nSpanish National Plan of Research and Development and the company\nTSK Electr´ onica y Electricidad for the development of the present\nstudy.\nREFERENCES\n1.
