These are sexually dimorphic in both their occurrence and their\neﬀects. The production of predominant HCs has been measured in male and female progeny of\n220 PGal4 lines mated with the feminising UAS-transformer transgenic strain. In 45 lines, XY ﬂies\nwere substantially or totally feminised for their HCs. Surprisingly, XX ﬂies of 14 strains were\npartially masculinised. Several of the PGal4 enhancer-trap variants screened here seem to interact\nwith sex determination mechanisms involved in the control of sexually dimorphic characters. We\nalso found a good relationship between the degree of HC transformation and GAL4 expression in\noenocytes. The fat body was also involved in the switch of sexually dimorphic cuticular\nhydrocarbons but its eﬀect was diﬀerent between the sexes.\n1. Introduction\nCuticular hydrocarbons are some of the crucial\nmolecules involved in mate recognition during court-\nship of diﬀerent species of theDrosophila melanogaster\ncomplex (Antony & Jallon, 1982; Cobb & Jallon,\n1990; Coyne et al., 1994; Cobb & Ferveur, 1996;\nFerveur, 1997; Savarit et al ., 1999; Greenspan &\nFerveur, 2000). In the model speciesD. melanogaster,\nthe predominant cuticular hydrocarbons (HCs) are\nsexually dimorphic (Fig. 1): only females produce\ndienes (HCs with two double bonds) including\npredominant cis, cis 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD;\n27 carbons) and cis, cis 7,11-nonacosadiene (7, 11-\nND; 29 carbons), whereas males produce large\namounts of monoenes (monounsaturated HCs) prin-\ncipally represented bycis 7-tricosene (7-T; 23 carbons)\nand cis 7-pentacosene (7-P; 25 carbons). D. melano-\ngaster females also produce 7-T and 7-P but in much\nsmaller amounts than do males. The predominant\nHCs of both sexes have diﬀerent eﬀects on male\ncourtship. The 7, 11-dienes strongly prevent inter-\nspeciﬁc courtship and mating, and slightly reinforces\nintraspeciﬁc precopulatory stimulation, whereas 7-T\n* Corresponding author.

Interestingly, 7-T elicits a strong\nexcitation in males of the sibling species D. simulans,\nin which there is no qualitative sexual dimorphism for\ncuticular hydrocarbons (Jallon, 1984; Coyne et al.,\n1994; Coyne & Oyama, 1995; Savarit et al., 1999).\nSexual dimorphism of the predominant HCs has\nbeen explored with several mutations that aﬀect the\ngenetic pathway controlling sexual diﬀerentiation\nduring development. Mutations in the Sex-lethal\n(Sxl), transformer (tra), transformer2 and doublesex\n(dsx) genes can switch the gender of the predominant\nHCs (Tompkins & McRobert, 1989; Tompkins &\nMcRobert, 1995; Jallon et al., 1986; Jallon et al.,\n1988). In general, the alteration of these genes led to\nan increased production of male 7-monoenes together\nwith a decrease of 7, 11-dienes in XX ﬂies. The fact\nthat these mutations had no detectable pheromonal\neﬀect on XY ﬂies suggests that mutant sex-deter-\nmination genes specify the production of male\npredominant HCs by default. Conversely, the ectopic\nexpression of the dominant Sxl, Tra (with the UAS-\ntra transgene) or Dsx female products feminised\nthe predominant HCs of XY ﬂies (Tompkins &\nMcRobert, 1989; Ferveur et al ., 1997; Waterbury\net al., 1999). Targeting of adult oenocytes (i.e. clusters\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nF. Saarit and J.-F. Fereur 24\nFig. 1. Representative mirrored gas chromatograms of\nhexane extracts of two individual ﬂies, a male (top) and a\nfemale (bottom) of the Cs strain. Each numbered peak\ncorresponds to a single hydrocarbon (HC) whose identity\nwas previously revealed by mass-spectrometry. The two\nchromatograms are to the same scale: they were aligned\nand calibrated by using an added standard of hexacosane\non each chromatogram (removed for the sake of clarity,\nand indicated by two vertical lines). All identiﬁed male\nand female HCs are listed below according to their chain-\nlength (in italics) and are given with their abbreviation\n(in brackets). 23 carbons – 1:7 ,11-tricosadiene (7,11-TD);\n2: 2-methyldocosane (23Br); 3: 9-tricosene (9-T);\n4: 7-tricosene (7-T); 5: 5-tricosene (5-T); 6: n-tricosane\n(23Lin). 25 carbons –7:7 , 11-pentacosadiene (7,11-PD);\n8: 2-methyltetracosane (25Br); 9: 9-pentacosene (9-P);\n10: 7-pentacosene (7-P); 11: 5-pentacosene (5-P);\n12: n-pentacosane (25Lin). 27 carbons – 13: 9,13-\nheptacosadiene (9,13-HD); 14: 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-\nHD); 15: 2-methylhexacosane (27Br); 16: 9-heptacosene\nof big subepidermal cells in the abdomen) by UAS-tra\ncompletely feminised HCs of XY ﬂies, suggesting that\nthese structures control the complete sexual diﬀer-\nentiation of HCs (Ferveur et al., 1997).\nHowever, the manipulation of UAS- tra has also\nrevealed that sexual transformation was not always an\n‘all-or-none’ process because XY ﬂies of many PGal4\nUAS-tra strains showed intermediate degrees of\nfeminisation (e.g. a mixture of male and female\npredominant HCs) (Ferveur & Sureau,1996). In these\nstrains, the fact that the increase in female-speciﬁc\nHCs was related to the decrease of predominant male-\nspeciﬁc HCs and ice ersa indicates that male and\nfemale hydrocarbons share common biosynthetic\npathways.\nHere, we have studied the eﬀect on HC production\nof the genetic interaction between 220 PGal4 enhancer-\ntrap strains and the dominant feminising UAS- tra\ntransgene. The production of all measurable hydrocar-\nbons was assessed in male and female ﬂies of all PGal4\nUAS-tra strains. XY ﬂies of 45 strains were largely or\ntotally feminised for their HCs, and XX ﬂies of 14\nstrains showed a partial masculinisation of their HCs.\nAll transformed strains were grouped according to\ntheir degree of feminisation and }or masculinisation.\nThen, β-galactosidase production was also compared\nbetween groups to map the tissues involved in the\nproduction and in the sexual diﬀerentiation of sex-\nspeciﬁc HCs.\n2. Materials and methods\n(i) Drosophila strains and crosses\nAll strains of D. melanogaster were kept on standard\ncornmeal and yeast medium under a 12–12 h light–\ndark cycle at 25‡ 0–5 °C. A Canton S (Cs) strain was\nused as the reference for the production of male and\nfemale HCs (Fig.1). All the other strains were derived\nfrom the cross between a PGal4 enhancer-trap strain\n(Brand & Perrimon, 1993) and either the feminising\nUAS-tra (Ferveur et al., 1995) strain or the UAS-lacZ\nstrain necessary to visualize β-galactosidase produc-\ntion (Brand & Perrimon, 1993); the UAS-lacZ strain\nwas provided by E. Giniger (Harvard, USA).\nPGal4 strains were provided by diﬀerent labora-\ntories: 7B, 8B, 10B, 13AX, 28A, 30B and 32B PGal4\nstrains were generated by A. Brand and N. Perrimon\n(Harvard, USA). The initial 28A strain was split into\nthree lines based on eye colour: 28AR (red eyes),\n28AO (orange eyes) and 28AP (purple eyes). Both 65\nand 32 1 PGal4 strains were generated in the lab-\n(9-H); 17: 7-heptacosene (7-H); 18: 5-heptacosene (5-H);\n19: n-heptacosane (27Lin). 29 carbons –2 0 :9 ,13-\nnonacosadiene (9,13-ND); 21:7 ,11-nonacosadiene (7,11-\nND); 22: 2-methyloctacosane (29Br); 23: 7-nonacosene\n(7-N); 24: n-nonacosane (29Lin).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSex-speciﬁc hydrocarbons in Drosophila 25\noratory of R. F. Stocker (Fribourg, Switzerland).\n59Y, c62 and c133 PGal4 strains were generated in the\nlaboratory of K. Kaiser (Glasgow, UK). 023, 090,\n095, 101,2 15 and 358 PGal4 strains were produced in\nthe laboratory of C. O’Kane (Cambridge, UK). The\nMZ PGal4 strains (18, 19, 97,142, 801 and 1172) were\ngenerated by J. Urban and K. Ito (Mainz, Germany).\nAll 45 Tp PGal4 strains were provided by T. Pre !at\n(Gif-sur-Yvette, France). All the strains provided by\nA. Brand, K. Kaiser and R. F. Stocker (with the\nexception of strain 321) have been described previously\n(Ferveur & Sureau, 1996). With the exception of C.\nO’Kane’s strains, which were selected on the basis of\na patchy expression in the abdomen, PGal4 strains\nwere primarily screened for restricted or absent\nexpression in the adult nervous system (Ferveuret al.,\n1995; Ferveur & Greenspan, 1998).\nIn order to ensure that F 1 progeny carried both\nPGal4 and UAS-reporter transgenes (because we did\nnot know which chromosome was carrying the PGal4\ninsert), all crosses were performed between PGal4\nfemales and UAS males. To make sure that the\nexpression of UAS-tra in tissues was responsible for\nchanges in HC proﬁles, controls were obtained from\nPGal4 UAS-lacZ ﬂies of each PGal4 line.\n(ii) Extraction and analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons\nMale and female ﬂies were sexed 0–2 h after emergence\nunder light CO # anaesthesia and aged in standard\nfood vials in groups of ten. Hydrocarbon extraction\nwas performed following standard procedure (Fer-\nveur, 1991). Brieﬂy, individual four-day-old ﬂies were\nsoaked in a microtube containing 50 µl hexane for\n10 min. After removal of the ﬂies, 20 µl of hexane\ncontaining 800 ng of hexacosane (C26; used as an\ninternal standard) was added to each microtube.\nThen, 5 µl of each sample was injected in a Perkin-\nElmer Autosystem gas phase chromatograph (GPC)\nequipped with a (25 QC2 }BP1 0,1) 25 m capillary\ncolumn with hydrogen as the carrier gas. During\nchromatography, temperature was programmed to\nincrease from180 °C to 270°C at a rate of 3°C min\n−\".\nPeak detection was carried out using a ﬂame ionization\ndetector coupled with a Chromjet integrator (Thermo\nSeparation Product) that yielded retention times and\nareas under each peak. All the D. melanogaster\npredominant HCs have already been identiﬁed and\ncharacterized (Antony & Jallon, 1982; Pechine! et al.,\n1985; Pechine! et al., 1988; Jallon & Pechine!, 1989).\nFor each ﬂy, HC production was calculated with\nthe following procedure. First, we pooled the total\namount of HCs (SumHCs) calculated with a maximum\nof 24 compounds with a chain length ranging from 23\nto 29 carbons. Each HC was characterized by its\npercentage relative to SumHCs. In addition, the area\nof each HC peak was compared with the area of the\ninternal hexacosane standard in order to calculate its\nabsolute amount (in ng).\n(iii) Hydrocarbon parameters and sexual dimorphism\nof HCs\nResults are reported as percentages rather than\nabsolute amounts because percentages are less sen-\nsitive to experimental variation. However, we are\naware that the variation of a percentage for a\npredominant molecule can result from the variation of\nanother major compound. In the previous feminis-\nation experiments, Ferveur & Sureau ( 1996) showed\nthat the decrease of male predominant 7-T was\ncorrelated with the increase of female 7,11-dienes. In\nthe present study, the ratio between predominant\nfemale and male HCs was used to map the tissues\ninvolved in their sexually dimorphic production.\nWith our chromatographic procedure, amounts of\n22–24 HCs were estimated in individual male and\nfemale ﬂies (Fig. 1). Control Cs ﬂies showed clear\nsexual dimorphism for the major compounds: 7-T\nand 7-P were predominant in males whereas high\nlevels of 7, 11-HD and 7, 11-ND were produced\nexclusively by females. The amount of 7-T and 7-P\nrepresents C65% of the total detected hydrocarbons\n(SumHCs) in control males (and !10% in control\nfemales), whereas the total 7, 11-dienes (7,11-HD›\n7,11-ND) represents C45% of SumHCs in control\nfemales.\n(iv) Histological techniques and treatment\nPatterns of GAL4 expression were visualized with the\nUAS-lacZ reporter gene, producing a blue stain after\nhistochemical reaction with X-Gal. Of all PGal4\nstrains discussed here, 55 were selected mainly on the\nbasis of their eﬀects on HC transformation: theGAL4\nexpression pattern was analysed for all the strains that\nshowed substantial HC eﬀects, whereas only a fraction\nof the strains with milder eﬀects were so analysed. For\nall strains, at least six PGal4 UAS-lacZ ﬂies of each\nsex were observed. Flies were anaesthetised, their\nwings were removed and they were placed in Tissue-\nTek2 compound. Two or three ﬂies were simul-\ntaneously placed in a small drop of Tissue-Tek that\nwas held just above liquid nitrogen for 10 sec to\nharden. Frozen blocks were trimmed and immediately\ncut into ribbons of 10 µm sections with a Leica-Jung\n3000 cryostat (at ﬁ 20 °C). Sections were ﬁxed for\n10 min in 1–5% (v }v) glutaraldehyde, 2 –0% (w }v)\nformaldehyde (from paraformaldehyde), 30% (w }v)\nsucrose, 1%( w}v) calcium chloride, 1%( w}v) gum\narabic and 0–05 M cacodylic acid at 4 °C. After two\nrinses ( 10 min) in distilled water, β-galactosidase\nactivity was revealed with a solution made with 25µl\nof a diluted solution of X-gal (8% (v }v) X-gal in\ndimethylformamide) mixed with 1 ml Fe}Na phos-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nF. Saarit and J.-F. Fereur 26\nphate buﬀer at 37 °C, in a dark room saturated with\nhumidity. In the strains studied here, GAL4 was\ngenerally revealed after 15 min to 3 h of exposure.\nSlides were rinsed twice in PBS for 10 min. Prep-\narations were then immersed in 90% glycerol, 10%\nPBS 1‹ and covered with a cover glass sealed with\ncolourless polish. All slides were observed on a Leica\nDMRB microscope equipped with a microphoto-\ngraphic system.\nWe chose to focus our study on adult expression\nbecause it was previously shown that the formation of\nsexually dimorphic HCs occurs between12 h and 48 h\nof imaginal life (Ferveur et al., 1997). Accordingly,\ndetailed GAL4 expression was followed in two- and\nfour-day-old ﬂies of the 55 PGal4 strains. Expression\nwas surveyed in all adult tissues with the help of\nMiller’s anatomical handbook (Miller, 1950). In\nparticular, oenocytes, fat body, ﬁve parts of the\ndigestive tract and the reproductive apparatus of both\nsexes were examined carefully for X-Gal staining. In\nthe case of the corpus allatum }cardiacum complex\n(CA}CC) and of other structures in the central nervous\nsystem, the presence or absence of staining was noted\nwithout further detail. The expression in some parts of\nthe gut and salivary glands was found in all strains, as\npreviously noted (Brand et al., 1994; Timmons et al.,\n1997); the expression in these tissues was used as an\ninternal standard to evaluate the strength of expression\nin tissues of interest.\n(v) Statistical tests\nWe have designed a procedure to simplify the\ncharacterization of the hydrocarbon phenotype be-\ncause of the large number of moecules (up to 24) that\nwas characterized in the 88 (or 90) strains. A principal\ncomponents analysis (PCA) was carried out to\ncompare the overall variation of each HC relative to\nthe total variation of all compounds. The PCA was\nperformed with software written by J. Rouault (Orsay,\nFrance) and allowed measurement of the level of\ncorrelation between HCs.\n3. Results\nWe surveyed the hydrocarbon production of 4-day-\nold XY and XX F 1 ﬂies resulting from the cross of\nvirgin females from 220 PGal4 strains with males\ncarrying the feminising UAS-tra transgene (Ferveuret\nal., 1995; Ferveur et al., 1997; O’Dell et al., 1995;\nFerveur & Sureau,1996; Ferveur & Greenspan,1998;\nBalakireva et al., 1998; Savarit et al., 1999).\n(i) Feminisation of HCs in XY ﬂies is not an ‘all-or-\nnone’ process\nThe feminisation of HCs occured to varying degrees\nin XY ﬂies of diﬀerent PGal4 UAS- tra strains (as\nmentioned above in Ferveur & Sureau,1996). In order\nto compare the degree of feminisation between strains,\nwe carried out a PCA that partitioned the variation of\nall detected hydrocarbons in XY PGal4 UAS-tra ﬂies\nof 88 strains, including all the strains producing\nfeminised ﬂies (Fig. 2). According to this PCA, strains\nwere distributed in three groups, each exhibiting a\ndiﬀerent dispersion pattern along both factor axes.\nStrains of group 1 were dispersed along PC 1 and\nstrains of group 3 were dispersed along PC 2, whereas\nstrains of group 2 showed a wider dispersion along\nboth axes.\nThe levels of male and female HCs found on the\ntransformed males were highly and positively corre-\nlated within each ‘gender group’ of HCs, whereas they\nwere highly and negatively correlated between male\nand female groups of HCs (data not shown). This\nmarked gender bipolarity allowed us to select a\nunique female-speciﬁc HC (7, 11-HD) and a unique\nmale-predominant HC (7-T) to simplify our approach.\nThe 7,11-HD:7-T ratio was deﬁned as the ‘feminis-\nation index’ (Fi) providing a single parameter to\ncharacterize the HC phenotype and to compare the\ndegree of feminisation in XY PGal4 UAS-tra ﬂies of\ndiﬀerent PGal4 strains.\nThe HC proﬁle of males from the 88 strains that\nwere analysed with the PCA is shown in Fig. 3 (with\nthe reference proﬁle of control male and female ﬂies\nshown on top). In group 1 (19 strains), the Fi of XY\nPGal4 UAS-tra ﬂies ranged between 86–7 (for Tp3502\nstrain) and 2–19 (for10B strain). This high variation of\nFi was mainly caused by the variation of 7-T (peak 4),\nwhose percentage varied between 0–3% and 11–1%o f\nSumHCs. The mean absolute amounts of 7-T ranged\nbetween 5 ng and 158 ng. By comparison, control Cs\nfemales produced 59 ‡ 5n g o f 7 - T ( 3–3%). The\npercentage of 7, 11-HD (peak 14) varied between\n19–5% and 32–4%, with absolute amounts of between\n263 ng and 509 ng (for Cs females, 466‡ 33 ng, which\nis 25–4%). Males of group1 generally produced more\n7-P (peak 10) than 7-T. The absolute level of 7-P\nranged between 4 1 ng and 220 ng (3– 11–6%). By\ncomparison, control females produced 97‡ 7n go f7 - P\n(5–3%). Feminised males of group1 always produced\nless 7, 11-ND (peak 2 1; 72–236 ng, which is 5 –1–\n14–8%) than control Cs females (328‡ 21 ng, which is\n18%). In these feminised males, the SumHCs varied\nbetween 1118 ng and 1945 ng ( 1827‡ 117n g i n\ncontrol females).\nXY ﬂies of group 2 (26 strains) showed an inter-\nmediate degree of feminisation ( 1–90!Fi!0–30).\nTheir mean levels of 7-T were 8–24–2% (127–476 ng)\nand mean levels of 7, 11-HD were 7 –2–19–5% (95–\n404 ng). These ﬂies also produced more 7-P ( 148–\n468 ng, which is 12–6–21–2%) and less 7, 11-ND\n(6–57 ng, which is 0 –5–4–3%) than ﬂies of group 1.\nTheir SumHCs ranged between1101 ng and 2256 ng.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSex-speciﬁc hydrocarbons in Drosophila 27\nFig. 2.

Each individual ﬂy was represented according to its proportion of 7,11-HD (x axis) and 7-T (y axis).\nOn the top, the distribution of individuals is shown for all ﬂies of each of the three groups: group 2 shows the highest\nvariability. The distribution of individuals for each strain of group 2 are shown below. According to their range of\nproportions of 7,11-HD and 7-T variability, they were assigned to subgroups A, B or C (between brackets).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSex-speciﬁc hydrocarbons in Drosophila 3 1\nIn group 3 (43 strains), XY ﬂies produced high\nlevels of 7-T (241–957 ng, which is 23–1–42–1%), and\ngenerally very low amounts of (or no) 7, 11-HD\n(!30 ng, which is !6–8%). Although the Fi of all\nthese strains was !0–30, males of some strains\n(Tp3151,T p1236, Tp4852, 113, 194, 235 and Tp331)\nstill produced a substantial amount of 7, 11-HD\n(maximum of136 ng) that was compensated (in the Fi\nratio) by an high level of 7-T (\"650 ng). 7-P varied\nbetween 16–3% and 36 –1% (222–594 ng), whereas\n7,11-ND was either very reduced (23 ng, which is\n!1–1%) or absent in group 3 males. The SumHCs\nvaried between 998 ng and 235 1 ng. The ‘non-\nfeminised’ males of group 3 included some strains\nwith ‘slightly feminised’ males because, in most of the\nlatter strains, the results were biased by a few\nindividuals (or even by a single male), such that the\ndegree of feminisation was not predictable in these\nstrains. Male progeny from132 other PGal4 UAS-tra\nlines yielded HC proﬁles that were very similar to the\ncontrol male pattern (data not shown).\n(ii) Intrastrain ariation in the degree of feminisation\nWe previously noted that the strains composing groups\n1 and 3 exhibited much less dispersion along the PCA\naxes than strains of group 2. Graphs of 7-T and 7,11-\nHD percentages of individual ﬂies (top of Fig. 4)\nindicate that there was also less variability in these\nHCs within strains of groups1 and 3 than in those of\ngroup 2. The overall dispersion of group 2 individuals\nwas very wide and overlapped extensively with the\ndistributions of groups 1 and 3. In group 2, the\nintrastrain variability revealed three subgroups of\nstrains according to the dispersion of individual Fi\nvalues. Fig. 4 shows that the type of dispersion seems\nto be independent of the Fi value (the strains with\nhigher Fis are ranked on the left from the top; strain\nTp4778 had the highest Fi, and strain 2 15 had the\nlowest Fi).\nStrains in subgroup 2A (Tp4778, MZ 19, Tp4240,\nTp5712, Tp2516, Tp216 and Tp4361 strains) exhibited\nless dispersion than other subgroups. The range of\nvariability in the proportion of 7, 11-HD did not\nexceed 10–12%, whereas the range of variability in\nthe proportion of 7-T did not exceed 15–18%. In\nstrains of subgroup 2B (8B, 13AX, 101,T p 1625,\nTp833 and Tp4063), the dispersion of variability in\nthe proportions of both 7,11-HD and 7-T among ﬂies\nof each strain was wider than among ﬂies of subgroup\nA strains, but their range of variability rarely exceeded\n18% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, these six\nstrains had very similar Fi values (0–71–0–30). In the13\nstrains forming subgroup 2C, the range of variability\nin the proportions of 7, 11-HD and 7-T generally\nexceeded 30%. In three strains of subgroup 2C (30B,\n090 and, to a lesser extent, 321), the variability in the\nproportion of 7-T, but not of 7, 11-HD, was very\nreduced: the value of their regression slope (ﬁ 0–26 to\nﬁ 0–33) was much smaller than that of all the other\nstrains (ﬁ 0–44 to ﬁ 1–98, except for strain Tp436 1\n(0–08), which had a very narrow distribution). There-\nfore, the variation of percentages for male- and\nfemale-speciﬁc HCs was not correlated in these three\nstrains. In the ten other strains of subgroup 2C, the\nregression slope indicates that the variability in the\nproportions of both 7,11-HD and 7-T were negatively\nrelated. We also observed a similar negative re-\nlationship between female and male predominant\nHCs in most strains of groups 1 and 3.\n(iii) Masculinisation of hydrocarbons in genetically\nfeminised females\nWe obtained an unexpected hydrocarbon phenotype\nin females of 14 PGal4 UAS- tra lines (out of 220)\nbecause these XX ﬂies showed a decreased proportion\nof 7,11-HD together with an increased proportion of\n7-T, corresponding to a substantial masculinisation of\nHCs (Fig. 5). Masculinisation of HCs in XX ﬂies was\nstudied with a procedure similar to the one used to\nstudy feminisation in XY ﬂies (see above). The\nvariation of all detected HCs in XX ﬂies of 90 PGal4\nUAS-tra strains (87 of the 88 strains shown above plus\nthree 28A strains that yielded only XX progeny) was\nanalysed by PCA (Fig. 5). The sum of the two\nprincipal components represents almost 90% of the\ntotal variation (74% for the ﬁrst component and\n15–8% for the second). The masculinised strains were\nclearly separated from non-masculinised strains along\nPC 1. However, no obvious diﬀerence of dispersion\nalong the PC 2 was noted between masculinised and\nnon-masculinised strains.\nUnlike the feminisation experiment, the amounts of\n7-T and 7-P, on one hand, and those of 7,11-HD and\nof 7,11-ND, on the other, were not highly correlated\n(data not shown). For this reason, the levels of these\nfour substances were taken in account to calculate the\nmasculinisation index (Mi).\nMiﬂ\n([7-T› 7-P]ﬁ [7,11-HD› 7,11-ND])\n([7-T› 7-P]› [7,11-HD› 7,11-ND])\nThe Mi was used empirically to separate PGal4\nstrains into two groups according to the degree of\nmasculinisation of their XX PGal4 UAS- tra ﬂies. A\ncut-oﬀ Mi value of ﬁ 0–45 allowed the separation of\nstrains with masculinised females from strains with\nnon-masculinised females (Fig. 6). 14 PGal4 strains\n(including two ‘intermediate’ strains, 28AR and 023)\nwere masculinised and formed the M group. If we ex-\nclude the two intermediate strains and consider only\n12 strains, the Mi values of XX ﬂies varied between\n› 0–69 (for the highest degree of masculinisation) and\nﬁ 0–19. They produced between 7–4% and 34–3% of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nF. Saarit and J.-F. Fereur 32\nFig. 5. The degree of HC masculinisation varies between XX ﬂies of diﬀerent PGal4 UAS- tra lines. The degree of masculinisation of XX ﬂies was compared between 90\nPGal4 UAS-tra strains with a PCA. Principal components 1 and 2 represent 74% and 15–8%, respectively, of the HC variability. Ellipses were drawn to delineate most\nstrains belonging either to the group with masculinised females (M group) or to the group without masculinised females.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSex-speciﬁc hydrocarbons in Drosophila 33\nFig. 6. Histograms of complete HC proﬁles in XX ﬂies of 38 PGal4 UAS-tra strains. Strains were separated into two groups following the\nPCA shown in Fig. 5. However, strains with masculinised females (M group) were split into two subgroups depending upon their\nmasculinisation index (Mi): 12 masculinised lines and two intermediate lines. We decided not to show the proﬁle for all 77 strains without\nmasculinised females but only a sample including most of the strains with feminised XY ﬂies. Mi values determined for PGal4‹ UAS-lacZ\nXX ﬂies were similar to those for Cs females. For further detail, see Fig. 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nF. Saarit and J.-F. Fereur 34\nFig. 7. Intrastrain variability for production of predominant female and male HCs in XX ﬂies of various PGal4 UAS-\ntra strains. Each individual ﬂy was represented according to its proportion of 7,11 dienes (x axis) and 7-monoenes (y\naxis). On the top, individual variability is shown for each of the two groups: the group with non-masculinised females\nwith a unimodal distribution and the group with masculinised females (M group), which exhibits the highest variability.\nIntrastrain distribution for all masculinised strains is shown below. The two intermediate strains (with the mildest\nmasculinisation eﬀect) are shown on the bottom.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSex-speciﬁc hydrocarbons in Drosophila 35\n7,11-dienes (7,11-HD› 7,11-ND), corresponding to\n108–997 ng. Therefore, female-speciﬁc molecules\nnever completely disappeared even in the most\nextreme cases of masculinisation (as in Tp5670 and\nTp2471 strains). In the same XX ﬂies, the proportion\nof 7-T varied between 3–1% and17–2%( 113–333 ng),\nwhereas the proportion of 7-P varied between 7 –9%\nand 25 –7% (224–608 ng). SumHCs varied between\n1431 ng and 2281 ng, except for 28AO- and 28AP-tra\nfemales (24 16 ng and 28 16 ng, respectively). Both\nintermediate strains (023 and 28AR) had very low Mi\nvalues ( ﬁ 0–41 and ﬁ 0–36). However, they were\nincluded in the M group because their XX ﬂies\nproduced very high amounts of male 7-monoenes\n(7-T› 7-Pﬂ 337 ng and 467 ng, respectively). The\nhigh amount of 7, 11-dienes (798 ng and 997 ng)\nproduced by these ﬂies explain the relatively low Mi.\nXX progeny from the 76 other PGal4 UAS-tra lines\nproduced HCs in amounts very similar to those of\ncontrol Cs females. In that group of strains, the\nproportion of 7,11-dienes varied between 30–3% and\n45–8% (536– 1136 ng), the proportion of 7-T varied\nbetween 0–7% and 5–1%, and the proportion of 7-P\nvaried between 2% and 6 –1%. The total amount of\n7-T› 7-P was generally!200 ng and SumHCs varied\nbetween 1400 ng and 2562 ng.\n(iv) Intrastrain ariation for the degree of\nmasculinisation\nThe wide dispersion of the strains of the M group on\nboth PCA axes (Fig. 5) indicates that the degree of\nmasculinisation varied. Similarly to the approach\ncarried out to study feminisation of male HCs (see\nabove; Fig. 4), we measured the variability of\nmasculinised HCs by examining intrastrain distri-\nbutions in graphs of the proportion of 7-monoenes\nagainst the proportion of 7,11-dienes. The dispersion\nof individuals clearly diﬀers between ‘masculinised’\nand ‘non-masculinised’ groups (top of Fig. 7): the\nHC phenotype of ‘non-masculinised’ females is rather\nhomogenous whereas individuals of strains producing\n‘masculinised’ females can exhibit a wide variety of\nHC phenotypes, ranging from normal female to\nnormal male proﬁles.\nThe comparison of the 14 ‘M’ strains revealed\ndiﬀerent distribution patterns (as for feminised males\nof group 2): Tp4778-, Tp2471- and Tp1573-tra females\nshowed relatively unimodal distributions (with a single\nindividual being the exception in the two latter strains).\nTp4778-tra females produced an intersexual HC\nmixture (23 –7% 7-T › 7-P and 16–4% 7, 11-dienes),\nwhereas most Tp2471- and Tp1573-tra females were\nvery masculinised for their predominant HCs (41–8%\nand 28–5% of 7-monoenes for only 7–4% and 6–7%of\n7,11-dienes, respectively).\nThe other M strains showed widely dispersed\ndistributions, with phenotypes that stretched between\nmale and female HC phenotypes. Although the\napparent diﬀerence between bimodal and continuous\ndistributions might result from a sampling artefact,\nthe phenotypic heterogeneity within most of these M\nstrains was very marked: some females exhibited\nmale-like HCs and others showed a female-like proﬁle.\nFurthermore, the extreme amplitude of masculinis-\nation varied: for example, females of Tp4778-, c133-\nand 32B-tra strains never showed a strong male-like\nphenotype. In conclusion, the UAS- tra transgene\nmasculinised female HCs in some PGal4 lines, but\nwith varying degrees of sexual transformation.\n(v) Correlation between the sexual transformation of\nHCs and GAL4 expression\nIn order to map the diﬀerent tissues involved in the\nprocess of sexual maturation of HCs, we studied the\ncorrelation between the degree of HC transformation\n(feminisation in males }masculinisation in females)\nand GAL4 expression. GAL4 expression (charac-\nterized with lacZ staining) was compared in 2- and\n4-day-old male and female ﬂies; we report results for\n4-day-old ﬂies (Table 1) because no signiﬁcant age\neﬀects were detected (except in males of the 2 15\nstrain). However, sexually dimorphic expression pat-\nterns were observed in many strains (Table 1).\nExpression was compared between four groups of\nPGal4 strains: the group producing masculinised\nfemales (the M group; Fig. 5) and the three groups\ndeﬁned by their eﬀects on the feminisation of male\nHCs (Fig. 2). All the strains that belonged to the M\ngroup were excluded from the three feminising groups\n(which were thus noted as groups 1\n-M,2 -M and 3-M).\nCareful attention was speciﬁcally paid to all structures\nknown to be relevant to HC biosynthesis and }or\nmaturation (see Material and Methods). A strain was\ncounted ‘positive’ for a particular structure when\nGAL4 expression was repeatedly detected in at least\none sex.\nThe data in Table1 clearly support the ﬁnding that\nadult oenocytes are involved in the sexual trans-\nformation of HCs under the control of the sex-\ndetermination gene transformer (Ferveur et al., 1997).\nAll strains with substantially feminised PGal4- tra\nmales (groups 1\n-M and 2 -M) and with masculinised\nPGal4-tra females (M group) showed GAL4 expres-\nsion in the oenocytes of 4-day-old ﬂies. The only\nexception to this rule was the Tp4361 strain (of group\n2\n-M), in which no oenocyte expression was detected.\nMoreover, no qualitative diﬀerence of expression was\ndetected between dorsal and ventral oenocytes, or\nbetween oenocytes of diﬀerent segments. Conversely,\noenocyte expression was detected only in one strain of\ngroup 3\n-M (Tp1236), and only in males of this strain.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nF.

Strains of group 2 were ranked by subgroup order (A, B and C, as indicated between\nbrackets).\nThe strength of GAL4 expression visualized with the UAS-lacZ histological marker transgene in each main anatomical structure of XY, PGal4 UAS- lacZ ﬂies is indicated as\nfollows: ‘› ’, strong; ‘ﬁ ’, weak; blank, no expression detected.

Saarit and J.-F. Fereur 38\nGAL4 expression was never observed in the oenocytes\nof any strain with an untransformed HC proﬁle (130\nstrains examined; data not shown).\nA lower frequency ofGAL4 expression was seen in\nboth the head and the thoracic fat body (FB) of\nstrains with transformed ﬂies: 40% and 48%,\nrespectively, of strains in groups 1\n-M and 2 -M, and\n73–82% of M-group strains. Expression was generally\ncorrelated in both FB parts. Conversely, no strain in\ngroup 3\n-M showed GAL4 expression in the head and\nthoracic FB. However, in these strains, GAL4 ex-\npression was also infrequently detected in the oeno-\ncytes. GAL4 expression was frequently detected\n(76–91%) in the abdominal FB of all groups,\nsuggesting that these abdominal structures do not\nstrongly inﬂuence HC phenotype.\nWe did not observe any signiﬁcant relationship\nbetween the transformation of HCs and GAL4\nexpression in the muscular, nervous or digestive\nsystems, nor in the main structures composing the\nmale and female reproductive systems. The high\nfrequency (71%) of staining in male accessory glands\nin group 3\n-M strains is probably the result of a\nsampling artefact (5 }7 positive strains). Finally, the\nfact that very few strains expressed GAL4 in the\nCA}CC complex allows us to eliminate a possible role\nof tra in this structure, which is a priori potentially\nrelated to the sexual maturation of HCs.\nAmong the enhancer-trap strains that revealed\nsexually dimorphic expression (see brackets in Table\n1), several strains showed sex-speciﬁc expression in\nthe adult oenocytes: in group 1\n-M, one strain was\nfemale speciﬁc (Tp 1960) and another male speciﬁc\n(Tp5192R); three male-speciﬁc ( 13AX, Tp833, 59Y)\nand three female-speciﬁc (Tp25 16, 8B, c62) strains\nwere found in group 2 -M; and one male-speciﬁc (Tp\n1236) strain was found in group 3 -M. If none was\nfound in group M, the 023 strain showed a quantitative\ndiﬀerence. Several strains showed sex-speciﬁc ex-\npression in the FB: the c62 strain was the only female-\nspeciﬁc strain expressingGAL4 in the complete FB (in\nthis strain, expression was also female speciﬁc in the\noenocytes and male speciﬁc in the oesophagus). The\nTp956 and 65 strains expressed GAL4 speciﬁcally in\nmales in the three parts of the FB and in other various\nstructures. Four other strains (MZ 97, Tp833, Tp2165\nand Tp2471) showed male-speciﬁc expression in head\nand thoracic (but not in abdominal) FBs. Several\nother PGal4 strains showed sex-speciﬁc expression in\nother various structures (Table 1).\n4. Discussion\nHere, we have shown that sexually dimorphic hydro-\ncarbons (HCs), which play a crucial role in the\nmechanism of mate recognition and sexual isolation,\nare not controlled in an ‘all-or-none manner’ in ﬂies\nof both sexes. We believe that the degree of HC\ntransformation depends upon the level of – or the\nnumber of crucial cells that produce – the Tra female\nproduct. Indeed, GAL4 expression was strongly\ndetected in the oenocytes of all masculinised strains\n(14 strains of group M) and of 16 out of 17 highly\nfeminised strains (group 1\n-M), whereas it was weaker\nand less frequently detected in the oenocytes of the\nintermediate group of feminisation (group 2\n-M) than in\nthe former two groups. XY ﬂies with no GAL4\nexpression in adult oenocytes were poorly or not\nfeminised. However, the quantitative level of GAL4\nexpression in the oenocytes remains diﬃcult to\nmeasure. The correlation between oenocytes and HC\nfeminisation in XY ﬂies was very high (there was only\na single exception), but the correlation between HC\nmasculinisation and GAL4 expression in both oeno-\ncytes and the FB had several exceptions: c133 (in the\nM group) had no expression in the FB, whereas the\nTp994, Tp 1306 and Tp3470 strains (in group 1)\nexpressed GAL4 in both the oenocytes and the FB.\nThis discrepancy could be caused by a variation in the\nlevel or pattern ofGAL4 expression in both structures.\nWe are as yet unable to explain why the head and\nthoracic FBs, but not the abdominal FB, can aﬀect\nthe hydrocarbon proﬁle.\nIf a very low variability of HC amounts was\ndetected in highly feminised XY ﬂies (group1 strains),\nstrains of group 2 showed a wider variability. In the\nlatter group, strains of subgroups A and B showed\nrelatively homogeneous HC patterns that could be\ncaused by an incomplete but constant GAL4 ex-\npression in some of the tissue(s) that control the HC\nmaturation. Conversely, the extreme dispersion of the\nHC phenotypes characterizing the strains of subgroup\nC could result from subtle variations (in a tissue or\nduring development), allowing the level of Tra\nexpression to ﬂuctuate around a crucial threshold,\nand would be suﬃcient to switch the gender of the HC\nproﬁle.\nWhy do the dominant feminising UAS- tra trans-\ngenes masculinise the production of predominant\nhydrocarbons in XX ﬂies? It is known that both the\nexcess and the default amount of product of major sex\ndetermination genes induce a similar mutational eﬀect\non sex-speciﬁc characters (Parkhurst & Meneely,\n1994; Jinks et al., 2000). The HC masculinisation in\nXX ﬂies described here results from an excess of\nfemale Tra product and resembles that induced by the\nabsence of the female product in XX ﬂies (where\nseveral sex determination mutants produced mascu-\nlinised HCs) (Tompkins & McRobert, 1989; Tomp-\nkins & McRobert, 1995; Jallon et al., 1986; Jallon et\nal., 1988). Furthermore, it is possible that the\nmodiﬁcation of tra expression deregulates the activity\nof target genes likedoublesex that control hydrocarbon\nbiosynthesis (Waterbury et al., 1999). Therefore, the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0016672301005481 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSex-speciﬁc hydrocarbons in Drosophila 39\noverexpression of the female Tra product in crucial\ncells (of the oenocytes and }or of the FB) could\nderegulate the enzymatic balance that controls the\nproduction of female-speciﬁc HCs in XX ﬂies.\nUnfortunately, there is no available tool to diﬀer-\nentiate in situ female- and male-speciﬁc Tra products\n(Tian & Maniatis, 1993).\nAnother ﬁnding also concerns sexual determination.\nThe strains with masculinised XX ﬂies also showed an\neﬀect on feminisation of their XY ﬂies, but there was\na negative relationship between the degree of HC\nfeminisation and the degree of masculinisation (in the\nsame strains). Among the 11 M-tra strains that\nproduced male and female progeny (the three 28A-tra\nlines were excluded), the three strains that exhibited\nthe most extreme masculinised HC proﬁles (Tp2471,\nTp5670 and Tp 1573) had the least feminised males\n(group 3), whereas the only M strain with an\nintermediate Mi (023) had highly feminised males. It\nis possible that the feminised HC phenotype results\nfrom the conjugated eﬀects of feminisation and\nmasculinisation in XY ﬂies. In other words, the\namount of female HCs in XY ﬂies would be greatly\ndecreased if a high level of masculinisation sim-\nultaneously occurred, implying that masculinisation\nand feminisation can act additively in the same ﬂy.\nThe sexual diﬀerence in the degree of HC trans-\nformation could also be explained by the fact that\nfeminisation in XY ﬂies depends only on the ex-\npression of the UAS- tra transgene in the adult\noenocytes (Ferveur et al., 1997), whereas masculinis-\nation in XX ﬂies requires the simultaneous expression\nof UAS-tra in the FB and in the oenocytes.\nFinally, our results suggest that the HC phenotype\ncould be sensitive enough to detect alteration of the\nsex determination pathway. Therefore, the precise\ncharacterisation of this sexually dimorphic phenotype\nafter ectopic expression of UAS-tra would be an easy\nand powerful approach to screen new enhancer-trap\nstrains that interact with the sex determination\npathway. If most PGal4 ‹ UAS-tra strains with\nfeminising eﬀects are not useful for such a screen\n(because they only use the potential of the enhancer-\ntrap to misexpress Tra in crucial tissues), we suspect\nthat the genes of the 13 enhancer-trap strains\ncomposing subgroup 2C interfere with some of the\nsexually dimorphic mechanisms involved in sex phero-\nmone production: the six strains labelled ‘M(2C)’\n(top of Table 1) produced a marked eﬀect in the HC\ntransformation in both sexes, whereas the other seven\nstrains (labelled 2\n-M(C)) revealed a sexually dimorphic\nexpression in their oenocytes and }or in their FB,\nstructures that are likely to be involved in the sexual\nmaturation of HCs. We believe that, in the M(2C)\nstrains, the targeted genes and}or tissues interact with\ntra, because they alter the production of a sexually\ndimorphic character (HCs) in both sexes. In the 2\n-M(C)\nstrains, the sexually dimorphic expression occurs in\nthe oenocytes and}or FB, which are the crucial tissues\nfor sex-speciﬁc HCs. Therefore, the intermediate\nmixtures of HCs could be related to the partial\nalteration of sex-speciﬁc mechanisms in the oenocytes,\nFB and, possibly, other tissues. It is likely that the\nsexual maturation of the HC phenotype depends on\ncomplex regulatory interactions similar to those\ncontrolling sexually dimorphic abdominal pigmen-\ntation (Kopp et al., 2000).\nOur future work will aim to identify the genetic and\nmolecular mechanisms intrinsic to the oenocytes and\nto the FB that switch the production of sex-speciﬁc\nhydrocarbons.\nWe would like to thank J.
