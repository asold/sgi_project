Hillier-Brown 2,6,7,8\nAbstract\nPhysical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) of pre-school aged children are associated with important health\nand developmental outcomes. Accurate measurement of these behaviours in young children is critical for research\nand practice in this area. The aim of this review was to examine the validity, reliability, and feasibility of measurement\ntools used to assess PA and SB of pre-school aged children.\nSearches of electronic databases, and manual searching, were conducted to identify articles that examined the\nmeasurement properties (validity, reliability or feasibility) of measurement tools used to examine PA and/or SB of pre-\nschool aged children (3 – 7 years old). Following screening, data were extracted and risk of bias assessment completed\non all included articles.\nA total of 69 articles, describing 75 individual studies were included. Studies asse ssed measurement tools for\nPA ( n = 27), SB ( n = 5), and both PA and SB ( n = 43). Outcome measures of PA and SB differed between\nstudies (e.g. moderate to vigorous activity, step cou nt, posture allocation). Most studies examined the\nmeasurement properties of one measurement tool only ( n = 65). Measurement tools examined included:\ncalorimetry, direct observation, combined heart rate and accelerometry, heart rate monitors, accelerometers,\npedometers, and proxy report (parent, carer or teacher reported) measures (questionnaires or diaries). Studies\nmost frequently assessed the validity (criterion and convergent) ( n =6 5 ) , f a c e a n d c o n t e n t v a l i d i t y (n =2 ) ,\ntest-retest reliability ( n = 10) and intra-instrument reliability ( n = 1 )o ft h em e a s u r e m e n tt o o l s .F e a s i b i l i t yd a t a\nwas abstracted from 41 studies.\nMultiple measurement tools used to measure PA and SB in pre-school aged children showed some degree of\nvalidity, reliability and feasibility, but often for diff erent purposes.

Evidence of the import-\nance of these associations in pre-school aged children\nhas been a relatively recent area of research enquiry\nand is still emerging [ 4– 7]. A pre-school aged child\nrefers to any child who has not yet reached the age\nof formal schooling, usually aged between 3 and 5\nyears old but varies internationally [ 8]. The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) [ 9] recommend that pre-\nschool aged children should spend at least 180 mi-\nnutes per day in a variety of physical activities, of\nwhich 60 minutes should include moderate to vigor-\nous PA (MVPA). Recommendations for SB suggest\nthat children should not be sedentary for extended\nperiods of time, should not be restrained (such as in\nap r a m )f o rm o r et h a n6 0 m i n u t e sa tat i m e ,a n d\nshould engage in no more than 60 minutes of seden-\ntary screen time per day. The WHO guidelines also\nsuggest that when sedentary, pre-school aged children\nshould engage in activities such as reading and story-\ntelling [ 9]. Although estimates of guideline adherence\nvary in the literature, there is evidence to suggest that\nhigh proportions of pre-school aged children meet\nthe 180 minutes PA guideline [ 10– 12], but do not al-\nways engage in 60 minutes of MVPA [ 12]. Addition-\nally, pre-school aged children are thought to spend\nextensive periods of their day sedentary [ 13, 14], and\noften do not meet the 60 minutes screen time guide-\nline [ 10, 11, 13].\nIt is crucial to monitor PA and SB in pre-school aged\nchildren in response to changes in national and local\npolicy; to survey guideline adherence; to develop appro-\npriate policies and programmes; and to establish the effi-\ncacy of interventions and initiatives aimed at changing\nthese behaviours [ 15, 16]. The measurement of PA and\nSB using quality tools which have optimal measurement\nproperties, including validity, reliability and feasibility,\nare fundamental as they underpin research and practice\nin this area [ 15, 16]. However, there are no clear and up-\nto-date recommendations, or guidance, on the best tools\nto measure PA and SB in pre-school aged children.\nPA and SB can be measured using various tools (or\nmethods) including proxy report measures (question-\nnaires/diaries), device-based measurement tools (e.g. ac-\ncelerometers, pedometers, heart rate monitors, combined\nheart rate and accelerometry), direct observation and mea-\nsures of energy expenditure (e.g. doubly labelled water\n(DLW) and whole room calorimetry). Selecting the best\nquality tool to use for a particular purpose in any age\ngroup can be difficult [ 17] and there are additional and\nspecific issues to consider for pre-school aged children.\nThese include the more sporadic and intermittent nature\nof their movement [ 18], reduced cognitive capabilities\nwhich limit the ability to recall their own behaviour [ 19],\nand the increased likelihood that they will tamper with\ndevice based measurement tools [ 20].\nExisting reviews have examined the measurement\nproperties of selected measurement tools used to assess\nPA and SB in children [ 16, 21– 25], including those\nwhich focused specifically on questionnaire based mea-\nsures [ 26– 29]. However, these reviews did not examine\nthe full range of measurement tools used to assess PA\nand SB, and did not focus specifically on pre-school aged\nchildren.\nIn 2007, Oliver and colleagues, conducted a review\nexamining prevalence and measurement issues in asses-\nsing the PA of pre-school aged children [ 19]. The au-\nthors summarised studies that had examined the validity\nand reliability of a range of measurement tools used to\nassess PA of young children; however, a rapid scoping\nsearch of relevant studies that we conducted prior to the\nreview presented here, identified a large number of po-\ntential studies for inclusion that were published after\nOliver et al ’s review. Further, this review did not exam-\nine SB: the most likely reason for this is that the import-\nant associations of SB with health and developmental\noutcomes, independent of PA, have only started to\nemerge in the last 10 – 15 years [ 6, 7, 30].\nTherefore, the aim of the present review was to exam-\nine the validity, reliability, and feasibility, of measure-\nment tools used to assess PA and SB in pre-school aged\nchildren.\nMethods\nThis systematic review is reported in accordance with\nthe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\nand Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria [ 31] (see Add-\nitional file 1). The protocol for this systematic review\nwas registered at the International Prospective Register\nfor Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration num-\nber CRD42019133613.\nPhillips et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2021) 18:141 Page 2 of 28\nSearch strategy\nSystematic searches of seven major electronic databases\n(Scopus, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO,\nMEDLINE, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus); topic specific\njournals: Journal for the Measurement of Physical Be-\nhaviour and Pediatric Exercise Science; and the grey\nliterature (opengrey.eu and Research Gate), were con-\nducted to identify relevant studies. Searches were con-\nducted in March 2019, and updated in March 2020.\nNo restrictions were placed on language, year of study\nor publication status.\nThe search strategy included combinations of the: con-\nstruct (physical activity, sedentary, sitting), population\n(pre-school, early years, early childhood, young children\nand kindergarten) and measurement properties (assess-\nment, measurement, method, valid, reliable, feasible).\nSearches were adapted to each database, alongside the\nuse of appropriate boolean operators and database spe-\ncific filters (see Additional file 2). The lead review author\n(SMP) worked with the Durham University information\nscience team, to refine the search strategies. References\nand citation searches of included studies, as well as\nchecking the reference lists of selected existing reviews\n[16, 19, 21– 29] were conducted for completeness.\nEligibility criteria for included studies\nStudies were eligible for inclusion if their aim was to\nexamine the measurement properties (validity and/or re-\nliability and/or feasibility) of a tool used to measure PA\nand/or SB of a general population sample of pre-school\naged children between the ages of 3 and 7 years old.\nTable 1 provides an overview of the definitions of meas-\nurement properties that were examined in this review.\nThere remains some debate over the terminology used\nfor validity in the field of PA and SB measurement, par-\nticularly in relation to criterion validity [ 32]. For the pur-\npose of this review, we developed a level of evidence\nscheme to distinguish between validity studies that used\ndifferent comparison measurement tools. Level 1 in-\ncludes criterion validity studies; the only methods con-\nsidered ‘criterion’ were calorimetry based methods (e.g.\nwhole room calorimetry and DLW) when compared\nagainst a measurement tool aiming to measure energy\nexpenditure. Levels 2 – 4 include convergent validity, sep-\narated by the quality of the comparison measurement\ntool used. Level 2 includes studies where a tool has been\ncompared against a measure which is considered to have\nrelatively high validity (but not criterion), such as direct\nobservation. Level 3 includes studies where a tool has\nbeen compared against a measure which is considered to\nhave relatively low validity, such as device based meas-\nurement tools.

Table 2 provides a full explanation on\nwhat constitutes each level of evidence.\nStudies were excluded if:\na) The aim of the study was not to examine the\nmeasurement properties of the tool.

For example, studies were\nexcluded if their aim was to examine physical\nfitness, motor skills, PA environment, correlates of\nPA or SB, or the impact of interventions;\nc) The study included children under 3 years or over\n7 years of age, or if the population sample included\nchildren with chronic conditions;\nd) The study was a study protocol or a review. Higher\ndegree theses and conference abstracts were\nincluded, however, where the relevant information\nfrom the theses were also provided in published\npeer-reviewed journal articles, the journal article\nwas included and the thesis excluded.\nScreening for relevant studies to include in the review\nFollowing the searches, all identified articles were\nimported into a referencing manager software (Endnote\nX9.1) and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts\nof included articles were screened by the lead review au-\nthor (SMP) for inclusion, with a further 10% screened by\na second reviewer (MH). There was very high agreement\nbetween the two reviewers for title and abstract screen-\ning, with a Cohen ’s kappa statistic [ 37]o f k = 0.94. Any\ndisagreement on the eligibility of particular studies was\nresolved through discussion, without the need for escal-\nation to a third reviewer (FCHB). Full texts of potentially\nrelevant studies were then double screened by two re-\nviewers (SMP, MH, and/or FCHB) for inclusion.\nData extraction of individual studies included in the\nreview\nData from all relevant studies were extracted independ-\nently by two data extractors (SMP, CM, and/or FCHB)\nusing a pre-piloted data extraction form. Any discrepan-\ncies were resolved by discussion. Extracted information\nincluded: study characteristics, participant characteris-\ntics, the measurement tool explored (e.g. accelerometry),\nthe measurement tool(s) used as a comparison, data in-\nterpretation choices for device based measurement tools\n(e.g. cut points, epoch, placement), statistical method\nused to compare measurement tools, behaviour category\n(PA and/or SB), and the details of the units of measure\n(e.g. moderate-to-vigorous PA), measurement properties\nassessed (e.g. criterion validity), the results of the study,\nand the sources of funding for the study.\nRisk of bias assessment of individual studies included in\nthe review\nRisk of bias assessment was conducted independently by\ntwo reviewers (SMP, FCHB), with any discrepancies re-\nsolved through discussion. The risk of bias of all individ-\nual studies included in this review was assessed using a\nmodified version of the Downs and Black Checklist, a\nmethod suitable for appraising non-randomised studies\n[38]. This modified checklist has been successfully used\nin previous systematic reviews examining PA assessment\nmeasures [ 21, 39]. The tool includes seventeen ques-\ntions: eight focus on the quality of reported criteria,\nthree on the external validity and five the internal valid-\nity. The maximum quality score a study could receive\nwas 17, with study quality rated as good (13-17), fair\n(9-< 13) or poor (< 9), based on the protocols used in\nprevious reviews [ 40– 42].\nAn additional risk of bias assessment was conducted\non studies examining proxy reported measurement tools,\nusing the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection\nof health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) risk of\nbias checklist [ 43, 44]. This checklist was devised specif-\nically for assessing the risk of bias of participant reported\nmeasurement property studies. Based on the studies in-\ncluded in our review we conducted the assessment using\nthe sub-sections relating to reliability and construct\n(convergent) validity. It was not possible to assess the\nquality of the content validity of the studies due to such\nminimal information available. Each item was scored\nusing a 4 point scale (very good, adequate, doubtful, in-\nadequate). The overall methodological rating of a study\nwas determined using the COSMIN protocol of ‘the\nworst score counts ’ principle [ 45] (e.g. if the lowest rat-\ning of all items was ‘doubtful’, the overall methodological\nquality of the measurement property in that study would\nbe rated as ‘doubtful’).\nInterpretation of validity, reliability, and feasibility\nStudies commonly use a number of different statistical\nanalyses to define absolute (agreement between the two\nmeasurement tools) or relative (the degree to which the\ntwo measurement tools rank individuals in the same\norder) validity and reliability [ 32, 35]. These types of\nstatistical analyses include correlations (Pearson ’s; Spear-\nman’s; Kendall ’s; Intraclass), linear regressions, root\nmean square error (RMSE), Bland Altman, kappa statis-\ntics and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-\nROC) [ 35, 46– 51]. Additionally, studies use different\nmethods of analysing and reporting the feasibility of\nmeasurement tools. In order to demonstrate consistency\nin the interpretation of the results across studies, and\nalso to compare and rank these results, we scoped the\nrelevant literature to search for guidance.\nWe found no consensus in the literature as to which\nstatistical test results indicate weak, moderate, or good\nvalidity or reliability. However, in line with a number of\nprevious reviews of this type [ 23, 26, 28, 29, 36, 52], we\nprovide an overview of what constitutes a ‘weak’, ‘mod-\nerate’,o r ‘good’ statistical result for validity or reliability,\nto rank individual studies in this way.\nPhillips et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2021) 18:141 Page 5 of 28\nFor proxy reported based measurement tools, feasibil-\nity can only be determined using qualitative methods, in-\ncluding to determine if questions are relevant,\ncomprehensible and understandable [ 34]. However,\nthere is no standardised way of determining feasibility of\nother measurement tools. Therefore, feasibility in the\npresent review was based on qualitative acceptability or\nfeasibility of the measurement tools where data was\navailable. Additionally, an indication of feasibility was\nalso based on compliance and usable data information\nusing values from the Effective Public Health Practice\nProject (EPHPP) quality assessment tool for withdrawal\nand drop out [ 53]. The EPHPP is primarily used for\nassessing the quality of quantitative intervention based\nstudies in systematic reviews and rates studies as\n‘strong’, ‘moderate’,o r ‘weak’ based on the percentage of\nparticipants completing the study. We applied the cri-\nteria to provide an indication on the feasibility of the\nmeasurement tools in our review, to indicate a ‘weak’,\n‘moderate’,o r ‘good’ level of feasibility based on the per-\ncentage of usable data from the measurement tools (as a\nresult of missing data and/or drop out) [ 53]. This was\nused to provide an indication on feasibility only, as the\ntrue feasibility of measurement tools should be deter-\nmined through the use of qualitative research methods\n[36, 54– 56]. When interpreting summary scores for\nfeasibility, more weight was given to qualitative findings;\nthe scores of these studies were based on the qualitative\ndata provided in the original study. Information on the\ninterpretation of the studies can be found in Table 3.\nCombining the results of individual studies for overall\ninterpretation\nWe summarised the results of studies where they aimed\nto compare a particular measurement property\n(separated by level of evidence for validity) of a particu-\nlar measurement tool (e.g. Actigraph GT3X accelerome-\nters). We have included summaries of this information\nin: Table 4 (level 1 validity evidence), Table 5 (level 2\nvalidity evidence), Table 6 (level 3 validity evidence),\nTable 7 (level 4 validity evidence), and Table 8 (reliabil-\nity and feasibility evidence). The evidence outlined in the\ntables was interpreted as follows:\n/C15Where the specific measurement property for a\nspecific measurement tool was deemed ‘good’ in\nover half of these studies, the summary assessment\nwas deemed to be ‘good’.\n/C15Where the specific measurement property for a\nspecific measurement tool was deemed ‘moderate’ in\nover half of these studies, the overall assessment was\ndeemed to be ‘moderate’.\n/C15Where the specific measurement property for a\nspecific measurement tool was deemed ‘weak’ in\nover half of these studies, the overall assessment was\ndeemed to be ‘weak’.\n/C15In instances where the specific measurement\nproperty of a measurement tool had mixed evidence\nin the studies, such as studies with outcomes of\n‘weak’ and ‘moderate’,o r ‘moderate’ and ‘good’, the\noverall assessment was deemed to be the most\npositive of the two outcomes.\nFor completeness, we have included information about\nall tools of reasonable quality in the summary tables\n(Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) where there was any avail-\nable evidence, including where there was only one or\ntwo studies that reported results.

The summary ratings were based on\nthe quality of the tools for the specific measurement property. Where the measurement tool was deemed ‘good’ in the majority of the studies, the summary\nassessment was deemed ‘good’.

Where the measurement tool was deemed ‘weak’ in the majority of the studies, the summary assessment was deemed ‘weak’. In instances where the\nmeasurement tool had mixed evidence in the studies, such as studies with outcomes of ‘weak’ and ‘moderate’,o r ‘moderate’ and ‘good’, the overall assessment\nwas deemed to be the most positive of the two outcomes. All tools of reasonable quality where any evidence was available are included in this table, incl uding\nwhere only one or two studies reported that result\nPhillips et al.

The median age of children included\nin the studies was 4.5 years. The studies commonly ex-\nplored the measurement properties of the measurement\ntools in free-living conditions ( n = 54), used structured\nprotocols that were reflective of habitual behaviour of\npre-school aged children ( n = 11) or were conducted in\nlaboratory settings ( n = 10). A large proportion of the\nstudies did not report on any funding received for the\nresearch ( n = 31). Many of the studies that reported\nfunding were supported by more than one funding\nsource (see Additional file 10 for funding sources of\nstudies).\nStudies assessed the measurement tools for PA only\n(n = 27), SB only ( n = 5), and both PA and SB ( n = 43).\nUnits of measure varied across studies, and included: ac-\ntivity preferences, activity levels, activity counts, activity\nenergy expenditure, energy expenditure, frequency of ac-\ntivity, heart rate, metabolic equivalent of task (MET)\nvalues, posture allocation, step count, time spent in\ndifferent intensities of activity and VO 2.\nThe majority of the studies examined the measure-\nment properties of one measurement tool only ( n =\n65). Several studies examined the measurement prop-\nerties of two ( n = 8) or infrequently three ( n =2 )\nmeasurement tools simultaneously, in comparison\nwith the reference method s. Articles examined the\nmeasurement properties of: calorimetry ( n = 2), direct\nobservation ( n = 4), combined heart rate and accelero-\nmetry ( n = 1), heart rate monitors ( n = 1), accelerom-\neters ( n = 44), pedometers ( n = 13), and proxy report\nmeasures (questionnaires or diaries) reported by par-\nent, carer or teacher ( n = 13).\nValidity of the measurement tools was the most fre-\nquently examined measurement property; level 1 validity\n(n = 12), level 2 validity ( n = 36), level 3 validity ( n = 23)\nand level 4 validity ( n = 9). Only two studies examined\nthe face and content validity of the measurement tools.\nTen studies described the test-retest reliability of the\nmeasurement tools and 1 study the intra-instrument re-\nliability. Feasibility data was abstracted from 41 studies;\n13 of these studies had a primary aim of determining the\nfeasibility of the measurement tool, the remaining 28\nstudies commented on reasons for drop out or exclusion\nof data, which also classified as assessing feasibility.\nTable 9 provides an overview of the measurement\nFig. 1 Flow chart of included studies [ 31]\nPhillips et al.

This table does not state the\nquality of the tools; please refer to Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8\nthat outline summaries of the quality of the tools based\non the available evidence.\nRisk of bias assessment\nRisk of bias was assessed for all included studies using\nthe modified Downs and Black checklist [ 38]. Studies\nconsistently described the main aims of the research, the\nmain outcomes to be measured, the exposures of inter-\nest and the main findings. In most cases, the staff, places\nand facilities were representative of what would usually\nbe the case for the children under study, as testing often\ntook place in nursery settings, at home, or was assessing\nhabitual activity behaviours consisting of children ’s usual\nbehaviours and routines. However, a proportion of the\nstudies were not reflective of usual activity for children\ndue to them being laboratory based or involving struc-\ntured protocols.\nThe main concern regarding potential bias of the studies\nwas related to the lack of reporting of key information in\nthe studies. This included lack of clarity on the representa-\ntiveness of the sample population compared with the\npopulation from which they were recruited ( n =6 3 ) .A l s o ,\nmany studies failed to consistently report reasons for drop\nout (e.g. non-completion, or missing or incomplete data)\n(n = 34). Many of the studies only reported the number of\nchildren included in analysis, but did not include the\nnumber who started the study sample, and so it was un-\nclear as to whether drop out was an issue in these studies.\nThe majority of the studies demonstrated fair to good\nmethodological quality ratings. Only two studies re-\nceived a low methodological quality score [ 136, 137] and\nwere removed from the overall summary analysis, how-\never this did not affect the overall results of the review.\nThe full Downs and Black risk of bias assessment for all\nincluded studies can be found in Additional file 11.\nAn additional risk of bias assessment was conducted\non studies reporting proxy reported measurement tools,\nusing the COSMIN risk of bias [ 43, 44]. The checklist\ndemonstrated that the majority of tools examining con-\nvergent validity were of low quality; five studies were\nrated doubtful [ 100, 122, 125, 127, 128] and seven stud-\nies inadequate [ 68, 98, 120, 121, 123, 124, 126]. In the\nmajority of the studies it was clear what the comparator\ntool measured and the statistical methods used were\ngenerally appropriate. Main concerns with the methodo-\nlogical quality of the studies related to the measurement\nproperties of the comparator tools, with inadequate in-\nformation provided. Proxy reported tools examined for\ntest-retest reliability showed a range of quality, with\nsome studies rated as adequate [ 122, 127, 128], two as\ndoubtful [ 68, 121] and some inadequate [ 123, 124, 135].\nThe full COSMIN risk of bias assessment can be found\nin Additional file 12. This risk of bias assessment\nhighlighted that the studies on proxy reported measure-\nment tools were generally of low quality. However no\nstudies were removed from the overall summary analysis\nTable 9 Overview of all measurement tools examined and measurement properties explored (Continued)\nMeasurement tools examined Validity a Reliability Feasibility\nCriterion:\nLevel 1\nConvergent:\nLevel 2\nConvergent:\nLevel 3\nConvergent:\nLevel 4\nFace/\nContent\nTest-\nretest-\nIntra-\ninstrument\nLeisure time report \nNetherland’s Physical Activity\nQuestionnaire (NPAQ)\n\nNursery teacher ’s report \nPre School Physical Activity\nQuestionnaire (PRE-PAQ)\n \nQuestionnaire developed for\nparents of pre-schoolers in\nMexico\n \nTeacher activity rating \nTeacher/mother reported\nhabitual PA\n\n‘Toybox’ Primary Caregivers\nQuestionnaire\n\nTV Diary \n7 day activity diary (adapted\nfrom CLASS)\n\naValidity separated per level of evidence depending on the quality of measurement tool used (see Table 2 for full explanation)\nPhillips et al.

The quality of the evidence is\nregarded in the interpretation of the studies throughout\nthe review.\nSummary of measurement properties of measurement\ntools, separated by measurement property type\nResults presented here are in line with the level of\nevidence scheme displayed in Table 2. The results will\ntherefore be discussed as follows: Level 1 validity\nevidence where the tool under study is compared with\ncalorimetry; level 2 validity, where the tool under study\nis compared with a measurement tool with relatively\nhigh validity e.g. direct observation; level 3 validity,\nwhere the tool under study is compared with a measure-\nment tool with relatively low validity e.g. device based\nmethod such as accelerometry; level 4 validity, where\ntwo of the same type of measurement tool are compared\nwhere neither tool is considered to have known higher\nvalidity e.g. two makes of accelerometer; reliability;\nfollowed by feasibility. Detailed study tables of all in-\ncluded studies can be found in Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7,\n8 and 9 presented by measurement property examined\nand separated by level of evidence. Where reported,\nthese tables also include details on the interpretation\nchoices used for device based measurement tools, in-\ncluding: cut points, epoch length, placement, wear time,\nnon-wear time and valid number of days. It is critical\nthat when using this review to help with measurement\ntool choice decisions, researchers should replicate the\nprocedures in which the tool was validated (e.g. using\nthe same cut points, epoch length and placement that\nthe tool has shown to be valid for), which can all be\nfound in the Additional files.\nLevel 1 validity\nThe criterion method of calorimetry (including DLW)\nfor the outcome of energy expenditure was used in 12\nstudies. Multiple accelerometers were shown to have\nreasonable ability to determine energy expenditure, but\noften based on very limited evidence (one study only).\nThere was however stronger evidence to suggest that the\nActigraph (in particular the MTI and GT3X) and Actical\nwere both able to determine EE and VO 2 max [ 58– 61],\nand the ActivPAL to determine EE [ 60, 65].\nTable 4 provides a summary table of included studies that\nexamined level 1 validity evidence of measurement tools\n(detailed information can be found in Additional file 4).\nLevel 2 validity\nThe most commonly used comparison methods for con-\nvergent validity of device based measurement tools was\ndirect observation. Studies demonstrated that a number\nof device-based measurement tools were reasonably ac-\ncurate at determining different PA and SB outcomes\n[81– 84, 86, 93, 96]. The Actigraph accelerometer was\nthe most frequently evaluated tool. Overall, these studies\nshowed the Actigraph devices (in particular GT3X ver-\nsions) had a good ability to determine SB, vigorous PA\n(VPA) and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) [ 61, 74–\n77, 79, 80]. Fewer studies evaluated the Actical acceler-\nometer but these showed similar results [ 57, 62]. The\nActivPAL accelerometer was shown to be suitable at\nassessing SB, MVPA and posture allocation [ 65, 87– 89];\na unique quality that is not identified by other measure-\nment tools. However, there is space for this to be devel-\noped further, as the accuracy of this measurement tool\nfor identifying posture allocation is lower than in other\npopulation samples due to the amount of time that pre-\nschool aged children will spend in ‘other’ postures, such\nas kneeling and crawling [ 138]. Fitbits also show some\npromising results for the measurement of SB, MVPA,\ntotal PA (TPA), and step counts [ 90, 91]; however, these\nconclusions are based on a very limited number of\nstudies.\nFor pedometers, when compared against direct obser-\nvation, study results were mixed but there is limited evi-\ndence to suggest that the Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 is\nable to determine step counts with reasonable accuracy\n[95, 96].\nTable 5 provides a summary table of included stud-\nies that examined level 2 validity evidence of meas-\nurement tools (detailed information can be found in\nAdditional file 5).\nLevel 3 validity\nLevel 3 validity evidence mainly consisted of proxy re-\nported measurement tools and they were most frequently\ncompared to accelerometry. Proxy reported measurement\ntools were generally poor at determining PA and SB out-\ncomes. However, the Pre-PAQ was shown to be moder-\nately accurate at determining stationary behaviour, light\nPA and VPA [ 122] and the leisure time report was able to\ndetermine MVPA [ 121]. The Netherland ’s physical activity\nquestionnaire and nursery teacher ’sr e p o r t( b a s e do nT o -\nyama Cohort Study survey questions) could distinguish be-\ntween different levels of activity [ 120, 123]. Although\nrelatively few proxy reported tools demonstrated reason-\nable criterion or convergent validity, this could be due to a\nlack of face and content validity testing during the devel-\nopment of these tools [ 34, 139]. It is also worth noting\nthat this evidence is based on very few, low quality studies.\nAn advantage of the proxy reported tools over the other\nmeasurement tools is that they were able to capture the\ncontext and type of the behaviours, such as screen time,\nrather than just determine movement.\nPhillips et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2021) 18:141 Page 18 of 28\nThe direct observation protocol Observation System\nfor Recording Physical Activity in Children- Preschool\n(OSRAC-P) showed promising agreement with a heart\nrate monitor and pedometer for determining different\nlevels of activity [ 110]. Whilst the System for Observing\nFitness Instruction Time for Preschoolers (SOFIT-P) did\nnot demonstrate strong correlations with the output of\nthe Actigraph (GT3X) [ 111].\nThe Fitbit (Flex) showed excellent ability to determine\nSB and TPA, but not MVPA, when compared with the\nActigraph (GT3X+) [ 112]. For pedometers, activity\ncounts from the Actigraph (CSA/MTI/GT1M) acceler-\nometer were moderately correlated with step counts of\nthe pedometer Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 [ 115, 116]\nand the Omron Walking Style Pro Pedometer (HJ-\n720IT-E2) [ 118] (values ranging from r = 0.64 to 0.92);\nsuggesting that pedometers may be a plausible cheaper\nalternative to accelerometers in some instances [ 82].\nTable 6 provides a summary table of included studies that\nexamined level 3 validity evidence of measurement tools\n(detailed information can be found in Additional file 6).\nLevel 4 validity\nA selection of studies included a comparison between\ntwo different makes of accelerometer each with un-\nknown validity. These studies demonstrated that the com-\nbined heart rate with accelerometer, Actiheart, was shown\nto be similar in the activity count outcome to the acceler-\nometers, Actical and RT3 ( r = 0.80 to 0.95) [ 57]. Similarly,\nthe Actigraph (GT1M) and RT3 showed reasonable simi-\nlarity in activity count outcome [ 80]( r = 0.72). However,\nthe majority of the studies did not show reasonable conver-\ngence, demonstrating that the various types of accelerom-\neter can produce different outcomes [ 76, 78, 83, 129, 130].\nThe increased availability of accelerometers and differences\nin the outcomes of these studies demonstrates the import-\nance of assessing validity of different devices simultan-\neously, alongside comparison measures [ 19]. There was\nweak comparisons between parental and teacher reported\nhabitual physical activity [98, 100].\nTable 7 provides a summary table of included studies that\nexamined level 4 validity evidence of measurement tools\n(detailed information can be found in Additional file 7).\nFace and content validity\nOnly two studies commented on the face and content\nvalidity of the proxy reported measurement tools [ 122,\n124]. Face and content validity was determined by focus\ngroups with parents and pre-school staff and consulting\nexperts during questionnaire development [ 122]; and a\npilot study with 21 parents, to determine the compre-\nhension and reproducibility of the measure [ 124]. The\nPre-PAQ included individual response options for both\nweekend days, due to parents indicating that children ’s\nPA varied more on a weekend than during the week\n[122]. No further information was reported on the level\nof face and content validity within these studies; how-\never, no major comprehension concerns were reported.\nThere was minimal information about the procedures in\nthese included studies and so it was not possible to\nassess the quality or provide firm conclusions on the\ncontent validity.\nTest-retest reliability\nSeveral of the proxy reported tools showed reasonable\ntest-retest reliability (values ranging from r =0 . 7 6t o0 . 9 4 )\n[121, 124, 127, 128] or variable test-retest results, whereby\ngood test-retest for some items on the questionnaire but\npoor for other items [ 121– 123, 135]. There was very lim-\nited evidence showing the test-retest of accelerometry and\npedometry, with good test-retest for some activities but\npoor for others (ICC range from 0.34 to 0.87) [ 117].\nTable 8 provides a summary table of included studies that\nexamined reliability of measurement tools (detailed infor-\nmation can be found in Additional file 8).\nIntra-instrument reliability\nOne accelerometer, the Fitbit (Zip) was the only tool\nto be examined for intra-instrument reliability in the\nincluded studies; showing excellent intra-instrument\nreliability (ICC = 0.91) when two devices were worn\nsimultaneously on the rig ht hip during a 5 minutes\nstructured walking task in the nursery [ 91]. Table 8\nprovides a summary table of included studies that ex-\namined reliability of measurement tools (detailed in-\nformation can be found in Additional file 8).\nFeasibility\nWhole room calorimetry was shown to be accepted\nby pre-school aged children as a way of measuring\nPA and SB [ 131, 132]. However, this method is ex-\npensive, cannot examine free living activity, may only\nbe feasible for smaller scale projects and is highly\nburdensome on researchers d ue to the required train-\ning and expertise; thereby not being viable for surveil-\nlance and the majority of research projects [ 140].\nSimilarly, there were promising results for the feasibil-\nity of direct observation protocols [ 111, 133]. How-\never, due to the intensive and demanding nature of\ndirect observation, there are limits on the practicality\nof this method. Observations usually take place in just\none location and for a short period of time, impacting\nthe viability of this method in large samples and to\nidentify habitual activity [ 140].\nFeasibility and acceptability of device based measure-\nment was generally high [ 73, 78, 115, 130, 134], even\nwhen more than one device was worn simultaneously\nPhillips et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2021) 18:141 Page 19 of 28\n[115, 130]. Although high acceptability of the ActivPAL\naccelerometer was reported [ 130], there was evidence of\nconcerns of irritability of the ActivPAL accelerometer\nbased devices due to these being attached directly to the\nskin [ 78, 88]. This may also be a concern when using\nother devices that attach in a similar way [ 54, 114]. The\nproportions of missing and excluded data, for reasons\nsuch as device malfunction or children not wearing the\ndevice for a sufficient period of time, should be consid-\nered when calculating the sample size for studies.\nThere were no studies that determined the feasibil-\nity of proxy reported measurement tools. Table 8 pro-\nvides a summary table of included studies that\nexamined feasibility of measurement tools (detailed\ninformation can be found in Additional file 9).\nGeneralisability of results\nThe majority of the studies reported the age ( n = 74)\nand sex ( n = 69) of the included children. However, only\nten studies [ 66, 86, 99, 100, 111, 122, 123, 128, 134] re-\nported other key attributes that help determine the gen-\neralisability of the results to the wider population,\nincluding: ethnic origin and socioeconomic profile (SEP).\nTherefore, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that\nresults from the individual studies are generalisable\nacross other populations.\nEthnicity\nEighteen studies described the ethnicity of the sample\nin which the measurement property of the tool was\nexamined. The majority of the studies that reported\non ethnicity had samples with children whom were\nprimarily white or Caucasian [ 57, 60, 66, 77, 85, 93,\n94, 100, 122, 123, 134]. Three of the studies reported\nprimarily Hispanic populations samples [ 99, 111, 128],\nfollowed by primarily African American samples [ 58,\n63]. These was no indication of lower measurement\nproperties of the tools in any specific ethnic group in\nthese studies, however, this was not examined dir-\nectly. Details of these studies are outlined in Add-\nitional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\nSocioeconomic profile\nFourteen studies reported on the socioeconomic profile\n(SEP) of their sample. Some studies reported that at least\nsome of the participants were recruited from pre-schools\ncharacterised to have individuals with lower SEP, such\nas Head Start Centres, which require proof of income to\ndemonstrate that families are at or below poverty level\n[66, 86, 99, 111, 125, 128, 135]. The remaining studies\nthat reported on SEP were based on individual level\ndemographics. These studies reported that the samples\nwere primarily made up of individuals of higher SEP\n[100, 122, 123, 134]. Only one study reported that the\nchildren in their sample were from lower to lower-\nmiddle SEP families [ 126]. Whilst one study also re-\nported an equal amount of participants from both high\nand low SEP families [ 115]. None of the studies directly\nexamined whether SEP affected validity or reliability, or\nwhether there was reduced feasibility of the tools in dif-\nferent SEP groups. There was no evidence to suggest\nthat SEP was affecting the validity or reliability of the\nmeasurement tools being evaluated. The majority of the\nstudies found no indication of reduced feasibility\namongst the different SEP, however, two studies con-\nducted with participants of lower SEP reported a lack of\nfeasibility when using pedometer-based measurement\ntools [ 99, 126]. Details of these studies are outlined in\nAdditional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review identified 69 articles, describing\n75 studies that were examining the measurement prop-\nerties of measurement tools used to assess PA and/or SB\nin pre-school aged children. In this review, we provide\nan overview on what measurement tools have been ex-\namined for what outcome measures, with an indication\non whether these have been shown to be valid, reliable\nor feasible.\nThe heterogeneity of the studies included in this re-\nview emphasises the complexity of measurement of PA\nand SB behaviours, identified previously by others [ 141,\n142], alongside the additional challenges associated with\nmeasurement in a pre-school aged population [ 20, 143].\nWe show that different measurement tools often exam-\nine different dimensions of PA and SB (e.g. time spent\nin different intensities of activity, posture allocation, step\ncount, energy expenditure) in line with previous litera-\nture [ 32, 144]. Measurement tools may all have a specific\nuse depending on their derived purpose, desired meas-\nurement outcomes and the context in which the tool is\nbeing used [ 145]. However, when selecting an appropri-\nate and useful measurement tool to assess PA and SB\namongst children, there is often a trade-off between the\nthree main utilities (validity, reliability, feasibility), along-\nside further considerations, such as the sample size of\nthe study, budget, and availability of resources [ 144]. As\nsuch, it is not a question of which measurement tool is\n‘best’ for assessing the PA and SB of pre-school aged\nchildren, but rather, what measure or combination of\nmeasures, are most appropriate in the given context for\nthe desired outcome measures [ 55, 141, 144, 146, 147].\nIn line with this, the measurement properties of the\ntools are only reflective of the context in which they\nhave been tested and cannot be generalised to other\ncontexts, for example, if a tool showed good validity,\nreliability or feasibility but was examined in a laboratory\nbased setting for use over a short period of time then\nPhillips et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2021) 18:141 Page 20 of 28\nthe tool can only be said to be valid, reliable or feasible\nin this context, and the assessment does not apply to\nfree living longer term measurement. We will, however,\nmake recommendations based on our findings that we\nbelieve would be of interest to those involved in research\nbased on the frequently used PA and SB outcomes.\nOverall, based on the current evidence, which included\na limited number of studies of varying quality, of the\nmeasurement properties of measurement tools used to\nexamine PA and SB of pre-school aged children, mul-\ntiple accelerometers, including the Actigraph (in particu-\nlar GT3X versions), Actical, ActivPAL and Fitbits (Flex\nand Zip), can provide valid measures, with some evi-\ndence of feasibility, of movement-related behaviours that\nwould be of interest in a range of research where re-\nsources and capacity allow. However, disadvantages\ninclude the need for expertise in the analysis of data,\ndevice malfunctions and continuous technological ad-\nvances and development of new and improved activity\nmonitoring devices, which increases difficultly for stand-\nardisation within and between studies [ 148, 149].\nAlongside this, there are also differences on subjective\ndecisions when using accelerometry, including: epochs,\ncut points, placement, wear time, non-wear time and\nvalid number of days, which determines whether the\ndata is valid or not [ 19, 20, 138, 150, 151]. Proxy report\nbased measurement tools, in particular the PRE-PAQ\nand leisure time report, also show some promise, for\nsome dimensions of PA and SB. Although, the evidence\nquality is weak, therefore, much more evaluation of the\nmeasurement properties of these types of tools is\nneeded. These measurement tools have advantage in\nterms of identifying contextual behaviour, cost, accessi-\nbility and can be consistently used in a standardised way,\nas they are not reliant on upgrades in technology [ 152].\nAdditionally, whole room calorimetry and direct obser-\nvation were shown to be accepted and feasible methods\nfor measuring PA and SB of pre-school aged children.\nHowever, this was based on a very small number of\nstudies and small sample sizes. As these methods are ex-\npensive, highly burdensome and intensive, require exten-\nsive training, and can only capture a short period of\ntime, they may only be feasible for smaller scale projects\nand for only some dimensions of PA and SB.\nFace and content validity have been suggested to be a\ncrucial first step in determining the appropriateness of a\nmeasure, to determine if the measurement tool is asses-\nsing what it intends to measure and to identify whether\nthe measure is understandable to the target population\n[34, 153, 154]. However, only two of the included studies\nreported on an element of face and content validity of\ntheir measures [ 122, 124].\nA limited number of monitors were examined for reli-\nability; the Fitbit Zip showed excellent intra-instrument\nreliability, however, this was based on one study only\n[91]. More research studies examining the intra-\ninstrument reliability of measurement tools in pre-\nschool aged children are warranted. Similarly, very few\nstudies explicitly examined the feasibility, including\nacceptability, of the measurement tools [ 73, 78, 88, 99,\n111, 114, 115, 128, 130– 134], although, a proportion of\nthe studies did report exclusion of participants and miss-\ning data. The measurement properties of measurement\ntools may be comprised if they are not feasible in the\ncontext and with the population in which they are to be\nused. The ability to identify reasons for missing data,\nreasons for non-compliance and overall acceptability\nand feasibility of the measurement tools, to determine\nend user experience, will help with understanding which\ntools are most applicable for use [ 36].\nThe review revealed a discrepancy in the amount of stud-\nies examining each measurem ent tool; with an emphasis\nplaced on examining the measurement properties of device\nbased measurement tools, primarily accelerometers, making\nup 70% of all studies, with multiple studies examining the\nsame type of accelerometer. Accelerometers were also fre-\nquently used as a comparison measurement tool. A major\nlimitation of the included studi es utilising accelerometers\nwas the considerable variation i n the interpretation of data,\ndue to differences in the subjective decisions on epochs, cut\npoints, placement, wear time, non-wear time and valid\nnumber of days [ 19, 20, 138, 150, 151]. At least sixteen\ndifferent published cut points were used in the included\nstudies [57, 58, 63, 69– 71, 84, 85, 101, 103– 109], with some\nstudies applying their own. Su ch methodological inconsist-\nencies can be problematic, as applying different cut points\nto the same data can result in statistically and biologically\nsignificant differences in the outcomes of PA [ 102, 155,\n156]. Although we provide reference to the published cut\npoints used for each study in the summary tables, ultim-\nately, the overall aims of the studies included in this review\nwere not to show which data interpretation choices were\nmost valid, and so we cannot d etermine which data inter-\npretation choices are best to use. Therefore, it is important\nto note that the devices shown to be valid can only be said\nto be valid with the data inte rpretation choices in which\nthey were tested. If researchers decide that a device based\nmeasurement tool is best for their research study, it is im-\np o r t a n tt oe n s u r eu s eo ft h er e spective epochs, cut points\nand monitor placement outlined in the validation studies.\nWe provide information on the i nterpretation choices used\nin each study in the tables outlined in Additional files 4, 5,\n6 and 7.\nAdditionally, tools in the included studies were often\nevaluated over a short space of time, usually around 1 h,\ndue to use of an intensive reference method (such as\nwhole room calorimetry or direct observation). Conse-\nquently, wear time, non-wear time and information on\nPhillips et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2021) 18:141 Page 21 of 28\nthe amount of valid number of days required for longer\nterm data collection were not required. However, for\nexamining PA, a full 7 days of measurement is preferred\nwhere possible [ 157, 158], with a minimum of 3 days re-\nquired for reasonable estimates [ 159– 161]. For examin-\ning SB, research suggests that ≥4 days of monitoring is\nrequired for reasonable estimates [ 162]. In addition to\nthis, it is suggested that data include at least one week-\nend day [ 163]. Similarly, there are differences in the rec-\nommended number of hours wear time of the device,\nranging from 6 to 10 hour wear time per day required\nfor the most reliable estimates of PA [ 158– 160, 164].\nCollecting data using a 7 day wear protocol is recom-\nmended to increase the chances of there being enough\ndata. Studies should ensure that they include the mini-\nmum amount of data, including both number of days\nand hours per day, to meet a reliability score of at least\n0.7, and should report this in their study [ 163, 165].\nSimilarly, there is no consensus on defining non-wear\ntime of accelerometry data [ 20, 138]. Non-wear time is\noften determined by consecutive zero counts in the data\nsets, however, this varies between studies and becomes\nmore challenging when also examining SB using accel-\nerometry [ 138]. A common and useful way in which\nnon-wear time can be determined is by completion of a\nlog to state when the accelerometer was removed and\nreasons for this; which can then be cross-validated with\nnumbers of consecutive zeros within the data sets [ 20,\n166].\nThe majority of studies included in this review were\nconducted in a free living (habitual) context, including at\nthe pre-school and/or at home [ 32]. However, the results\nof the studies were often lacking in potential for generalis-\nability and translation. As is the case for much research,\nidentified studies have traditionally been conducted in\nhigh income countries. There was no evidence to suggest\ndifferences in the measurement properties of the measure-\nment tools across different ethnicities or SEP, however a\nvery small proportion of the studies explored these factors,\nand none directly. Similarly, there was minimal evidence\nof the measurement properties of the tools being evalu-\nated with large sample sizes, so the capability of the tools\nat scale are unknown.\nA major limitation in the field of PA and SB measure-\nment is the lack of criterion methods for the majority\noutcomes, and indeed a lack of consensus on what might\nbe considered a criterion. We used the level of evidence\nscheme to distinguish between differing levels of validity\nof the comparison measurement tools, but caution\nshould always be applied when validity is measured\nagainst non-criterion methods, especially when the valid-\nity of these methods themselves are not well established.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the review\nA primary strength of this review is that we assessed\ninternational literature for evidence on this topic, which\nincluded extensive searching of multiple platforms; pub-\nlished academic research articles through database\nsearching, searches of the grey literature, and manual\nsearches. Another strength of this review is that we ex-\namined various measurement properties of measurement\ntools; including the feasibility of the measures.\nA potential weakness of this review was the risk of bias\nassessment, due to the tool that was used. Although we\nbelieve that we used the best available tool, it was not\nideal because it was not devised specifically for studies\nexamining the measurement properties of measurement\ntools. However, we did use an additional risk of bias\nassessment on proxy reported measurement tools due to\nthis being available for these types of studies. Addition-\nally, although two reviewers screened a 10% sample of\nthe title and abstracts with very high agreement, only\none reviewer screened the remaining studies and so it is\nplausible that studies were missed through human error.\nA limitation of the research is that we did not explore\nthe measurement property of ‘responsiveness’ in our\nsearch terms. Responsiveness, defined as ‘The ability of a\nPROM to detect change over time in the construct to be\nmeasured‘ [145], is a measurement property that is not\nwell established in the field of PA and SB measurement.\nThis is apparent from the literature [ 28, 29]a n dw h e nc o n -\nducting initial scoping searches for this review, no studies\nexploring responsiveness were identified. No studies were\nidentified, also, through our additional hand searches. We\nare, therefore, currently unable to determine whether any\nproxy reported tools are able to detect changes in behav-\niour over time (e.g. in response to an intervention) and it\nis essential that this is the focus of future research.\nImplications for research\nThe lack of multiple studies examining the same meas-\nurement tool makes it difficult to produce firm conclu-\nsions on the measurement properties of some tools [ 28].\nDifferences in the number of studies examining each\nmeasurement tool, the ways in which the studies were\nconducted, the differences in comparison measurement\ntools used, the included samples, and reported outcome\nmeasures can make direct comparisons between the\nresults of the studies difficult.\nFuture research should focus on the measurement\nproperties of measurement tools being examined in dif-\nferent populations to ensure external validity of the mea-\nsures and to extend the generalisability of the findings\nfrom these types of studies. This should include using\nlarge sample sizes, individuals with varying SEP and with\ndifferent ethnicities, and conducted in lower income\ncountries; this would help to evaluate the measurement\nPhillips et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity          (2021) 18:141 Page 22 of 28\nproperties, including feasibility and acceptability, of the\nmeasures in different contexts [ 16]. However, only after\na measurement tool is shown to be valid, reliable, and\nfeasible in the population for which it was originally\ndeveloped [ 145].\nIn addition to this, research projects examining the PA\nor SB of pre-school aged children should look to identify\nthe context in which the measurement properties of\ntools have been examined prior to choosing which tool\nmay be most appropriate for their purpose. If the meas-\nurement properties of the selected tool are unknown in\nthe context in which they are to be used, researchers\nshould aim to conduct a validation check even if just on\na sub-sample of children included in the study. This\nwould be useful to identify whether the measurement\ntools are working as intended and to ensure greater\nconfidence in the results of the study.\nOur review highlights the importance of reporting on\ninternal validity, such as missing data and non-\ncompletion within studies. Studies that reported such\ndata revealed various important implications of using\nmeasurement tools, including that malfunctions of\nmeasurement tools, primarily with device based meas-\nurement tools and calorimetry, can have sufficient im-\npact on the included final sample [ 76, 118, 122]. We\nhighlight the need to examine and report missing data,\nas these considerations can substantially impact on the\nutility of a tool [ 56].\nFurther qualitative work in this area is needed, with\ntwo main purposes: 1) to determine the feasibility and\nacceptability of measurement tools and 2) to examine\nface and content validity. In some instances in this re-\nview, an indication of feasibility of the tools was pro-\nvided based on numerical scores due to this being the\nonly available feasibility data within the studies. How-\never, we wish to highlight that the true feasibility of a\nmeasure cannot be expressed in numbers only, and\nmuch more qualitative work is needed in this area. This\nhas been recognised in previous research, highlighting\nthe importance of conducting qualitative research to\nexamine the feasibility of measurement tools in the tar-\nget population prior to use [ 54, 55, 139]; with such work\nbeing important to understand recruitment bias and rea-\nsons for missing data or non-completion [ 36, 56]. Add-\nitionally, qualitative work to determine validity is rarely\nconducted, demonstrated by only two studies included\nin the current review that commented on these aspects\n[122, 124]. However, face and content validity conducted\nusing qualitative methods have been highlighted as a\ncrucial first step in examining the validity of measure-\nment tools for PA and SB, to determine whether tools\nare valid for their intended purpose [ 28, 32].\nFuture research should focus on further development\nand evaluation of proxy report methods together with\nthe target population and ensure representativeness and\nfeasibility of the measurement tool in the context in\nwhich it is intended to be used.\nConclusions\nThe measurement tools used to measure PA and SB in\npre-school aged children show mixed measurement\nproperties, and were generally based on minimal studies\nproviding variable quality of evidence. There is a clear\nneed for further and more in-depth evaluation work.\nBased on currently available evidence, we conclude that\nthe Actigraph (in particular GT3X versions), Actical and\nActivPAL, have the greatest measurement properties for\nassessing common movement related outcomes (e.g. SB,\nMVPA, TPA) for free living activity of pre-school aged\nchildren, and should be the tool of choice where re-\nsources allow and where logistically possible. The Fitbit\n(Flex and Zip) also shows very promising results; how-\never, these were based on a very limited sample of stud-\nies. Where measurement of a large sample is required\nand where budgets are limited, proxy measures can\nprovide some valid data, alongside useful contextual\ninformation not captured by device-based measurement\ntools. A combination of accelerometers and proxy\nreported measurement tools (based on parent or carer\nreports) may be most useful for a range of PA and SB\noutcome measures.\nAbbreviations\nAUC-ROC: Area under the receiver operating curve; COSMIN: COnsensus-\nbased Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments;\nDLW: Doubly labelled water; EPHPP: Effective Public Health Practice Project;\nLPA: Light physical activity; MVPA: Moderate to vigorous physical activity;\nPA: Physical activity; PRE-PAQ: Pre School Physical Activity Questionnaire; PRIS\nMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses;\nPROSPERO: Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews; SB: Sedentary\nbehaviour; SEP: Socioeconomic profile; TPA: Total physical activity; UK: United\nKingdom; USA: United States of America\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12966-021-01132-9.\nAdditional file 1.
