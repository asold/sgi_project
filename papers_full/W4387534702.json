    "abstract": "The acquisition of high-resolution (HR) digital bathymetric models (DBMs) is crucial for oceanic research activities. However, obtaining HR DBM data is challenging, which has led to the use of super-resolution (SR) methods to improve the DBM’s resolution, as, unfortunately, existing interpolation methods for DBMs suffer from low precision, which limits their practicality. To address this issue, we propose a seabed terrain feature extraction transform model that combines the seabed terrain feature extraction module with the efficient transform module, focusing on the terrain characteristics of DBMs. By taking advantage of these two modules, we improved the efficient extraction of seabed terrain features both locally and globally, and as a result, we obtained a highly accurate SR reconstruction of DBM data within the study area, including the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean and the adjacent sea. A comparative analysis with bicubic interpolation, SRCNN, SRGAN, and SRResNet shows that the proposed method decreases the root mean square error (RMSE) by 16%, 10%, 13%, and 12%, respectively. These experimental results confirm the high accuracy of the proposed method in terms of reconstructing HR DBMs.",
