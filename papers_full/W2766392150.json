  "abstract": "Modern Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems collect any available data from the systems they monitor and control. Some of the data available in modern SCADA systems include types of the data that can be used for centralized monitoring of transformers. Paper presents possible advanced analysis and reports for monitored transformer units using available SCADA data to be used for monitoring of the life of the transformer and help to schedule regular, predictive and corrective types of maintenance. Paper shows which type of data is available, and what percentage of transformers has the kind of data used for monitoring. Examples of measurement data collected are shown for representative transformers. There is an overview on tap changer position moves and its impact on transformer lifetime and servicing interval. For transformers with available temperature of winding an annualized relative ageing rate is calculated.",
