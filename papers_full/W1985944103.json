    "abstract": "We have developed two new gas switches that are designed to be used with linear transformer drivers. The switches, which can be DC charged to 200 kV and triggered with less than a 2-ns 1-σ jitter, have overall inductances ranging from 69 to 85 nH. When transferring 400 J of energy per shot, the switches have lifetimes in excess of 5000 shots. The two switches are insulated with 130–270 PSIA of air and are submerged in transformer oil during operation. These switches should allow development of linear transformer drivers that are more compact and have higher peak power.",
