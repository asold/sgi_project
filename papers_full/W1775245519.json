INTRODUCTION  \nIn recent years, there has been an increased concer n about \nthe effects of nonlinear loads on electric power sy stems [1]. \nHarmonic currents adversely affect virtually every component \nin the power system, creating additional dielectric , thermal, \nand/or mechanical stresses [2]. The harmonic currents flowing \nthrough the power system impedances result in harmo nic \nvoltage drops which are observed as voltage distortions. Severe \nvoltage distortions may occur when the power system 's \ninductive and capacitive reactance’s happen to be e qual \n(parallel resonance) at one of the nonlinear load's  significant \nharmonic current frequencies (typically the 5th, 7t h, 11th or \n13th harmonic) [2B5]. \nEven without resonance, harmonic currents cause los ses in \nnormal power system components. Wiring experiences \nadditional heating beyond the normal I \n2R, due to skin and \nproximity effects. Harmonics also cause over heatin g of the \nneutral conductor due to the additive nature of triple harmonics \n(3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) on three phase four wire sys tems serving \nnonlinear loads with lineBtoBneutral connections [6, 7]. \nWith transformers, harmonic load currents cause additional \nheating, primarily in the form of additional windin g eddy \ncurrent losses. IEEE C57.110, provides methods to d eBrate a \ntransformer for any given harmonic load profile [8]. \nKBfactor transformers are specifically designed to \naccommodate harmonic currents and they have an addi tional \nthermal capacity of known limits, allowing operatio n up to \nnameplate capacity without deBrating. \nII. KBFACTOR TRANSFORMERS  \nKBfactor rating is optionally applied to a transfor mer, \nindicating its suitability for use with loads that draw non \nsinusoidal currents. The KBfactor is given by the f ollowing \nequation [6, 9].  \nmax \n2 2 \n1\n( ) \nh\nh\nh\nK Factor I h pu \n=\n=\n− = ∑  (1) \nwhere: \nh= harmonic number, I\nh = the fraction of total rms load current \nat harmonic number h \nKBfactor rated transformers have not been evaluated for use \nwith harmonic loads where the rms current of any si ngular \nharmonic greater than the tenth harmonic is greater than 1/h of \nthe fundamental rms current. \nA.  Relationship between K-factor and harmonic loss factor \nThe definition of the KBfactor by the Underwriter’s  \nLaboratory (UL) [10] is based on using the transfor mer rated \ncurrent in the calculation of per unit current in t he previous \nequation. Substituting the rated current for the KBfactor gives:  \nmax max \n2 2 2 2 \n2\n1 1 \n1( ) \nh h \nh\nh\nh h R R \nIK Factor h I h I I \n= = \n= = \n− = = ∑ ∑   (2) \nwhere:  \nh   is the harmonic order, I\nh   is the rms current at harmonic “h” \n(amperes), IR   is the rms fundamental current under rated \nfrequency and rated load conditions (amperes). \nThe relationship of the harmonic loss factor and th e UL KB\nfactor [11B13] is given by:  \nmax \n2\n1\n2( ) \nh\nh\nh\nHL \nR\nI\nK Factor F I\n=\n=− = \n∑\n                     (3)                                      \nThe harmonic loss factor is a function of the harmo nic \ncurrent distribution and is independent of the rela tive \nmagnitude. The UL KBfactor is dependent on both the  \nmagnitude and the distribution of the harmonic curr ent. For a \nETASR - Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research  Vol. 1, /glyph817o. 5, 2011, 114-120  115  \n  \nwww.etasr.com Gouda et al: A Study of K-factor Powe r Transformer Characteristics by Modeling Simulation  \n \nset of harmonic load current measurements, the calc ulation of \nthe UL KBfactor is dependent on the transformer rat ed \nsecondary current. For a new transformer with harmo nic \ncurrents specified as per unit of the rated transformer secondary \ncurrent, the KBfactor and harmonic loss factor have  the same \nnumerical values. The numerical value of the KBfact or equals \nthe numerical value of the harmonic loss factor onl y when the \nsquare root of the sum of the harmonic currents squared equals \nthe rated secondary current of the transformer [14, 15]. \nB.  Standard transformers K-factor ratings \nThe standard KBfactor transformer ratings and typical loads \nare given in Table I [10]. \nTABLE I.

For example, a KB13 transformer can be \nfully loaded with any harmonic load having a KBfactor up to KB\n13. If the load has a KBfactor greater than 13, the n the \ntransformer cannot be safely operated at full load and would \nrequire deBrating [16]. \nFor KBfactor transformers, UL also requires that the neutral \nterminal and connections be sized to accommodate tw ice the \nrated phase conductor size (double the minimum neut ral \ncapacity) of standard transformers. Standard transf ormers, i.e. \nthose not marked with a KBfactor rating, may have s ome \ntolerance to nonlinear loading [16], but their capa bility is \nunknown to the user and is not certified by a third party such as \nUL. Currently, marking a transformer with a KBfactor rating is \nnot required by UL. \nIII. C\nASE STUDY  \nThe Toshka Pumping Station was constructed between \n1998 and 2003. It is literally the largest state pr oject in Egypt. \nLocated along the shores of the Nasser Lake, which was \ncreated by the construction of the famous, Aswan Da m, this \npumping station is a project in which Hitachi, Ltd. installed 21 \nlarge vertical centrifugal volute pumps with the ca pacity to \ndraw 29 million cubic meters of water per day and s upply it to \nthe desert area. About 2,250 square kilometers of land are to be \ngreened through this project [17, 18]. A view of th e Toshka \npumping station is illustrated in Figure 1. \n \nFig. 1.  Toshka Pumping Station \nA.  Description of Toshka pumping station \nThe pumping station, which is located at the intake  basin, \nwill accommodate (in the final stage) 24 variable speed pumps \nwith a total capacity of 288MW (24 x 12MW) and a to tal \ndischarge of 400 m 3/s (24 x 16.7m 3/s). The static suction head \nis 56m. The pumping station dimensions are 145 x 60 x 45m (l \nx h x w). The electrical supply to the plant is sec ured via a \n220/11KV substation in Toshka and an 11 kV bus duct , which \nwere also supplied by ABB in a separate contract un der the \nToshka Project. Figure 2 represents the single line  diagram of \n220kV substation to 11kV Toshka pump station. \n \nFig. 2.  Connection between Aswan connection substation and Toshka \npumping station \nB.

Measurements of the \nharmonic currents and KBfactor calculations for Tos hka \npumping station without harmonic filter are shown i n Table II \nand with harmonic filter are shown in Table III. Th e \nmeasurements are carried out on phase B. From the \nmeasurement values it is shown that the KBfactor for the system \nwithout harmonic filter is equal to 5.436679, where as the KB\nfactor for the system with harmonic filter is equal to 1.200575, \nwhich means that he use of the harmonic filter decr eases the \nselected KBfactor transformer ratings almost five times. \n \n \n \nTABLE II.  \nHARMONICS MEASUREMENT WITHOUT FILTER  \nH I H% fund I H I h = I H / I rms  H 2*(I  h )2 \n1 100 1 0.996924891 0.993859237 \n3 2.5591 0.025591 0.025512305 0.005857899 \n5 6.8061 0.068061 0.067851705 0.115096347 \n7 2.263 0.02263 0.02256041 0.024939633 \n9 0.12456 0.0012456 0.00124177 0.000124901 \n11 1.4063 0.014063 0.014019755 0.023782976 \n13 1.3018 0.013018 0.012977968 0.028464274 \n15 0.05778 \n9 \n0.0005778 \n9 \n0.000576113 7.46789E-05 \n17 0.09951 \n4 \n0.0009951 \n4 \n0.00099208 0.00028444 \n19 \n \n0.08968 \n6 \n0.0008968 \n6 \n0.000894102 0.00028859 \n21 0.05123 \n3 \n0.0005123 \n3 \n0.000510755 0.000115044 \n23 0.20088 0.0020088 0.002002623 0.002121553 \n25 0.07366 \n9 \n0.0007366 \n9 \n0.000734425 0.000337112 \n27 0.05600 \n2 \n0.0005600 \n2 \n0.000558298 0.000227227 \n29 0.04900 \n7 \n0.0004900 \n7 \n0.000488563 0.000200741 \n31 0.09088 \n2 \n0.0009088 \n2 \n0.000906025 0.000788867 \n33 0.04416 \n6 \n0.0004416 \n6 \n0.000440302 0.00021112 \n35 0.05046 \n9 \n0.0005046 \n9 \n0.000503138 0.000310106 \n37 0.05041 \n1 \n0.0005041 \n1 \n0.00050256 0.000345763 \n39 0.04367 \n2 \n0.0004367 \n2 \n0.000435377 0.00028831 \n41 0.03704 \n6 \n0.0003704 \n6 \n0.000369321 0.000229285 \n43 0.04254 \n5 \n0.0004254 \n5 \n0.000424142 0.000332628 \n45 0.04760 \n5 \n0.0004760 \n5 \n0.000474586 0.000456095 \n47 0.07259 \n6 \n0.0007259 \n6 \n0.000723728 0.001157034 \n49 0.05342 \n9 \n0.000534 0.000532647 0.000681194 \n∑    = 1.200575 \n \n \n \nFig. 3.

The total harmonic distortion  for current \nand voltage with and without the use of the harmoni c filter is \nlisted in Table V. The calculated KBfactor for the simulated \nmodel with and without harmonic filter is shown in Table V. \nThe KBfactor without the use of the harmonic filter  is 5.1497 \nwhich is five times greater than the KBfactor calcu lated when \nusing the harmonic filter. Therefore, when a harmon ic filter is \nemployed, the KBfactor rating used is K1 or K4 wher eas a KB\nfactor rating of K7 is used when a harmonic filter is not \nemployed. The KBfactor calculated from the measured  values \ntaken from the station is approximately equal to th e calculated \nvalues of the simulated model. \n \n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 -2 \n-1.5 \n-1 \n-0.5 \n0\n0.5 \n1\n1.5 \n2 x 10 \n4\nTime (s) \nPhases Voltage (V) \n \nFig. 12.  3BPhase voltage at low tension side of 25MVA 66/11KV \ntransformer with harmonic filter \n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 \n-3 \n-2 \n-1 \n0\n1\n2\n3\nx 10 \nTime (s) \n3 - P h a se  C u r r e n t (k A ) \n \nFig. 13.  3BPhase Current at low tension side of 25MVA 66/11KV \ntransformer with harmonic filter \n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 \n-1 \n-0.5 \n0\n0.5 \n1\nx 10 \n4Selected signal: 10 cycles.

CONCLUSION  \nIn this paper a study of KBfactor power transformer  \ncharacteristics is presented. A case study (Toshka pumping \nstation) is simulated with the use of Matlab Simulink. The total \nharmonics distortion at the output of 25MVA, 66/11K V \ntransformer with and without harmonic filter is cal culated. \nMeasured harmonics current and calculated KBfactors with and \nwithout filters are in agreement with the results obtained by the \nsuggested model.  \nREFERENCES  \n[1]  I.
