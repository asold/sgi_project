Campbell and Gary Abel \nAbstract \nBackground Electronic clinical decision support tools (eCDS) are increasingly available to assist General Practitioners \n(GP) with the diagnosis and management of a range of health conditions. It is unclear whether the use of eCDS tools \nhas an impact on GP workload. This scoping review aimed to identify the available evidence on the use of eCDS tools \nby health professionals in general practice in relation to their impact on workload and workflow.\nMethods A scoping review was carried out using the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework. The search \nstrategy was developed iteratively, with three main aspects: general practice/primary care contexts, risk assessment/\ndecision support tools, and workload-related factors. Three databases were searched in 2019, and updated in 2021, \ncovering articles published since 2009: Medline (Ovid), HMIC (Ovid) and Web of Science (TR). Double screening was \ncompleted by two reviewers, and data extracted from included articles were analysed.\nResults The search resulted in 5,594 references, leading to 95 full articles, referring to 87 studies, after screening. \nOf these, 36 studies were based in the USA, 21 in the UK and 11 in Australia. A further 18 originated from Canada or \nEurope, with the remaining studies conducted in New Zealand, South Africa and Malaysia. Studies examined the use \nof eCDS tools and reported some findings related to their impact on workload, including on consultation duration. \nMost studies were qualitative and exploratory in nature, reporting health professionals’ subjective perceptions of \nconsultation duration as opposed to objectively-measured time spent using tools or consultation durations. Other \nworkload-related findings included impacts on cognitive workload, “workflow” and dialogue with patients, and clini-\ncians’ experience of “alert fatigue” .\nConclusions The published literature on the impact of eCDS tools in general practice showed that limited efforts \nhave focused on investigating the impact of such tools on workload and workflow. To gain an understanding of this \narea, further research, including quantitative measurement of consultation durations, would be useful to inform the \nfuture design and implementation of eCDS tools.\n*Correspondence:\nEmily Fletcher\ne.fletcher@exeter.ac.uk\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 41Fletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \nKeywords General practice, Workload, Electronic clinical decision support, Consultations, Diagnosis, Risk\nIntroduction\nUK General Practitioners (GPs) manage a high and ris -\ning workload of increasingly complex patient care with \nmany competing demands to attend to within time-lim -\nited consultations [1 ]. This, and ongoing recruitment \nand retention challenges, has led to a GP workforce \n‘crisis’ [2 –5]. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced \nfurther pressures on general practice, with associated \nback-logs of consultations, diagnoses, and referrals [6 –\n9]; GP workload therefore continues to be an increas -\ningly pressing issue for health professionals, patients \nand policy makers.\nClinical decision support (CDS) tools are used by \nhealth professionals to assist with clinical decision \nmaking in relation to screening, diagnosis and man -\nagement of a range of health conditions [10– 14]. Many \nCDS tools exist for use in primary care and more \nrecently are being embedded in electronic form (eCDS) \nwithin practice IT systems, drawing directly on data \nwithin patients’ electronic medical records (EMR) for \ntheir operation [11, 15, 16]. Many Clinical Commis -\nsioning Groups and Primary Care Networks have sup -\nported the introduction of eCDS tools that facilitate \ndiagnosis and expedite referral for certain conditions, \nsuch as cancer, particularly since the COVID-19 pan -\ndemic [17]. For the purpose of this article, an eCDS \ntool is defined as any electronic or computerised tool \nwhich provides an output pertaining to a possible diag -\nnosis and/or management of a health condition, using \npatient-specific information.\nThe workload implications of GPs using eCDS tools \nduring consultations are unclear. One way of examin -\ning GP workload is to evaluate the duration of consul -\ntations [18], although that is only a single element of \nGP work, not including time taken for managing refer -\nrals, investigations, results, and general administra -\ntion, undertaking training, and supervising colleagues \n[19, 20]. The duration of consultations and the ‘flow’ \nof patients through consulting sessions, however, pro -\nvide key ways of measuring workload as these have an \nimpact upon GPs’ levels of stress throughout the work -\ning day [21– 23]. Understanding whether using eCDS \ntools impacts consultation duration and patient ‘flow’ \nthrough consulting sessions may help facilitate the \nimplementation of eCDS tools into practice.\nHere we aimed to establish if there is pre-existing \nevidence on potential workload, including impact on \nconsultation durations, associated with the use of eCDS \ntools by health professionals in general practice and \nprimary care. The objective of this literature review \ntherefore was to identify the available evidence on using \neCDS tools and analyse their impact on workload.\nMethods\nA systematic scoping review was undertaken to iden -\ntify literature using the stages set out in the Arksey and \nO’Malley methodological framework, enhanced by more \nrecent recommendations [24, 25]. This method enables \nexamination of the extent, range and nature of research \nactivity with an aim of identifying all existing relevant \nliterature.\nA broad research question was used: What is known \nfrom the existing literature about the use of eCDS tools \nby health professionals in general practice/primary care \nand the associated impact on workload and patient ‘flow’ \nthrough consulting sessions?\nAn initial scoping search was conducted using the \ndatabases: MEDLINE (Ovid), HMIC (Ovid) and Web of \nScience (TR). Keywords from titles and abstracts iden -\ntified by this search, and index terms used to describe \nthese articles, were identified (see Fig.  1). A second \nsearch across the same databases was then undertaken \nusing the identified keywords and index terms, and stud -\nies collated for abstract and title screening to identify rel -\nevant full-text articles to be reviewed. The searches were \nconducted in September 2019 and updated in August \n2021. The review extensively targeted articles in written \nEnglish, and published in a ten-year period prior to the \ninitial search date. This time period was selected in order \nto identify research on eCDS in the context of today’s \ngeneral practice and primary care, and to manage review \nin context of available resources. A comprehensive search \nstrategy and set of search terms used is provided in Fig. 1.\nThe review aimed to identify research studies, reports \nand articles, including literature reviews, investigating the \nuse of eCDS tools by all health professionals in relation to \ntheir impact on workload, such as consultation duration. \nThe focus on ‘health professionals’ in primary care, not \njust on GPs, was intentional – we sought to identify all \nrelevant contextual research. Therefore, studies concern -\ning any type of health condition, eCDS tool, healthcare \ncontext within primary care or health professional were \neligible. Both quantitative and qualitative evidence were \nincluded. Systematic reviews were included as studies in \ntheir own right, and thereafter the references of studies \nincluded in those reviews were screened for eligibility \nand relevance. Eligible and relevant references within a \nsystematic review were then included in addition to those \nPage 3 of 41\nFletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \n \nprimary studies identified by the original searches. Stud -\nies relating specifically to the design or development of \neCDS tools, and those focussing on clinical factors asso -\nciated with specific conditions, were excluded. Protocol \narticles were excluded if the published results article of \nthe same study were available.\nStudy selection was guided by: (i) an initial team \nmeeting to discuss inclusion and exclusion criteria, (ii) \nall abstracts and full text articles were independently \nreviewed by two reviewers, and (iii) team meetings were \nheld throughout the process to discuss and resolve con -\nflicts of agreement. The following key information was \ngathered from the included studies: author(s), year of \npublication, study origin, study aims, type of eCDS tool \nin study, study population/context, methods, and out -\ncome measures. EF, a health services researcher, classified \nthe key findings into categories, defined as consultation \nduration-related (‘perceived’ or ‘objectively-measured’), \nFig. 1 Search terms\nPage 4 of 41Fletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \nor ‘other’ workload-related. The articles were organ -\nised using Covidence review software, then collated in a \ndescriptive format using Microsoft Excel, and reviewed \nto summarise the key findings.\nResults\nThe database search yielded 5694 publications (4007 \nafter removal of duplicates, Fig.  2). After screening \ntitles and abstracts, 211 publications were selected for \nfull-text screening. Of these, 120 were excluded for \nnot meeting the inclusion criteria, resulting in 91 pub -\nlications being included in the scoping review. Four of \nthese articles were systematic reviews; screening of eli -\ngibility and relevance of references included in those \nreviews led to the inclusion of a further four articles. \nThe total 95 included articles referred to 87 research \nstudies.\nFig. 2 Summary of the screening process\nPage 5 of 41\nFletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \n \nDescription of included articles\nAll studies were conducted in high-income countries, \nwith the exception of one from Sub-Saharan Africa. A \nthird of the articles from the studies originated in the \nUSA (36), with UK and Australian articles compris -\ning another third (21 and 11 respectively). A further 18 \npublications originated in Canada and mainland Europe, \nwith the remaining studies conducted in New Zealand \n(2), South Africa (2) and Malaysia (1). For most articles \nworkload was not the main focus, with only 16 examining \nit either as a main focus or as one of the aims.\nThe most common clinical areas of focus among the \neCDS tools studied were cancer risk assessment (15 arti -\ncles), cardiovascular disease (11), and prescribing for \nvarious conditions (10). Other common clinical areas \nincluded: blood-borne viruses (3 articles), and various \nother long-term conditions (14 articles, including those \non diabetes, chronic kidney disease, asthma, Chronic \nObstructive Pulmonary Disease, and hypertension). \nSmaller numbers focussed on tools for other conditions \nincluding: transient ischaemic attack and stroke, abdomi-\nnal aortic aneurysm, respiratory infections, psychiat -\nric disorders, skin conditions, hearing loss, and familial \nconditions (one or two publications on each). Some tools \nwere also designed to support general delivery of care \nacross a range of domains such as maternal and child \nhealth, occupational health, behavioural health, and geri -\natric home care.\nA third of articles (31) utilised purely qualitative meth -\nods, almost all of which included interviews and/or focus \ngroups with health professionals. One exception reported \nconversation analysis of audio- and video-recorded con -\nsultations and another study reported observations of \nconsultations. Twenty-eight articles reported quantita -\ntive methods; 23 involved a survey of health profession -\nals and/or analysis of EMR data or usage data from the \ninvestigated tool. The other quantitative articles included \nthree randomised controlled trials and two observational \nstudies. The remaining 28 articles utilised mixed meth -\nodologies. The majority of these involved either a survey \nof health professionals plus qualitative interviews/focus \ngroups (n = 12) or an analysis of EMR/tool usage data in \naddition to qualitative interviews, focus groups and/or \nobservations (n = 15). Four further articles were system -\natic reviews, two involving qualitative synthesis and one \nbeing a mixed-methods narrative review. All included \narticles are summarised in the data extraction table \n(Table 1).\nWorkload‑related findings\nThe scoping review had the broad aim of identifying evi -\ndence regarding impacts on workload and workflow; evi -\ndence most frequently reported these issues in terms of \ntime and consultation durations. Findings from articles \nrelating to perceived and objectively-measured impacts \non either the time spent interacting with an eCDS tool \nor on whole consultation durations are summarised first \n(also in Table  2). Findings from articles that reported \nother workload-relevant results are summarised after.\nPerceived impacts on consultation duration\nSeventy-two articles described impacts on consultation \nduration. These were gathered from qualitative interviews \nor focus groups with health professionals, often with the \naim of identifying barriers and facilitators to implement -\ning eCDS tools in practice. In spite of the wide range of \ncontexts and functionalities of eCDS tools encompassed \nwithin this review, the majority of articles indicated that \nusing an eCDS tool was thought to be associated with an \nincrease in consultation duration (n = 36). Some showed \na mix of views among health professionals (n = 20). Six \narticles reported an overall impression that an eCDS \ntool reduced or ‘saved’ time within the consultation. The \nremaining articles either indicated no perceived impact \non consultation duration (n = 4) or made no explicit con-\nclusion (n = 7).\nPerceived increase in consultation duration\nAmong the 36 articles that indicated a perceived increase \nin consultation duration, the most commonly highlighted \nconcerns related to existing time pressures and lack \nof time during a consultation for clinicians to interact \nwith eCDS tools and/or to carry out resultant recom -\nmended actions [16, 27, 28, 30, 36, 41, 47, 76, 93, 96, 97, \n100, 102, 110, 111, 115, 123]. A prevalent view was that \nworkload was ‘already heavy’ and that using eCDS tools \nwould inevitably add burden [31, 44, 49, 60, 70, 78, 89, \n102, 111, 115, 123]. In the case of one tool to support \ndelivery of preventive care through review of patients’ \nlifestyle factors, the sense of lack of time for preventive \ncare in general drove the view towards the tool increasing \nconsultation duration [31]. Hirsch et al.

BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \npoor- or slow-functioning software [35, 37, 60, 104] were \nalso highlighted. A potential for negative impact of eCDS \ntools on the trajectory of the conversation with patients \nwas expressed by some health professionals. Some \nexpressed concerns that introducing unexpected discus -\nsion, such as addressing the risk of cancer, would over -\ntake the allotted consultation time and cause clinics to \nrun late [15, 33, 53, 92].\nAmong these 36 articles, a wide range of eCDS tools \nwith varying features and functionality were described \n(some overlapping). Thirteen involved tools which could \ninterrupt the consultation, by presenting an on-screen \nalert containing risk or safety information, triggered by \nopening the EMR or by inputting diagnosis or prescrip -\ntion details [27, 28, 36, 53, 59, 78, 83, 89, 92, 93, 100, 104, \n117, 131]. In addition, ten of these articles specifically \nhighlight the issue of the tool directing the clinician’s \nattention towards a condition or matter that was not the \nreason for the encounter [27, 28, 33, 36, 53, 60, 63, 83, \n100, 102, 104]. This was seen as necessitating additional \ntime and/or workload, as a result of requiring prolonged \ndiscussion with the patient, serving as a distraction, and \nadding more tasks to already busy consultations. An \neCDS tool flagging an issue that did not match the reason \nfor the encounter could be unhelpful if seen as an ‘unwel-\ncome intrusion’ [105], or if undermining a clinician’s \nprofessional expertise (particularly if there are doubts \nregarding the tool’s accuracy [51]) [105]. Such percep -\ntions would be barriers to using or responding to such \ntools [51, 53, 60, 104]. Arranging a follow-up consulta -\ntion in order to allow time for additional discussion and \ntasks was cited as an option for overcoming such barriers \n[27, 33].\nThirteen articles presented non-interruptive eCDS \ntools, accessed by a clinician at any time, used to obtain \ninformation, decision support or risk calculation, either \nfor individual patients or as an audit tool used across the \npractice population [15, 30–35, 37, 41, 44, 49, 97, 123]. \nTable 2 Summary of key findings from qualitative and quantitative evidence\nKeywords identified from initial search:\n•General practice / primary care\n•Decision [making] [support]\n•Computer / Online / Electronic\n•Tool / System / Prompt\n•Risk [assessment]\n•Consultation / appointment\nDurations of consultations when using eCDS tools Potential explanatory factors highlighted\nPerceived duration (mainly qualitative studies) n = 72\nPerceived increase in duration (n = 36) [15, 16, 27, 28, 30–32, 34–37, \n41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 61, 71, 77, 78, 83, 89, 92, 93, 96, 97, 101, 102, 104, \n107, 110, 112, 115, 117, 124]\nExisting time/workload pressures [16, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 41, 44, 47, 50, 71, 77, 78, 89, \n93, 96, 97, 101, 104, 107, 110, 112, 115, 117, 124, 131]; eCDS tools will add burden \n[92, 104]\nNo time for preventive care [32]\nWorkflow disruption [30, 83, 93, 102, 104]; interruptive alerts/functions [117]\nSlow software [35, 37, 61]; being a separate system to EMR [16, 34, 71]\nChange to the trajectory of conversation with patient [15, 53, 104]\nIncreased consultation duration might be ‘acceptable’ in some cases\nPerceived decrease in duration (n = 6) [62, 67, 67, 131] eCDS tools that were seen to improve efficiency [62, 69, 81]\nTools designed to support patient management (rather than diagnosis) [69, 81, 98, \n118]\nTools that were embedded in the EMR [62, 81, 118]\nReduced need for data entry [81, 98]\nFitting with usual workflow [118]\nPerception of no impact on duration (n = 4) [42, 63, 114, 127] No obvious explanatory factors highlighted\nLow number of instances where a cardiovascular (CV) risk eCDS tool indicated \nhigh risk [63]\nTools that guide the whole consultation and that were non-interruptive [42, 108, \n127]\nObjectively-measured duration (mainly quantitative studies) n = 26\n Increased duration (n = 3) [38, 54, 117] An eCDS tool which took longer than the length of a typical consultation [54]\n Decreased duration (n = 4) [116, 120–122] eCDS tools that helped speed up certain tasks, e.g. calculating CV risk [116, 120] \nand clinical decision-making, asthma chart review [121]\nTools designed to support management rather than diagnosis [116, 121, 122]\n No impact on duration (n = 9) [40, 48, 57, 84, 95, 103, 109, 119] Fitting in with usual workflow 100\nLow usage of the study tool\nPage 33 of 41\nFletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \n \nEight articles described systems that were standalone \nfrom the EMR such as web-based eCDS tools [15, 16, 31, \n32, 34, 37, 44, 49].\nPerceived decrease in consultation duration\nThe six articles that reported a perceived decrease in con-\nsultation duration suggested explanations which included \nreduced need for data entry [62, 81, 98], synchronisation \nwith the usual workflow of decision-making [118] and \nsaving time when discussing risk management of spe -\ncific conditions during the consultation [67, 68]. In terms \nof the purpose, feature and functionality of the studied \neCDS tools, the articles referred mainly to tools that \nwere seen to improve efficiency, four of which featured \na tool designed to support clinicians in the management \nof conditions, rather than on their diagnosis. All of the \ntools described were either embedded within the EMR \nsystem or linked/interacted with the EMR in some way. \nTwo included an interruptive component among other \nfunctions [67, 68] and two were entirely user-accessed \n[62, 81].\nNo perceived impact on consultation duration\nNo specific causal factors were suggested by the articles \nthat reported an overall perception of no impact on con -\nsultation duration. One study of a cardiovascular risk \nassessment tool highlighted that consultation duration \nwas perceived to be increased in cases where the GP did \nnot expect the patient’s risk to be high, however the num-\nber of such instances was low [63]. A study involving both \na survey and interviews with US physicians about a fam -\nily history data collection tool showed that none reported \nan adverse impact on their workflow [127]. In terms of \nthe studied eCDS tools’ purpose, features and functional -\nity, the tools described included one with an interruptive \ncomponent (cardiovascular risk score alert [63]) and two \nthat were non-interruptive: a tool pre-populated by clinic \nstaff that generated an email to the physician one week \nahead of a patient’s visit to prioritise Chronic Kidney Dis-\nease care [42], and a computerised Family Health History \nCDS tool which included risk stratification [127].\nObjectively‑measured impacts on consultation duration\nTwenty-six articles reported an objective measure of \ntime. These included: (i) time spent using or interacting \nwith an eCDS tool (ranging from three seconds [73] to \nbetween 0.5–13  min [35, 50, 54, 84, 90, 116, 120, 121]) \nand/or (ii) consultation duration [30, 38, 40, 45, 48, 57, \n73, 79, 95, 103, 108, 109, 113, 114, 119, 122], including \none which measured time from triage to final disposition \ndecision [128].\nIncrease in consultation duration\nOverall, three articles suggested that consultation dura -\ntion increased, although none measured consultation \nduration directly. Two of these articles reported that \nthe time taken to use the eCDS tool was ‘too long’ for a \ntypical ten-minute consultation (four minutes [50] and \n13 min [54]), implying that consultation durations would \nincrease as a consequence. One of these two articles \nhighlighted the low rates of usage of the eCDS tool as an \nimportant consideration alongside the authors’ conclu -\nsion [49]. The third study also did not directly measure \ntime, but instead reported ‘visit type’ as a proxy meas -\nure of consultation duration; clinicians more often used \nthe eCDS tool in the longer, annual medical review visits \n(usually allotted 40 min in that study) than in the shorter, \nacute care visits [38].\nNo particular purpose, features, or functionality were \nshared by the eCDS tools described in these articles. In \naddition, none were highlighted as potential explana -\ntory factors for the concluded increase in consultation \nduration.\nDecrease in consultation duration\nFour articles suggested that consultation duration \ndecreased, noting that the eCDS tools helped clinicians \nto undertake specific tasks more quickly. Two found that \ncalculating cardiovascular risk scores and making clini -\ncal decisions, when assisted by an eCDS tool, was faster \n[116, 120], and another found a 7.3-min reduction in \ntime within an asthma chart review consultation [121]. \nThe fourth reported consultations to be 3.41 min shorter \non average when using an eCDS tool to support diagnosis \nand management of hypertension [122]. All of the tools \nfeatured in these articles supported clinicians in the man-\nagement of long-term conditions by design, or included \nan element of management support, as opposed to solely \nsupporting initial risk assessment and/or diagnosis. All \nbar one described tools that were embedded with the \nEMR system, with only one of these having an interrup -\ntive component [120].\nNo impact on consultation duration\nNine articles concluded that eCDS tools neither extended \nnor saved time in consultations. Having compared an \nintervention and control group or a set of baseline and \nintervention consultations, five articles reported no sig -\nnificant difference in consultation duration [40, 103, \n108, 109, 128]. Lafata et  al. (2016) found no association \nbetween use of a range of eCDS tools with the consulta -\ntion duration. [57] The remaining articles reported that \ntheir measure of duration when using various eCDS tools \n(9.05 min [48] and 10 min [95]) was ‘similar’ in length to \na standard consultation, concluding that the tools did not \nPage 34 of 41Fletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \nprolong consultations [119]. The remaining articles did \nnot make any stated conclusion regarding duration or the \nconclusion was unclear [79, 84, 90, 114, 130].\nA common explanation for lack of impact on consulta -\ntion duration, or where perceptions of such impacts were \nmixed, was low rates of tool usage by clinicians in stud -\nies. Suggested reasons for non-use included perceived or \nactual difficulties in the tool’s functionality, slow-func -\ntioning software [30, 35, 37, 61], disruption to the usual \nworkflow in a consultation [30, 83, 93] or requiring addi-\ntional data entry to what would normally be inputted to \nthe EMR, particularly where eCDS tools operated as a \nstandalone system [34, 71].\nIn terms of purpose, features, and functionality of the \ntools described by these articles, while one article dis -\ncussed only a stand-alone system from the EMR [95], \nthe other articles reported either a tool embedded in the \nEMR system or described a range of both embedded and \nstand-alone systems. None of the described tools had an \ninterruptive component. Most were guiding or support -\ning either prescribing tasks or decision making during \nconsultations with a focus on patient management.\nConflict between perceived and objectively‑measured \nimpacts on consultation duration\nSeven articles reported both perceived and objectively-\nmeasured impacts on consultation duration of using \neCDS tools. Two found that both their perceived and \nobjective measures suggested increased duration [50, \n114]. However, five indicated a conflict between the per -\nceived and objectively-measured impacts [30, 35, 45, \n73, 108]. The common perception was that consultation \nduration was (or would be) increased, but there was actu-\nally no measurable difference in duration found. All of \nthe tools described by these five articles were embedded \nwith the EMR system, and did not include an interruptive \nalert feature or pertain to conditions or tasks likely to be \nirrelevant to the consultation.\nTrafton et  al. (2010) described physicians’ percep -\ntions that eCDS for prescribing opioid therapy was ‘too \ntime-consuming’ , with insufficient time available during \na 15-min consultation to use it [73]. However, the meas -\nured time spent using the tool ranged from 3 s to 10 min, \nand the study concluded that clinicians had ‘a reasonable \namount of time’ to use the system. Curry & Reed (2011) \nreported that physicians felt the time taken for an eCDS \nsystem to interact with the EMR was ‘too slow’ despite \nthe captured duration for this interaction being less than \none second, although it is unclear whether this reflects \nphysicians’ views of the overall interaction time rather \nthan data processing time specifically [35]. Bauer et  al. \n(2013) reported that although primary care clinic staff  \nfelt that a paediatric visit eCDS system slowed down \nclinics, an “informal” time study did not show any signifi-\ncant delays [30].\nPorat et  al. (2017) reported that 13 GPs (38%) felt \ntheir consultations took longer when using an eCDS \nsystem. They felt that inputting free text into the EMR \ninstead was faster, and these same GPs did indeed have \nlonger consultations when using the tool (an average of \n15.45 min compared with their baseline 13.53 min aver -\nage consultations). However, this was the case only for \nthe GPs who expressed concern about time, and not for \nthe GP sample as a whole where no significant difference \nin consultation duration was observed.\nFurther, a study by Gregory et al. (2017) found that the \nperception of physicians regarding the time available to \nmanage eCDS alerts (termed ‘subjective workload’) was \nnot correlated with actual hours spent managing alerts \nbased on physicians’ self-report (‘objective workload’) \n[46]. When the authors examined whether these ‘subjec -\ntive’ or ‘objective’ workload measures predicted physician \nburnout, only the ‘subjective’ measure was predictive. \nThis suggests that the perception of eCDS alert burden \nin the context of existing high workload is more prob -\nlematic than the measure of actual time spent managing \nalerts.\nMethods utilised to measure consultation duration\nA range of methods was utilised to measure objectively \nconsultation duration or the time spent using an eCDS \ntool. In five articles, clinicians provided a self-report of \ntime spent, using either a paper or electronic case report \nform [45, 95, 114, 121, 122]. A member of the research \nteam manually timed the duration of study consulta -\ntions or scenarios in four articles. [40, 54, 57, 73] Five \narticles reported time data captured electronically from \nlog files within the eCDS tool itself, including clinician \ntime spent using particular elements of the tool or com -\npleting certain activities [35, 50, 73, 84, 90]. Three arti -\ncles described using specialist software, operating in the \nbackground, designed to record users’ interactions with \nthe eCDS tool during consultations [116, 119, 120]. Spe-\ncific software included Morae Recorder and Camtasia, \nboth TechSmith Corporation products. Three studies \nused video- or audio-recordings to capture consultation \ndurations in addition to other elements of the consulta -\ntion they aimed to observe [48, 80, 113]. Two articles that \nreferred to the same core UK study, described captur -\ning duration data from the practice IT system (Vision), \nbased on the opening and closing of the EMR [108, 109]. \nOne USA study estimated consultation duration based \non the reasons patients were attending – either for a \n‘shorter’ visit, such as for acute care or follow-up, or for \na ‘longer’ visit, such as for a general medical examination \nPage 35 of 41\nFletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \n \n[38], and two articles provided insufficient details of the \nmethods used [30, 117].\nOther workload‑related findings\nTwenty-seven articles included additional workload-\nrelated findings. Twenty-three of these reported the \nimpact on ‘workflow’ , regarding how eCDS tools altered \nthe usual order in which patient-related tasks were carried \nout [33, 35, 39, 40, 47, 58, 66, 74, 75, 83, 84, 87, 91, 93, 94, \n100, 102–104, 111, 113, 118, 119, 127]. Five referred to the \nimpact of using eCDS tools on the trajectory of dialogue \nwith patients, to the extent that follow-up appointments \nwere arranged to avoid consultations running late [15, 39, \n75, 94, 100]. One of these mentioned clinicians’ concerns \nabout ‘taking time away’ from other waiting patients, \nexpressed as a barrier to the implementation of eCDS sys-\ntems [26]. Many of the tools in these articles were clearly \ndescribed as having an interruptive alert component [33, \n58, 83, 84, 86, 91, 93, 100, 104, 111, 118, 119].\nSome articles (n = 10) mentioned ‘alert fatigue’ indi -\ncating that eCDS tools designed to support health pro -\nfessionals can increase the number of on-screen alerts, \nleading to a high chance of them being missed or ignored \n[15, 36, 40, 42, 51, 74, 100, 105, 111, 117]. None of these \narticles reported a decrease in consultation duration.\nCognitive workload was referred to in three articles. \nQualitative interview data suggested that clinicians felt \nan eCDS tool for prescribing tuberculosis preventive \ntherapy decreased their cognitive workload during con -\nsultations. [98] This was perceived as advantageous as it \nreduced the amount of time spent documenting medi -\ncations and their contraindications. However, in two \narticles, eCDS tools were noted to increase cognitive \nworkload. A systematic review that examined factors \ninfluencing the appropriateness of interruptive alerts \nfound such alerts increased cognitive weariness, and that \nan ‘overload’ of alerts increased mental workload [117]. \nA study of an eCDS tool for assessing cardiovascular risk \nalso highlighted clinicians’ concerns about the cognitive \nburden of changing to a new way of calculating risk com -\npared with the conventional method they had used until \nthat point [124].\nOne study reported workload expressed as the num -\nber of follow-up consultations needed. This study exam -\nined eCDS tools for patients with upper respiratory tract \ninfections, and found no significant difference in the pro -\nportion of follow-ups needed between the intervention \nand control arms [82].\nDiscussion\nThis scoping review identified 95 articles that examined \nthe use of eCDS tools by health professionals in primary \ncare and reported findings that included impacts on \nworkload and workflow. While the scoping review had \nthe broad aim of identifying evidence regarding these \nissues, they were most frequently reported in terms of \ntime and consultation durations.. A large proportion of \nthe research was qualitative and exploratory in nature. \nThe majority of articles reported health professionals’ \nsubjective perceptions of time spent using eCDS tools \nand/or the impact on consultation duration and there \nwas a smaller evidence base which objectively-measured \nimpact of using eCDS tools on workload, specifically in \nrelation to consultation duration and the flow of consult -\ning sessions.\nThe reviewed literature reflected that although a small \nnumber of articles suggested that using certain types of \neCDS tool decreased consultation duration, a strong per -\nception exists among health professionals that consulta -\ntion duration was increased when eCDS tools were used. \nIt is worth noting that eCDS tools designed to support \nmanagement of health conditions and tools supporting \ndiagnosis and associated risk assessment may have differ-\nent impacts on consultation workload and duration; the \nsmall number of reviewed articles that indicated a time \nsaving mostly featured tools designed to support patient \nmanagement. It is also notable that many of the articles \ndescribing tools that introduced a condition or issue that \nwas outside of the patient’s or clinician’s agenda for the \nconsultation, frequently reported clinicians’ perceptions \nthat workload and/or consultation duration increased.\nThe perception that consultation duration was increased \nis not necessarily backed by studies that objectively meas-\nured actual durations of consultations. Although many \nof the quantitative articles reported the time taken to \nuse various eCDS tools within consultations, fewer stud -\nies captured the duration of entire consultations and/or \nmade a comparison between an intervention and non-\nintervention group. Interestingly, those that did showed \nno significant difference in consultation duration when \nusing eCDS tools compared with not using them [40, 103, \n108, 109, 128]. Various methods were used to capture \nconsultation durations, with no one method that seemed \nmost practical or accurate. For instance, while the manual \n(stopwatch) timing of consultations by a researcher [54, \n73] might arguably capture consultation durations more \naccurately than clinicians’ self-report, this method could \nbe seen as intrusive to the consultation. Capturing time \nstamp data in an automated way, for example from EMR \nsystems [108, 109], might address this issue and provide \na practical solution, but errors may be introduced by this \nmethod if patient records are left open after the end of a \nconsultation, or some part of the consultation takes place \nwhen records are closed.\nThe reviewed literature highlighted that low usage \nrates of eCDS tools by clinicians in studies (for \nPage 36 of 41Fletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \nvarying reasons) may be responsible for a lack of observ -\nable impact on workload or consultation duration. Con -\nversely, a tool that fits easily within the usual workflow \nof a consultation might explain the lack of increased \nduration. The experience of ‘alert fatigue’ was frequently \nmentioned; a large number of different on-screen alerts \nduring consultations can desensitise clinicians to alerts, \nand an alert generated by a new tool may be missed or \nignored [27, 28, 50]. Ignoring an alert or not utilising an \neCDS tool might indicate clinician’s preference to rely \non their own clinical judgment, or doubts as to an alert’s \naccuracy or relevance, which is particularly highlighted \nwithin the alert fatigue literature [36, 107, 132–134]. It \nmight equally be the case that a clinician did indeed uti -\nlise or respond to the eCDS tool, but arranged a follow-\nup appointment to allow for more time to discuss the \nclinical issues raised [26, 28, 33], thereby not impacting \nthe duration of the current consultation. Whether use of \neCDS tools had an impact on the duration of the health -\ncare ‘episode’ as a whole (i.e. the index consultation plus \nthe number and duration of any subsequent follow-up \nconsultations) was unclear from the reviewed articles.\nReviewing articles that included both a subjective \nmeasure of health professionals’ perceptions and an \nobjective measure of consultation duration provided an \nopportunity to observe if the perceptions were borne out \nin reality. These articles most commonly reported that \nhealth professionals felt consultations were (or would be) \nprolonged by using eCDS tools, but objective measures \ndid not consistently back this up [30, 35, 73]. However, \nthe evidence base for actual consultation durations asso -\nciated with using eCDS tools remains a lot smaller than \nthat of the perceived impacts on consultation durations. \nOne should note that the perception or expectation of \nhealth professionals in relation to consultation workload \nand duration is very important. Firstly, perceptions and \nexpectations may well determine how often eCDS tools \nare used. Secondly, ‘subjective’ workload (clinicians’ \nreported amount of time available to manage alerts), \nrather than ‘objective’ workload (the number of hours \nactually spent managing alerts), has been found to be \npredictive of physician burnout [45]. It is worth also not -\ning, however, that a perception or an objective measure \nof increased workload or duration may not always be \nviewed negatively; for example, it may not matter how \nmuch consultation duration is increased (if it is) if diag -\nnosis and/or management is improved [52].\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study benefits from undertaking a comprehensive \nliterature review addressing a key area of primary care \nservice provision, namely the interface between techno -\nlogically enhanced service provision in the form of eCDS, \nand clinical workload and workflow. We successfully \nidentified and summarised a large number of articles \npublished from a variety of international settings.\nThe review may have been affected by the inclusion of \nnames of specific eCDS tools within the search terms. \nThis reflects research team members’ awareness of exist -\ning systems in UK primary care; tools not known to the \nauthors may have been missed from the review. We identi-\nfied a number of studies through systematic reviews that \nwere not found through our initial searches, this suggests \nthat our initial searches may have missed some relevant \nwork. Inclusion of articles published in the last ten years, \nsince 2009, may also have omitted potentially-relevant \nresearch on eCDS since its inception in the 1960’s, how -\never we aimed to identify evidence from research articles \nbased in modern-day primary care settings In addition, \nalthough the vast majority of international scientific litera-\nture is currently published in English, our exclusion of for-\neign language articles may have prevented fuller coverage \nof non-UK primary care contexts with different standards \nof consultation lengths, workload or workforce challenges, \nand policy expectations. The review also included a large \nnumber of qualitative articles, but time and resource issues \nprevented a full qualitative synthesis of these articles.\nThe two independent reviewers who undertook screen-\ning were not always the same two reviewers due to \nresource constraints, however EF undertook all stages \nof the review and had regular discussions with the small \ngroup of four ‘second’ reviewers. Only EF undertook data \nextraction and so details from included articles may have \nbeen affected by selection bias.\nConclusion\nThis scoping review identified over 90 articles that explored \nthe use of eCDS tools in primary care by health profession-\nals in relation to aspects of workload, including consulta -\ntion duration. Whilst the qualitative literature showed a \nstrong perception among health professionals that eCDS \ntools increased workload and consultation duration, a \nsmaller number of studies captured quantitative measures, \nwhich neither disputed nor supported this view.\neCDS tools designed to support GPs will continue to \nbe introduced within primary care with the aim of assist -\ning clinicians to diagnose and manage patients effec -\ntively. Despite the absence of strong objective evidence \nthat using eCDS tools necessarily leads to increased (or \ndecreased) consultation durations, the perceptions of \nadditional time being taken within consultations, addi -\ntional workload being generated, and workflow being dis-\nrupted, are barriers to implementation and routine use of \neCDS tools, irrespective of their potential benefit in the \ndiagnosis or management of patients.\nPage 37 of 41\nFletcher et al. BMC Primary Care           (2023) 24:23 \n \nFurther quantitative evidence measuring actual con -\nsultation duration and GP workload is needed to confirm \nwhether the reported concerns are justifiable, particu -\nlarly in the time-constrained setting of primary care. \nFuture efforts to implement potentially valuable eCDS \ntools need to take account of the context of increasing \nGP workload, workforce shortages and associated pres -\nsures, and the ongoing challenges generated in the wake \nof COVID-19.\nAbbreviations\nCDS  Clinical decision support\neCDS  Electronic clinical decision support\nEMR  Electronic medical record\nGP  General practitioner\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Sophie Robinson who helped design the database \nsearches.\nAuthors’ contributions\nEF participated in study design, wrote the protocol, undertook screening, \nfull-text review, data extraction and analysis, and wrote the paper.
