    "abstract": "This paper presents an intelligent technique to fault diagnosis of power transformers dissolved and free gas analysis (DGA). Fuzzy Reasoning Spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems) as a membrane computing with distributed parallel computing model is powerful and suitable graphical approach model in fuzzy diagnosis knowledge. In a sense this feature is required for establishing the power transformers faults identifications and capturing knowledge implicitly during the learning stage, using linguistic variables, membership functions with \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" descriptions for each gas signature, and inference rule base. Membership functions are used to translate judgments into numerical expression by fuzzy numbers. The performance method is analyzed in terms for four gas ratio (IEC 60599) signature as input data of FRSN P systems. Test case results evaluate that the proposals method for power transformer fault diagnosis can significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy power transformer.",
