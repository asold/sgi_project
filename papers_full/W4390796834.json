In this study, we\ncompared the brains of tool-using wrasses with various teleost species. We show that in the\ntool-using wrasses, the telencephalon and the ventral part of the forebrain and midbrain are\nsigniﬁcantly enlarged compared to other teleost species but do not contain a larger pro-\nportion of cells. Instead, this size difference is due to largeﬁber tracts connecting the dorsal\npart of the telencephalon (pallium) to the inferior lobe, a ventral mesencephalic structure\nabsent in amniotes. The high degree of connectivity between these structures in tool-using\nwrasses suggests that the inferior lobe could contribute to higher-order cognitive functions.\nWe conclude that the evolution of non-telencephalic structures might have been key in the\nemergence of these cognitive functions in teleosts.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05663-8 OPEN\n1 Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience (NeuroPSI), Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS UMR9197, Saclay 91400, France.2 TEFOR Paris-Saclay, CNRS UAR2010,\nUniversité Paris-Saclay, Saclay 91400, France.3 Laboratory of Fish Biology, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-\n8601, Japan.4 Institute for Advanced Research, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.5Present address: Université Paris-Saclay, UVSQ, EnvA, INRAE,\nBREED, Jouy-en-Josas 78350, France.✉email: kei.yamamoto@cnrs.fr\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|            (2024) 7:88 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05663-8 | www.nature.com/commsbio 1\n1234567890():,;\nI\nn primates, the cerebral cortex is the center for higher-order\ncognition such as logical thinking or self-recognition. How-\never, some birds, such as corvids and parrots, demonstrate\ncomparable cognitive functions, even though they do not possess\nthis six-layered cortical structure\n1,2. Remarkable behaviors indi-\ncative of so-called higher-order cognition include tool use 3,4,\nwhich requires abilities of causal reasoning, planning, as well as\nﬁne object manipulation.\nEncephalization, the increased relative mass of the brain\ncompared to body mass5, has long been used as a proxy for\nintelligence in vertebrates, with highly encephalized species con-\nsidered more intelligent6,7. Despite the high degree of encepha-\nlization in corvids and parrots, cognitive abilities in birds have\nlong been underestimated due to their rather small brains com-\npared to mammals. A more recent cell counting study has in fact\nrevealed that the brains of parrots and songbirds are extremely\nneuron-dense and contain on average twice as many neurons as\nprimate brains of the same mass8. Thus, some species of corvids\nand parrots have as many neurons in their pallium (the dorsal\ntelencephalon that contains the cerebral cortex in mammals) as\nsome species of primates8. This strongly suggests that mammals\nand birds have followed two independent trajectories of ence-\nphalization: an increase in cortical surface in mammals (with the\ncortex reaching a very large size in humans), and an increase in\nthe neuronal density of the pallium in birds. Both trajectories led\nto an increase in the absolute number of telencephalic neurons in\nhighly encephalized species of mammals and birds compared to\npoorly encephalized ones. In other words, encephalization in\namniotes (the clade containing mammals and birds) is mostly a\nprocess of “telencephalization“8– 10.\nTeleost brains are generally much less encephalized compared\nto amniotes5. Nonetheless, some teleost ﬁshes belonging to the\nfamily of wrasses (Labridae) exhibit tool use-like behavior11. Due\nto the lack of grasping appendages in teleosts, the only way of\nusing a “tool” is holding it in their mouth. In most cases of tool\nuse by wrasses, theﬁsh grasps a shellﬁsh (bivalves) in its jaws,\ntakes it to a feeding station that is equipped with appropriate\n“anvils” embedded in the substrate (corals or rocks), and then\ncrushes it open by repeated slamming against the anvil\n12– 14. Such\nbehavior does not appear to be a genetically programmed“ﬁxed\naction pattern”, since it can be observed also in captivity, in a\nslightly modiﬁed form. For example, some individuals ofTha-\nlassoma hardwicke held in an aquarium use an anvil to smash a\nlarge pellet of food into more manageable pieces15. Interestingly,\nthese tool use-like behaviors are observed uniquely in the group\nof wrasses (the family ofLabridae) in teleosts. Thus, the brain\nanatomy of wrasses and their close relatives is of great interest to\nunderstand the evolution of tool-using behavior and its related\nhigher-order cognitive functions.\nOur developmental studies have shown that the telencephalon,\nhypothalamus, and sensory nuclei of teleosts16– 20 differ greatly\nfrom amniotes. Indeed, teleost brain organization appears to be\nmuch less conserved than previously thought. Notably, teleosts\npossess a remarkable ventral structure called the inferior lobe,\nwhich is absent in tetrapod brains and whose functions remain\nlargely unknown\n21. At a gross morphological level, the ventral\nparts of the teleost brain appear much more developed in com-\nparison to amniote brains.\nThese observations raise the question of how encephalization\noccurred in the teleost lineage, and how the brains of teleosts with\nremarkable cognitive abilities, such as wrasses, may differ from\nother species. Is the teleost pallium the brain center that is\nresponsible for higher-order cognitive functions, similar to the\namniote brain?\nIn order to uncover which brain structures are expanded in\nteleost species demonstrating complex behavioral repertoires, we\nexamined the cellular composition of their major brain regions\nand compared them with other teleost species located at various\nphylogenetic positions. We also compared the connectivity of the\npallium in encephalized and poorly encephalized species. Our\nquantitative and qualitative study revealed that, unlike in\namniotes, the ventral part of the brain including the inferior lobe\nis signiﬁcantly developed in the brains of tool-using species, in\nwhich the inferior lobe is heavily connected to the pallium. This\nillustrates how encephalization in teleosts and amniotes followed\ndifferent evolutionary paths.\nResults\nThe tool-using wrasseChoerodon anchorago has more cells in\nits brain than a hamster twice its body mass. The body mass\nand brain mass were measured for 11 species of teleost: a group of\nthree wrasse species (Choerodon anchorago, Labroides dimidiatus,\nThalassoma hardwicke), a group of four cichlid species (May-\nlandia zebra, Neolamprologus brichardi, Ophthalmotilapia boops,\nAmatitlania nigrofasciata), and a group of four other species (the\nmedaka (Oryzias latipes), zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio), Astyanax sur-\nface ﬁsh (Astyanax mexicanus), and trout (Salmo trutta), here-\nafter referred to as the “outgroup”) (Fig. 1, see “Methods”\nsection). Total number of cells in the brain was determined using\nthe isotropic fractionator (see“Methods” section).\nRemarkably complex behaviors have been reported in the\ngroup of wrasses: tool use in the case ofC. anchorago13 and T.\nhardwicke15, and complex social cognition (e.g., altruism and\npunishment) in the case of L. dimidiatus 22– 25. In cichlids,\nalthough no instances of tool use have been observed, many\nspecies demonstrate complex social interaction with parental\ncare\n26– 28, and there are several studies reporting cognitive\nFig. 1 Phylogenetic tree of the teleost species sampled in this study.In this study, we refer to the medaka, trout,Astyanax, and zebraﬁsh as the\n“outgroup”. Numbers at the root of each tree branches represent the estimated time of divergence (MYA: million years ago). The last common ancestor of\nthese species can be traced back to 224 million years ago (http://www.timetree.org84).\nARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05663-8\n2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|            (2024) 7:88 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05663-8 | www.nature.com/commsbio\nabilities such as individual recognition, quantity discrimination,\nand transitive inference29– 33.\nAmong the wrasses studied, body mass ranged from 1.55 to\n91.52 g, brain mass from 34.62 to 338.8 mg, and total number of\ncells in the brain from 45.7 to 185.08 million (Table1). Wrasses\nwere wild caught and were generally young adults (estimated by\nmorphology); however, one large adult ofC. anchorago, weighing\naround ten times as much as the other individuals, was also\nsampled. Excluding this large specimen from the analyses did not\naffect the statistical signiﬁcance of the observed results, so we\nincluded it in the main analyses presented here (Supplementary\nFigs. 1– 3 show the data excluding the large specimen; see also\nTable 1, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary File 1). In\ncichlids, body mass ranged from 5.15 to 20.28 g, brain mass from\n42.43 to 96.94 mg and total number of cells in the brain from\n37.54 to 61.78 million (Table1). In the “outgroup”, body mass\nranged from 0.492 to 177.15 g, brain mass from 8.38 to\n354.73 mg, and total number of cells in the brain from 6.66 to\n100.84 million (Table1). Overall, the specimens used in this study\nwere rather small, and future studies using larger indidivuals\nwould be useful to conﬁrm our results.\nCompared to previously published data, teleosts have smaller\nbrains than birds, primates or rodents of similar body mass\n(Fig. 2a). By contrast, teleost brains contain more cells than the\nbrains of rodents of similar body mass, albeit not as many as birds\nand primates, (Fig.2b). For instance, the brain of the tool-using\nwrasse C. anchorago contains on average more cells than the\nbrain of the nearly two times heavier hamster (Cricetus cricetus).\nCellular density inside the teleost brain is higher than in birds\nand mammals, with teleosts having as many cells as rodent brains\nmore than four times larger (Fig.2c). For example, the largeC.\nanchorago individual sampled had 301.9 million cells in its brain,\nnearly as many cells as a rat (Rattus norvegicus), even though its\nbrain is 2.6 times lighter.\nEncephalization and relative mass or number of cells in the\ntelencephalon of teleosts are not correlated. Residuals obtained\nby ﬁtting a log10-log10 regression of brain mass against body mass\ndata from this dataset with previously published data on acti-\nnopterygians (Fig.3) using a phylogenetic generalized least square\n(PGLS) model ranged from−0.142 (D. rerio) to 0.38 (the wrasse\nT. hardwicke), with only one other species (C. anchorago) with a\nresidual >0.30 (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). Excluding the\nlarge C. anchorago from our analysis gave a residual of 0.488 for\nC. anchorago, placing it above T. hardwicke (Supplementary\nTable 1, see Supplementary File 1). Overall, these two tool-using\nspecies were the most encephalized of our dataset.\nIn order to compare the degree of encephalization with the\nrelative mass and cellular composition of major brain regions, the\nbrains of ten species were dissected intoﬁve parts (Fig.4a): the\ntelencephalon (Tel), the optic tectum (TeO), the rest of the\nForebrain/Midbrain (rForeMid; which includes the inferior lobe),\nthe cerebellum (Cb) and the rest of the Hindbrain (rHind)\nfollowing the rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral axis (Fig.4b– e, See\n“Methods” section). These structures were weighed and the\nnumber of cells contained in each structure was determined using\nthe isotropic fractionator34. No statistically signiﬁcant correla-\ntions were found between encephalization and the relative mass\nand relative number of cells of the Tel, TeO, rForeMid, Cb\n(Supplementary Fig. 4a– d). The only structure that showed a\nstatistically signiﬁcant correlation with encephalization was the\nrHind (Supplementary Fig. 4e), with a negative correlation for\nboth the relative mass and relative number of cells (See Methods).\nThis indicates that more encephalized species of teleosts have a\nrelatively smaller rHind containing a relatively smaller number of\ncells.\nThese results suggest that teleost brains have evolved very\ndifferently from amniote brains. Unlike in mammals and birds,\nencephalized species of teleosts don’t have an extremely large Tel.\nWrasses have a relatively larger Tel and rForeMid, but not a\nlarger relative number of cells compared to other teleosts.\nComparing species in a one-to-one manner didn’t reveal any\nconsistent differences in either the relative mass or relative\nnumber of cells across structures (Supplementary Fig. 5, See\nMethods). However, a trend towards larger Tel and rForeMid was\nobserved when examining wrasses as a whole (Supplementary\nFig. 5). Wrasses have large brains and display the mostﬂexible\nbehavioral repertoires, including tool use. We thus aimed to\ninvestigate any differences in their brain morphology compared\nto the other teleosts. To this end, the relative mass and number of\ncells in theﬁve major regions of the brains of all wrasse species\nwere compared with those of the other species of teleosts sampled\nin this study (Fig.5).\nThe relative mass of the Tel and rForeMid was signiﬁcantly\nhigher in wrasses compared to other teleosts, with the Tel\naccounting for 24.11% ± 3.78% of total brain mass in wrasses\ncompared to 15.43% ± 3.74% in other species (Fig.5a).

The relative mass of the\nCb and rHind were signiﬁcantly lower in wrasses compared to\nother teleosts (Fig.5d, e). No signiﬁcant difference was found in\nthe relative mass of the TeO between the two groups (Fig.5b).\nDespite the larger size of the Tel and rForeMid in wrasses,\nisotropic fractionator data revealed that there is no signiﬁcant\ndifference in the relative number of cells in these two structures\ncompared to other species. The Tel accounted for 12.02% ± 6.04%\nof total brain cells in wrasses compared to 8.49% ± 2.54% in other\nspecies (Fig.5f), while the rForeMid accounted for 12.04% ± 2.76%\nof total brain cells in wrasses and 12.39% ± 2.47% in other species\n(Fig. 5h). No signiﬁcant difference in relative number of cells was\nfound in either the Cb (Fig.5i) or TeO (Fig. 5g), whereas the\nrHind (Fig. 5j) accounted for a signi ﬁcantly smaller relative\nnumber of cells in wrasses compared to other species\n(2.18% ± 0.64% and 5.41% ± 1.64%, respectively).\nSimilar results were obtained when comparing cichlids to the\n“outgroup” (Supplementary Fig. 6, See «Methods» section).\nCichlids had a slightly larger relative number of cells in the\nrForeMid compared to the “outgroup”, but there was no\nsigniﬁcant difference with wrasses.\nOverall, these results show that wrasses have a relatively larger\nTel and rForeMid compared to other teleosts. However, these two\nstructures do not contain a larger proportion of cells than in other\nteleosts.\nPallium and inferior lobe display increased connectivity in\nwrasses compared to other teleosts. We hypothesized that the\nincrease in mass observed in the Tel and rForeMid of wrasses is\ndue to an increase in the neuropil of these structures. To verify\nthis hypothesis, we performed selective visualization of theﬁbers\nin the Tel and rForeMid. Whole brains of the wrasse C.\nanchorago, the cichlid N. brichardi, the trout S. trutta, the\nAstyanax surface ﬁsh A. mexicanus, and the zebraﬁsh D. rerio\nwere cleared, stained with DiI, and imaged on a light-sheet\nmicroscope (Fig. 6, Supplementary Movies 1– 5, See «Methods»\nsection).\n3D reconstruction of the DiI-stained ﬁbers in the Tel and\nrForeMid of wrasses and cichlids revealed the presence of\nenriched ﬁber labeling in the Tel and rForeMid. Most of the\ninferior lobe, the ventral-most part of the rForeMid, exhibited\nhigh ﬁber density in wrasses (Fig.6a, Supplementary Movie 1; in\npurple), while ﬁber labeling was sparse in the other species\nexamined (trout, Fig. 6c, Supplementary Movie 2; Astyanax\nFig. 2 Teleosts have small, cell-dense brains that contain more cells than the brains of rodents of similar body mass.The ﬁtted reduced major axis\n(RMA) regression lines are displayed only for correlations that are signiﬁcant.

Theseﬁbers converge onto the lateral\nforebrain bundle as they exit the telencephalon and then split\nagain into two major tracts (Fig.6a, Supplementary Movie 1; in\ngreen and magenta). These connect the pallium and the\nstructures in and around the inferior lobe (in an area which we\nrefer to as the lobar region, Fig.4f,g), and we thus refer to these\ntwo tracts as “pallio-lobar tracts”. The ventrally located tract\n(Fig. 6a, Supplementary Movie 1; in green) directly connects the\npallium and the ventral inferior lobe ipsilaterally. The dorsally\nlocated tract (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Movie 1; in magenta)\ncourses near the midline ipsilaterally and connects the pallium\nwith a structure called the nucleus preglomerulosus pars\ncommissuralis (PGc) in the lobar region, as well as sending\nminute ﬁbers to the inferior lobe that run through the periphery\nof an oval-shaped structure called the corpus glomerulosum pars\nrotunda (GR). The same tracts are also present in the cichlid\nbrain, albeit more modestly, with a much smaller ﬁber\narborization in both the pallium and inferior lobe (Fig. 6b,\nSupplementary Movie 5; in green and magenta). Strikingly, in\ntrout, zebraﬁsh, and Astyanax surface ﬁsh, these tracts were not\ndetectable, and only minimal arborization was found in the\npallium and the inferior lobe (Fig. 6c– e, Supplementary\nMovies 2– 4). Both PGc and GR are absent in those species,\nindicative of the poor development of their lobar region.\nTract tracing studies using the lipophilic dye NeuroVue,\nbiocytin, and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA molecular weight\n3000) conﬁrmed the presence of connectivity between the pallium\nand the lobar region in the wrasse and cichlid brains\n(Supplementary Fig. 7, See «Methods» section). Biocytin injec-\ntions in the telencephalon (Supplementary Fig. 7a, white asterisk)\nallowed us to identify the direction of the projections. Abundant\nlabeled ﬁbers were found in the inferior lobe (Supplementary\nFig. 7b), while very few cell bodies were labeled (Supplementary\nFig. 7c, white arrows). This suggests that the majority of\nprojections are descendingﬁbers from the pallium to the inferior\nlobe, with only few ascendingﬁbers from the inferior lobe to the\npallium. Theseﬁbers reached the inferior lobe through the ventral\nbranch of the lateral forebrain bundle mentioned above.\nWhile pallio-lobar tracts were not detectable in zebraﬁsh with\n3D reconstruction of DiI labeledﬁbers, biocytin injections into\nthe dorsal telencephalon resulted in labeledﬁbers in the lateral\nforebrain bundle and terminal labeling in the inferior lobe of\nzebraﬁsh. This indicates that pallial connectivity with the inferior\nlobe is present in this species, albeit to a lesser extent than in\nwrasses and cichlids.\nThere are two additionalﬁber tracts observable in all species\nexamined. One contains projections from the sensory preglo-\nmerular complex to the pallium (Fig. 6, Supplementary\nMovies 1– 5; in orange)16,35, coursing rostrally and joining the\nlateral forebrain bundle. The most distinct branch of this tract\nterminates in the lateral zone of the dorsal telencephalic area (Dl)\ncarrying visual information16. In the pallium of wrasses and\ncichlids, these visual terminals (Fig.6a, b; orange) are embedded\nin the arborization of the ventral pallio-lobar tract (Fig.6a, b;\ngreen).\nThe other tract present in all species is the one connecting the\ninferior lobe with the pretectum (Fig. 6, Supplementary\nMovies 1– 5; in blue). In the trout, zebra ﬁsh, and Astyanax\nsurface ﬁsh, this is the major tract connecting the inferior lobe\nwith the rostral aspect of the brain. In the wrasse and cichlid\nbrain, the pretectal pathway to the inferior lobe is mediated by the\nGR (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Movie 1; in blue). This only\nrepresents a small proportion of inferior lobe connectivity in\nthose species, as the inferior lobe is also heavily connected with\nthe pallium.\nThe presence of very developed pallio-lobar tracts is unrelated\nto absolute or relative brain size, as these tracts were not\ndetectable in the large brained trout. Thus, the large quantity of\nﬁbers connecting the inferior lobe and the pallium in wrasses and\nFig. 3 Encephalization in 11 species of teleosts (red) compared to a large dataset of actinopterygians (blue).Brain mass is plotted as a function of body\nmass, and the phylogenetically corrected (phylogenetically generalized least squares regression test, PGLS) allometric line is shown.

This increase in the\nrelative quantity of ﬁbers in tool-using teleost species also\nparallels what has been observed in the mammalian telencepha-\nlon, where primates have a larger proportion of white matter\ncompared to rodents36,37.\nDiscussion\nMammals and birds have taken two different trajectories of\nencephalization that have converged onto a process of “tele-\nncephalization”, whereby the telencephalon (and in particular the\npallium) becomes massively enlarged in highly encephalized\nspecies. Our study shows that this is not the case in teleosts.\nSampling of a phylogenetically broad range of teleost species\nrevealed that encephalization in teleosts does not lead to an\nenlargement of most of the examined brain regions, both in terms\nof mass and relative number of cells. That is, there was no single\nparticularly prominent structure in highly encephalized teleosts\ncompared to less encephalized ones. Even in the tool-using spe-\ncies ( C. anchorago ), the telencephalon is of a modest size,\nrepresenting only 27.8% of total brain mass. This is in stark\ncontrast to amniotes, where the telencephalon makes up 80% of\ntotal brain mass in tool-using species of primates, parrots and\ncorvids8,38.\nCompared to amniotes, the rForeMid of teleosts is remarkably\nlarge. In previous amniote studies8,38, the brain structures cor-\nresponding to rForeMid, TeO and rHind were pooled together\nand called the “rest of brain” on account of their small relative\nsize compared to the telencephalon and cerebellum. While this\n“rest of brain” represents merely 10– 25% of total brain mass in\nprimates, parrots and corvids8,38, it does represent 61.1% in the\ntool-using wrasse C. anchorago. The modest telencephalon and\nthe large “rest of brain” of teleosts, even in relatively highly\nencephalized tool-using species, indicates that unlike in amniotes,\nencephalization in teleosts is not a process of telencephalization.\nIn contrast to these differences, mammalian and teleost brains\nhave in common an increase in white matter volume in tool-using\nspecies. In mammals, primates have a signiﬁcantly higher white\nmatter volume to gray matter volume ratio in the telencephalon\ncompared to rodents\n36,37. However, when compared to the\nnumber of neurons, rodents actually have more white matter per\nneuron than primates37. This is in part due to the axonal caliber\nincreasing in rodents as neurons are added to the cortex, while\naxonal caliber remains constant in primates39,40. On top of this,\nFig. 4 Illustration of brain structures of teleosts. a–e Dissection of theﬁve major structures for the isotropic fractionator visualized on the brain of the\ncichlid Neolamprologus brichardi. a Lateral external view of the brain of the cichlidNeolamprologus brichardi.

It would be interesting to know whether\nthe increased volume of white matter in wrasses compared to\ntrouts is due to the axonal caliber of neurons increasing (as in\nrodents) or rather to the increase in the absolute number of\nneurons, with axonal caliber remaining similar (as in primates).\nSimilarly, connectomics data in tool-using teleosts would help\nunderstand the nature of their network architecture: do wrasses\npossess a uniform network brain like rodents, or a small-world\nnetwork brain like primates ?\nOne limitation of our results describing the cellular composi-\ntion of the teleost brain is that we were only able to obtain total\ncell numbers for each structure, and we thus could not distinguish\nbetween neuronal and non-neuronal cell numbers like in the rest\nof the isotropic fractionator literature8,38. One interestingﬁnding\nfrom these studies is that non-neuronal cell density varies at most\nby one order of magnitude in amniotes, while neuronal density\nvaries by three orders of magnitude 42. If this non-neuronal\ndensity also holds for teleosts, it would indicate that teleosts have\nneuronal densities in their pallium higher or similar to those of\ncertain songbirds and parrots8,38,43. Future studies in teleosts\nshould help verify this hypothesis and shed more light on the\nfunctional consequences of high neuronal densities.\nThe rForeMid corresponds to the ventral part of the forebrain\nand midbrain, while the Tel and TeO represent the dorsal parts of\nthe forebrain and midbrain respectively. As the rForeMid is large\nin teleosts, accounting for a quarter to a third of total brain mass,\nit appears that teleost brains are a lot more“ventralized” com-\npared to amniote brains.\nThe lobar region (which includes the inferior lobe, GR, and\nPGc) in particular appeared to account for most of the rForeMid\nvolume. The inferior lobe was long considered to be of hypo-\nthalamic origin and used to be named the“inferior lobe of the\nhypothalamus” as a result. A recent study\n21 has demonstrated\nthat the developmental origin of the inferior lobe is in fact mainly\nmesencephalic, while the cell populations surrounding the lateral\nrecess of the hypothalamic ventricle, which represent a small part\nof the inferior lobe, are of hypothalamic origin. Bloch et al.21 has\nsuggested that in the species with a large inferior lobe, it is mainly\nthis mesencephalic part that becomes enlarged, and not the\nhypothalamic part.\nThe inferior lobe is especially enlarged in wrasses and cichlids.\nThe interpretation on the evolution of this structure largely\ndepends on the phylogenetic relationship of these groups.\nWrasses and cichlids have been considered as closest relatives,\nforming the group of“labroids”44. However, the divergence time\nobtained by TIMETREE5 (www.timetree.org), as well as other\npublications, show that they are relatively close, but not the clo-\nsest, and that cichlids are in fact closer to medaka45,46 (Fig. 1). As\nthe medaka does not appear to have a particularly developed\ninferior lobe, this raises the possibility that the enlargement of the\ninferior lobe may have occurred independently in different\ngroups of teleosts.\nGR forms the root of the lobar region in wrasses and cichlids. It\nis considered to have important sensory (especially visual)\nfunctions, and to project almost exclusively to the inferior\nlobe47– 49. Not only does GR have no homolog in tetrapod brains,\nit has only evolved in some groups of teleosts50. This also appears\nto be the case for PGc, and we thus consider GR and PGc as\nspecialized nuclei present only in groups of teleosts which possess\nlarge connectivity between the pallium and lobar region.\nAnother structure of the rForeMid that is also involved in\nsensory processing is the preglomerular complex, which is con-\nsidered to play a role equivalent to the amniote thalamic nucleus.\nAs our previous study has shown, it is mostly made up of cells of\na mesencephalic origin16. In that sense, it appears that teleost\nbrains are largely more mesencephalized than amniote brains.\nAltogether, sensory systems in teleosts and tetrapods are not as\nconserved as previously thought but have evolved independently\nin each lineage.\nTeleosts thus display marked differences in the organization of\ntheir brains compared to amniotes, with mesencephalic structures\naccounting for a much larger proportion of total brain mass and\nplaying a prominent role in sensory processing.\nOur current study revealed that in the wrasse and cichlid\nbrains, the inferior lobe is highly connected with the pallium. This\nseems to be especially apparent in tool-using species. As some\nprevious studies already suggested21,51, this challenges the pre-\nvious notion that the inferior lobe is merely a food motivation\ncenter52– 55. The inferior lobe receives gustatory\ninformation48,56– 58, and due to its position directly next to the\nhypothalamus, it was thought to be homologous to the lateral\nhypothalamus of mammals55. Direct electrical stimulation of the\ninferior lobe resulted in behaviors such as biting on a mirror or\nsnapping at objects in freely movingﬁsh52,53, and inferior lobe\nactivation was found during detection of moving objects in larval\nzebraﬁsh54. With the assumption that the inferior lobe was\nhomologous to the mammalian hypothalamus, these functional\ndata have been interpreted as the inferior lobe playing a role in\nfeeding behaviors. However, since this previous view of inferior\nlobe homology has been shown to be erroneous21, a reinterpre-\ntation of this data is necessary.\nIn addition to gustatory inputs, the inferior lobe receives visual\ninputs from the TeO via the pretectum47– 49,54. In the species\nwhere GR is present, it has been suggested that the inferior lobe\nalso receives auditory47 and somatosensory49 information. As a\nresult, the inferior lobe has also been proposed to be a multi-\nsensory integration center48,49,57,59. In addition, since its main\noutput is to the lateral valvular nucleus, which projects to the\ncerebellum48,60, its functions may be motor-related. This sensory\ninput and motor output connectivity pattern in the inferior lobe\nis rather similar to what has been found in the amniote pallium.\nAs the teleost pallium itself receives sensory information of dif-\nferent modalities (e.g., auditory and visual inputs via the preg-\nlomerular complex), the inferior lobe seems to serve as another\nsensory integration center in the teleost brain (Fig.7).\nThe presence of multimodal inputs to the inferior lobe is likely\nto be a common feature in teleosts, but the particularity of the\nwrasse and cichlid brains is the inferior lobe’s intense connectivity\nFig. 5 Relatively larger Tel and rForeMid without a corresponding increase in the relative number of cells in wrasses compared to other teleosts.Three\nspecies of wrasses (« Wrasses »:Choerodon anchorago, Labroides dimidiatus, Thalassoma hardwicke) were compared with seven other teleost species from\nvarious orders (« Otherﬁsh »:Astyanax mexicanus, Amatitlania nigrofasciata, Danio rerio, Maylandia zebra, Neolamprologus brichardi, Ophtalmotilapia boops,\nSalmo trutta).

The major connectivity of the inferior lobe of\nother ﬁsh like trout,Astyanax surface ﬁsh, and zebraﬁsh is with\nthe pretectum, which is involved in stereotyped movements such\nas the optokinetic response61,62 or the prey detection J-turn in\nlarval zebraﬁsh63. Those types of movements are sufﬁcient for\nsimple foraging behaviors withoutﬂexibility. It is then possible\nthat the elaborated connectivity with the pallium present in\nwrasses and cichlids may have allowed for the emergence of their\nFig. 6 The pallio-lobar tracts are massively enlarged in the wrasse and cichlid, while they are absent in the trout, theAstyanax surface ﬁsh and the\nzebraﬁsh. 3D selective visualization of inferior lobeﬁber tracts comparing the wrasse (C. anchorago; a), the cichlid (N. brichardi; b), the trout (S. trutta; c),\nthe Astyanax surface ﬁsh (A. mexicanus; d), and the zebraﬁsh (D. rerio;e).

The large gustatory inputs of the\ninferior lobe may for instance be involved in different functions\nthan simply eating in these species.\nAs ﬁsh do not have hands, they use their mouth to manipulate\nobjects, and could likely haveﬁne discriminative touch and motor\ncontrol via the lips and oral cavity, functions which could involve\nthe inferior lobe. Apart from tool use in wrasses, cichlids display\nobject play and elaborate nest building behaviors64– 66, which also\nrequire this kind of precise motor control. Thus, one possibility is\nthat the inferior lobe plays a role in motor cortex-like functions.\nHodological data showing that the inferior lobe receives des-\ncending projections from the pallium (Supplementary Fig. 7) and\nprojects to the lateral valvular nucleus projecting to the\ncerebellum49,60 rather support the idea that the inferior lobe is\ninvolved in a motor aspect.\nAnother possibility is that the inferior lobe may also be a part\nof the higher-order areas, like the executive area (prefrontal\ncortex-like area). The presence of a higher-order association\ncenter in the teleost pallium has hardly been investigated so far.\nIn mammals and birds, the sensory association areas are located\nin the periphery of the primary sensory areas, and project to the\nexecutive area67– 72. If the teleost association areas are organized\nin the same manner, the area where the arborization of the\nventral pallio-lobar tract is located (Fig.6a, b; green) would be a\ngood candidate for the visual association area. The dorsal tele-\nncephalic area (Dl), the putative teleost primary visual area\n(Fig. 6a, b; orange pallial arborizations), projects to the sur-\nrounding pallial areas including the central part of the\npallium\n35,73, which in turn project to the IL. This projection\npattern is similar to the“primary sensory → sensory association\n→ executive“ pattern observed in amniotes.\nIn any case, the ability to use tools requires bothﬁne motor\nskills and executive functions (e.g., long working memory). These\nfunctions should reside in the pallium and/or inferior lobe of\nwrasses, unless this tool use by wrasses is a stereotyped behavior\nand not context dependent ﬂexibility, in which case a large\nexecutive area would not be required. Additional connectivity and\nfunctional studies are required to verify how higher-order areas\nare organized in the teleost brain.\nIn conclusion, our ﬁndings revealed that the encephalization\nprocess in teleosts is different from what has previously been\ndescribed in amniotes. While the pallium also appears to be\nimportant for higher-order cognitive functions in teleosts, the\nlarge pallio-lobar tracts in the tool-usingﬁshes demonstrate the\nfunctional importance of the inferior lobe in relation to the pal-\nlium, which may be critical for such complex behaviors. Since the\ninferior lobe has no homolog in amniotes, at least three different\nbrain organizations enabling higher-order cognitive functions\nmay have evolved independently in mammals, birds and teleosts.\nMethods\nStudy animals and brain sampling. 11 species of teleost were\nexamined: a group of 3 wrasse species (Choerodon anchorago,\nLabroides dimidiatus, Thalassoma hardwicke), for which complex\nbehaviors (tool use and social cognition) have been reported, 4\ncichlid species ( Maylandia zebra , Neolamprologus brichardi ,\nOphthalmotilapia boops, Amatitlania nigrofasciata), which are\ncapable to a lesser extent of complex behaviors, and a group of 4\nother species (the medaka ( Oryzias latipes), zebraﬁsh (Danio\nrerio), Astyanax surface ﬁsh (Astyanax mexicanus), and trout\n(Salmo trutta)).\nAdult individuals of zebraﬁsh (Danio rerio), medaka (Oryzia\nlatipes) and Astyanax mexicanus were obtained from the animal\nfacility in NeuroPSI (Saclay, France). Adult trouts (Salmo trutta)\nwere sourced from the animal facility at INRAE (Jouy-en-Josas,\nFrance). Neolamprologus brichardi, Amatitlania nigrofasciataand\nDanio rerio individuals used for tract-tracing with BDA and\nbiocytin were obtained from local dealers in Japan.\nSexually mature individuals of both sexes of wrasse and cichlid\nspecies were sourced from commercial providers ( Choerodon\nanchorago, Labroides dimidiatus, Thalassoma hardwicke: Marine\nLife (Paris, France); Maylandia zebra and Ophthalmotilapia\nboops: Abysses (Boissy-Saint-Léger, France); Amatitlania nigro-\nfasciata: Abysses, Aquarioﬁl.com (Nîmes, France),Neolamprolo-\ngus brichardi : Abysses, Aquario ﬁl.com). Wrasses were wild\ncaught and tended to be young adults, but one large adult of\nChoerodon anchoragoweighing around ten times as much as the\nFig. 7 Comparison of functional connectivity in relation to sensory inputs and motor outputs in amniotes and teleosts. aSimpliﬁed diagram showing\ninput/output connectivity of the pallium commonly found in mammals and birds (analogous, not necessarily homologous). Sensory inputs are shown in\nred, while motor outputs are shown in blue. The primary sensory areas in the pallium receive modal-speciﬁc sensory inputs from subtelencephalic sensory\nnuclei, mainly through the thalamus in the case of tetrapods. Note that there are two major visual pathways terminating in the pallium both in mammals\nand birds. The diagram is modiﬁed from Yamamoto and Bloch (2017)17. b Simpliﬁed diagram showing input/output connectivity of the pallium and inferior\nlobe (IL) in teleosts. The sensory afferents to the pallium in teleosts are mainly mediated via the preglomerular complex (PG) instead of the thalamus.I n\naddition to the pallium, the inferior lobe receives sensory inputs of different modalities, here showing only visual and gustatory, which are the dominant\nones. The pallium and the inferior lobe are highly connected in some teleost groups such as wrasses and cichlids.

Statistical analysis showed\nthat the data from this large individual did not impact the\nstatistical signiﬁcance of our results (see Supplementary File 1).\nZebraﬁsh and medaka specimens were anesthetized and\neuthanized in ice-cold water, weighed on a precision scale and\nﬁxed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.01 M\nphosphated buffer saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). All\nother ﬁsh specimens were euthanized by an overdose of MS222,\nweighed, and immediately perfused transcardially with 4% PFA in\nPBS. 24 h post-ﬁxation, brains were dissected, weighed on a\nprecision scale, and kept in 4% PFA in PBS for another 24 h\nbefore being transferred in anti-freeze solution (30% glycerol,\n30% ethylene glycol, 30% H20, 10% PBS 10X) and kept at−20 °C\nfor later use. Brains used for NeuroVue tract-tracing were kept in\n4% PFA at 4 °C until use.\nAll procedures were conducted in compliance with the ofﬁcial\nregulatory standards of the French Government and in\ncompliance with the ofﬁcial Japanese regulations for research\non animal, and the regulations on Animal Experiments in Nagoya\nUniversity.\nIsotropic fractionator. The medaka brains ( n = 5) were left\nundissected.\nThe brains ofn = 5 individuals of each species, except the trout\n(n = 4), M. zebra (n = 3), C. anchorago (n = 4), L. dimidiatus\n(n = 3), T. hardwicke(n = 3) andO. boops(n = 3) were rinsed in\nPBS and embedded in 3% agarose containing 1% Tween 20 and\nsectioned at 300 µm in the frontal plane with a vibratome (Leica\nVT 1200 S). Under a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX7), the\nbrain was manually dissected using a microsurgical knife intoﬁve\nregions following the rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral axis\n(Fig. 4).\nThe dorsal part of the secondary prosencephalon, which\nincludes the telencephalon and the dorso-rostral part of the optic\nrecess region (ORR)17,18, was excised. This region was labeled\n“telencephalon” (Tel). The second region dissected was the dorsal\npart of the mesencephalon, which includes the tectum opticum\nand the torus semicircularis and was labeled “optic tectum”\n(TeO). The third region included the ventral part of the\nsecondary prosencephalon (i.e., the hypothalamus), the dience-\nphalon and the ventral part of the mesencephalon (i.e., the\ntegmentum and the inferior lobe) and was labeled“rest of the\nforebrain/midbrain” (rForeMid). The fourth excised region was\nthe dorsal part of the rhombencephalon (i.e., the cerebellum)\n(Cb). Finally, all the other hindbrain structures, including the\nmedulla oblongata, were labeled“rest of the hindbrain” (rHind).\nSections were dried with a paper towel, weighed on a precision\nscale and kept in 4% PFA for later use.\nThe number of cells in theﬁve main regions of the teleost brain\nwas determined using the isotropic fractionator method34. This\nmethod produces results similar to unbiased stereology74. Each\nstructure was manually homogenized in 40 mM sodium citrate\nwith 1% Triton X-100 using a Tenbroeck tissue grinder (Ningbo\nJa-Hely Technology Co., Ningbo, China). Once an isotropic\nsuspension of isolated cell nuclei was obtained, the suspension\nwas then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The cell\nnuclei in both the suspension pellet and the supernatant were\nstained by adding PBS with 1% diamino-phenyl-indol (DAPI).\nAdditionally, a predetermined volume of PBS was added to the\nsuspension to adjust the nuclei density for counting.\nTo determine the total number of cells in the tissue, four 10 µL\naliquots of the suspension and of the supernatant were counted\nunder an epiﬂuorescence microscope (Axio Imager, Zeiss) with\nX200 magni ﬁcation using a Blaubrand Malassez counting\nchamber (Brand Gmbh, Wertheim, Germany). Mean nuclear\ndensity in the suspension and the supernatant was multiplied by\ntheir total volume and added up to determine the total number of\ncells in the brain tissue.\nTo determine the total number of neurons in each sample, we\ninitially aimed at performing an anti-NeuN immunoreaction in\nPBS using anti-NeuN antibodies. However, after testing multiple\nantibodies (anti-NeuN rabbit Antibody, ABN78 & ABN78C3,\nMerck; anti-NeuN rabbit Antibody, ab177487, Abcam; anti-\nNeuN mouse Antibody, MAB377, Merck) and increasing anti-\nbody concentrations (up to 1:50), we were unable to obtain\nreliable neuronal nuclear staining. Further tests on brain sections\nalso failed to label teleost neuronal nuclei with NeuN in a\nconsistent manner, suggesting that this tool was not appropriate\nfor teleost tissues. Consequently, we decided to present data on\ntotal cell numbers for our brain samples.\nWhole-brain clearing and ﬁber staining. Lipophilic dye was\napplied to n = 2 whole brains ofD. rerio, A. mexicanus, N. bri-\nchardi, C. anchorago and S. trutta for ﬁber bundles tracing.\nBrains stored in anti-freeze solution at−20 °C were washed\nwith PBST for at least 1 day. Samples were bleached for 2 h under\nintense lighting (>10,000 lux, GVL-SPOT-50-FIXV4-230VAC,\nGreenVisuaLED) in a fresh depigmentation solution of 5% H2O2,\n0.05% sodium azide in PBS. The bleached samples were\nthoroughly washed with PBST overnight and were then subjected\nto a size-dependent delipidation step in CUBIC-L75.T h e yw e r e\nﬁrst immersed in a mixture of 50% PBST/50% CUBIC-L overnight\nunder gentle shaking followed by an incubation in CUBIC-L at\n37 °C under agitation for 1– 2 days for D. rerio, 3 days for A.\nmexicanus, 4 days forN. brichardi and 6 days forC. anchorago\nand S. trutta with solution renewed once. Delipidated specimens\nwere washed with PBST for at least 4 h prior to staining.\nStaining was performed in solutions that were originally\ndesigned for immunostaining of zebraﬁsh larvae76. Samples were\nimmersed in a blocking solution of 10% normal goat serum, 10%\nDMSO, 5% 1 M PBS-glycine, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium\ndeoxycholate, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 and 0.1% saponin in PBST\novernight at 37 °C under gentle shaking. Subsequently, specimens\nwere stained with 2 µg/ml of DiI (D282) in a solution of 2% NGS,\n20% DMSO, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.2% Triton-X100, 10 µg/mL\nheparin and 0.1% saponin at 37 °C under rotation for a specimen-\ndependent duration.\nAfter a last washing step in PBST, refractive index matching\nwas carried out in weakly basic CUBIC-R solution75. Brains were\nsoaked in a mixture of 50% PBST/50% CUBIC-R overnight under\nagitation and then kept in CUBIC-R (refractive index = 1.52)\nprior to mounting.\nWhole-brain 3D imaging. Refractive index matched samples\nwere embedded in a ﬁltered (pore size 5.0 µm) melted agarose\nsolution containing 2% agarose, 70% CUBIC-R in distilled H2O.\nCUBIC/agarose gels were immersed in CUBIC-R at room tem-\nperature for a minimum of 1 day to homogenize refractive indices.\nImages were acquired with two commercial light-sheet\nﬂuorescence microscopes. Acquisitions were performed with an\nUltramicroscope II (Miltenyi Biotec) using a 1.1x NA 0.1 MI\nPLAN objective and a DC57 WD17 0 dipping cap coupled to a 2x\nmagniﬁcation lens, or a LVMI-Fluor 4x/0.3 WD6 objective\nwithout additional magniﬁcation. A Lightsheet 7 (Zeiss) equipped\nwith 10 × 0.2 foc illumination and 5 × 0.16 foc detection optics\nwas also used. According to their size and the type of microscope\nimages were acquired from dorsal or sagittal view. Cotton seed oil\nwas poured on the surface of the imaging medium as an\nimpermeable layer to avoid evaporation-induced refractive index\nchanges during imaging. 16-bit images were acquired by a\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05663-8 ARTICLE\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|            (2024) 7:88 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05663-8 | www.nature.com/commsbio 11\npco.edge 5.5 sCMOS camera (2560 × 2160 pixels, pixel size\n6.5 µm × 6.5 µm) on the Ultramicroscope II or a pco.edge\n4.2 sCMOS camera (1920 × 1920 pixels, pixel size\n6.5 µm × 6.5 µm) on the Lightsheet 7, following sample excitation\nwith laser 488 and 561 nm. The z-step size wasﬁxed to 6 µm on\nthe Ultramicroscope II and 5.176 µm on the Lightsheet 7, which\nrepresents nearly half of the theoretical lightsheet thickness.\n3D image reconstruction and manual segmentation. For the\ninter-species comparison of the anatomy of the tracts connecting\nthe Tel with the rForeMid, these structures were segmented\nmanually using the 3D visualization and reconstruction software\nAmira 2019 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).\nThe combination of the overall size of the specimens and the\nrequired resolution/voxel size demanded tiled image acquisition.\nThe resulting image stacks were merged using the Grid/Collection\nstitching plugin\n77 in Fiji.\nIn preparation for the manual segmentation, the signal-to-\nnoise ratio of the merged data was improved by subtracting the\ngaussian noise (Fiji, Gaussian Blur 3D, Kernel 10,10,10) from the\noriginal data. After manual segmentation of the original data and\nthe denoised data by an unbiased researcher, the deﬁned regions\nwere reﬁned by multiplying the denoised data with the individual\nbinary masks of the segmentations.\nThe 3D reconstructions in Fig. 6 were produced on n = 2\nbrains for each species by selective visualization of the denoised\nfeatures under investigation in this study within the framework of\nthe overall anatomy of the corresponding brains.\nTract-tracing with NeuroVue. In order to conﬁrm the presence\nof the inferior lobeﬁber tracts visualized with DiI staining, tract-\ntracing experiments were performed using NeuroVue (Poly-\nsciences), a lipophilic dye which allows both retrograde and\nanterograde tracing and can be used onﬁxed brain tissue\n78. Small\ntriangular pieces of NeuroVueﬁlter paper were inserted into the\ninferior lobe ofn = 3 specimens ofA. mexicanus, N. brichardiand\nC. anchorago, and into the pallium of n = 3 specimens of N.\nbrichardi. Brains were then incubated at 36 °C in 4% PFA in PBS\nfor 4 (A. mexicanus) to 12 days (C. anchorago).\nFollowing incubation, 80 µm sections were cut with a\nvibratome (Leica VT1200S), both in frontal and sagittal planes\nin order to visualize theﬁber tracts’ orientation in 3D. Sections\nwere then treated with DAPI before being mounted on glass slides\nwith VectaShield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).\nSections were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.\nTract-tracing with BDA and biocytin. BDA (molecular weight\n3000) or biocytin was injected in vivo into the pallium of two\nspecies of cichlids of both sexes, N. brichardi (n = 5; standard\nlength: 30 – 49 mm), A. nigrofasciata (n = 5; standard length:\n45– 55 mm) and zebraﬁsh D. rerio(n = 2; standard length: 30 and\n35 mm). Fish were anesthetized by immersion in water contain-\ning 150 – 180 mg/L MS222 and set in a device for physical\nrestraint. Water containing 70 – 80 mg/L MS222 was perfused\nthrough the gill for aeration and to maintain the anesthetic\ncondition. A dorsal portion of the cranium was opened to expose\nthe brain. For BDA injections, a glass microelectrode (tip dia-\nmeters: 12– 16 µm)ﬁlled with 0.75% BDA solution in 0.05 M Tris-\nHCl-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.4) was driven into the pallium\nwith a manipulator (MN-3; Narishige). BDA was injected ion-\ntophoretically with square current pulses (+5 µA, 0.5 Hz, 50%\nduty cycle) passed through the electrodes at three to six places of\nthe pallium each for 5 min with a stimulator (SEN-3301; Nihon\nKohden, Japan). For biocytin injections, crystals of biocytin were\ninserted with a minute insect pin into three to six places of the\npallium. After the injection, the cranial opening was closed with\neither plastic wrap (smallﬁsh) or dental cement (Ostron II; GC\nDental Products, Japan). Postoperative ﬁsh were maintained in\naquaria for 21– 30 h. Theﬁsh were then deeply anesthetized with\nMS222 (over 200 mg/L) and perfused through the heart with 2%\nPFA and 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH\n7.4. The brains were removed from the skull and post-ﬁxed in the\nsame ﬁxative at 4 °C for 6– 8h .\nThe ﬁxed brains were cryo-protected by immersion in 0.1 M\nPB containing 20% sucrose at 4 °C. Cryo-protected brains were\nembedded in 5% agarose (type IX, ultra-low gelling temperature)\ncontaining 20% sucrose and frozen in n-hexane at−60 °C. Then,\nfrontal sections were cut at a thickness of 40 µm on a cryostat and\nmounted on gelatin-coated glass slides. The sections were dried\nand washed once with 0.05 M TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20\n(TBST) and twice with TBS. To quench non-speciﬁc peroxidase\nactivities, sections were steeped in methanol containing 0.3%\nH2O2 and washed three times with TBS and once with 0.03%\nTBST. Sections were then incubated with a solution of avidin-\nbiotin-peroxidase complex (1:100; VECTASTAIN Elite ABC\nStandard Kit, Vector Laboratories) overnight. Afterwards,\nsections were incubated for one hour with 0.05% 3,3’-diamino-\nbenzidine solution in 0.1 M PB containing 0.04% nickel\nammonium sulfate and 0.01% H2O2. The reaction was stopped\nby washing four times with TBS, and the sections were\ncounterstained with 0.05 – 0.1% cresyl violet, dehydrated, and\ncoverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientiﬁc).\nStatistics and reproducibility. To determine whether brain mass,\nbody mass, and total number of cells in the brain are correlated in\nteleosts, a nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test was\nused on log-transformed data. Previously published data on\nbirds\n8 and mammals38 were used for comparison. If aP < 0.05\nvalue was found, reduced major axis (RMA) regressions were\ncalculated using the SMATR package79 in RStudio v.1.2.5033 and\nﬁtted RMA regression lines were added to the plots (Fig.2). To\ncompare scaling among taxonomic groups, an analysis of covar-\niance (ANCOVA) with post-hoc Sidak corrected pairwise com-\nparisons was used to check for signiﬁcant differences in the slopes\nof the regression lines. In groups for which the slopes were sta-\ntistically homogeneous, the regression lines were compared based\non the differences in their intercepts. Body mass and Brain mass,\nTotal number of cells in the brain and Brain mass, and Body mass\nand Total number of cells in the brain were signiﬁcantly corre-\nlated in all groups (Spearman r ranging from 0.945 to 1;\np < 0.0001 in all cases). Data on Columbiformes and Galliformes8\nwas plotted as illustration but wasn’t included in the statistical\nanalysis due to the small sample size.\nRegression lines for Body mass and Brain mass (Fig.2a) had\nsigniﬁcantly different slopes (ANCOVA, p < 0.0001). Pairwise\ncomparisons found signiﬁcant differences in the slopes of Glires\nand Primates (p < 0.001), Primates and Psittacopasserae (p =0.0001)\nand Primates and Teleosts ( p < 0.0001).

Pairwise comparisons found signiﬁcant differ-\nences in the intercepts of Glires, Teleosts and Psittacopasserae\n(p < 0.05 in all cases). Regression lines for Total number of cells in\nthe brain and Brain mass (Fig.2c) had signiﬁcantly different slopes\n(ANCOVA, p < 0.0001). Pairwise comparisons found signiﬁcant\ndifferences in the slopes of Glires and Primates (p < 0.01) and\nPrimates and Psittacopasserae ( p < 0.01). ANCOVA revealed\nsigniﬁcant differences in the intercepts of the regression lines\n(p < 0.0001). Pairwise comparisons found signiﬁcant differences in\nthe intercepts of the regression lines for Glires, Teleosts, Primates\nand Psittacopasserae (p < 0.0001 in all cases), with the exception of\nthe intercepts of Glires and Primates ( p =0.08). In order to\ndetermine the degree of encephalization of the teleost species\nsampled in this study, a phylogenetically corrected brain-body\nallometric slope was estimated using PGLS at the Class level on\nspecies means of log10 brain and log10 body mass data of the species\nsampled in this study along with previously published actynopter-\nygian data by Tsuboi et al.5 using RStudio v.1.2.5033 with the\nCAPER package v.1.0.1 (Fig.3). Residual variance was modeled\naccording to Brownian motion80 and phylogenetic signal was\nestimated using Pagel’s λ81. Phylogenetic relationships between\nteleost species were based on previously published phylogenetic\ntrees82. The phylogenetic regression slope for actinopterygians was\nof 0.50 ± 0.01 (Adjusted R2: 0.8382, t =65.978, p < 0.0001).\nEncephalization was then determined by extracting the residuals\nof log10-log10 brain and body mass for each species of the dataset to\nremove allometry in brain size83. The 11 species studied were ranked\nbased on the value of their residual (Supplementary Table 1).\nTo determine whether there exists a correlation between the\ndegree of encephalization and relative mass and relative number of\ncells (expressed as the percentageof total brain mass and percentage\nof total brain cells, respectively) of theﬁve major brain structures\ndissected, a nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test was used,\nas there was no way to ascertain the normal distribution of these\ndata. We arranged species by decreasing order of encephalization\n(Supplementary Fig. 4). The test was performed in GraphPad Prism\nv.9.0.0 (GraphPad Software) on species means. A signiﬁcant negative\ncorrelation was found between encephalization and the relative mass\nand relative number of cells in the rHind (Supplementary Fig. 4e,\nSpearman r: −0.7091, p =0.0268 and Spearman r: −0.6727,\np =0.039, respectively). No signiﬁcant correlation with encephaliza-\ntion was found in the four other brain structures for either relative\nmass or relative number of cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a– d, Tel\nrelative mass: Spearman r: 0.4788,p =0.1663; relative number of\ncells: Spearman r: 0.01818,p =0.973; TeO relative mass: Spearman\nr: −0.1394, p =0.7072; relative number of cells: Spearman r: 0.1394,\np =0.7072; rForeMid relative mass: Spearman r: 0.3333,p =0.3487;\nrelative number of cells: Spearman r: −0.4788, p =0.1663; Cb\nrelative mass: Spearman r:−0.1273, p =0.7330; relative number of\nc e l l s :S p e a r m a nr :0 . 4 5 4 5 ,p =0.1912).\nIn order to compare species to species the relative mass,\nabsolute and relative number of cells in major brain structures,\nnormality of the data was tested using Shapiro-Wilk’s test. As\nnormality was not veri ﬁed for all the species studied, and\nconsidering the small sample size, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis\nand Dunn’s post hoc tests were used to assess the inter-species\ndifferences in relative mass, absolute and relative number of cells\nin theﬁve dissected brain structures. All tests were performed in\nGraphPad Prism v. 9.0.0. Signiﬁcant differences were found in the\nabsolute number of cells in all ﬁve structures (Kruskal-Wallis,\np < 0.001 in all cases). However, post-hoc pairwise comparisons\nrevealed signi ﬁcant differences that were inconsistent across\nspecies and brain structures, the only consistently found\ndifference across all structures being between D. rerio and C.\nanchorago (Dunn’s test, p < 0.05 in all cases). Signi ﬁcant\ndifferences were found in the relative number of cells in allﬁve\nstructures (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.05 in all cases). However, post-\nhoc pairwise comparisons revealed signiﬁcant differences that\nwere inconsistent across species and brain structures. Signiﬁcant\ndifferences were found in the relative mass in allﬁve structures\n(Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.05 in all cases). However, post-hoc pairwise\ncomparisons didn’t reveal signiﬁcant differences between species\nacross the ﬁve structures, except for a modest difference in the\nrelative mass of the rHind betweenA. mexicanus, C. anchorago\nand T. hardwicke (Dunn’s test, p = 0.0307 and p = 0.0317,\nrespectively), and in the relative mass of the Tel between C.\nanchorago and S. trutta (Dunn’s test, p = 0.0254).\nAmong the teleost species studied, wrasses display the most\ncomplex behavioral phenotypes. To determine whether this\nbehavioral repertoire is associated with differences in relative mass\nand relative number of cells in theﬁve major brain structures\ncompared to other teleosts, the three species of wrasse ( C.\nanchorago (n =4), T. hardwicke (n =3) and L. dimidiatus\n(n =3)) were grouped together (n =10) and compared to all the\nother species (M. zebra (n =3), N. brichardi (n =5), O. boops\n(n =3), A. nigrofasciata (n =5), A. mexicanus (n =5), D. rerio\n(n =5) and S. trutta (n =4), grouped as “other ﬁsh” (n =30))\n(Fig. 5). Regarding the relative mass, wrasses had a signiﬁcantly\nlarger Tel (Fig. 5a) and rForeMid (Fig. 5c) compared to other\nteleosts (Mann-Whitney’s test, p <0 . 0 0 0 1 a n dp =0.0031, respec-\ntively), and a signiﬁcantly smaller Cb (Fig.5d) and rHind (Fig.5e)\n(p =0.0011 andp < 0.0001, respectively). No signiﬁcant differences\nwere found in the relative mass of the TeO (Fig.5b, p =0.5483).\nRegarding the relative number of cells, Wrasses had a signiﬁcantly\nlower relative number of cells in the rHind (Fig.5j) compared to\nthe other teleosts (Mann-Whitney’s test,p <0 . 0 0 0 1 ) .N os i g n iﬁcant\ndifferences were found in the relative number of cells of the other\nfour structures (Fig. 5f– i, Tel: p =0.0538; TeO: p =0.3626;\nrForeMid: p =0.1983; Cb: p =0.8658). Normality and Mann-\nWhitney tests were performed in GraphPad Prism v. 9.0.0.\nAnother analysis was done in order to assess the differences in\nrelative mass and relative number of cells in the brain structures:\nas cichlids appeared to have a large rForeMid, we decided to\ncompare them to wrasses and to the other species of teleosts\nstudied here (Supplementary Fig. 6). A. mexicanus (n = 5), D.\nrerio (n = 5) and S. trutta (n = 4), were grouped together as an\n“outgroup” (n = 14). In both cases, as normality could not be\nsatisﬁed for all structures in all groups, a nonparametric Kruskal-\nWallis test was used. All tests were performed in GraphPad Prism\nv. 9.0.0. Regarding the relative mass, wrasses and cichlids had a\nsigniﬁcantly larger Tel (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and rForeMid\n(Supplementary Fig. 6c) compared to the“outgroup” (Kruskal-\nWallis test,p < 0.01 in both structures), and a signiﬁcantly smaller\nTeO (Supplementary Fig. 6b) (p < 0.05 in all cases). Additionally,\nwrasses had a larger Tel compared to cichlids (Supplementary\nFig. 6a) (p = 0.0324). Regarding the relative number of cells,\nwrasses had a signiﬁcantly lower relative number of cells in the\nrHind (Supplementary Fig. 6j) while cichlids had a signiﬁcantly\nhigher relative number of cells in the rForeMid (Supplementary\nFig. 6h) compared to the “outgroup” (Kruskal-Wallis test,\np < 0.0001 and p = 0.0137, respectively). No signiﬁcant differ-\nences were found in the relative number of cells in the rForeMid\nbetween wrasses and cichlids (p = 0.0506).\nReporting summary.
