Binaries for the most common operating systems are available at\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/snepnetrends/.\nK\neywords: effective population size, linkage disequilibrium, SNPChip, demography, large scale genotyping\nIntroduction\nEﬀective population size (N e) is an important genetic parameter that estimates the amount of\ngenetic drift in a population, and has been described as the size of an idealized Wright–Fisher pop-\nulation expected to yield the same value of a given genetic parameter as in the population under\nstudy ( Crow and Kimura, 1970). Ne s\nizes can be inﬂuenced by ﬂuctuations in census population\nsize (Nc), by the breeding sex ratio and the variance in reproductive success.\nNe estimation can be achieved using approaches that fall into three methodological categories:\ndemographic, pedigree-based, or marker-based ( Flury et al., 2010). Pedigree data have been tra-\nd\nitionally used to obtain Ne estimates in livestock. However, reliable estimates of Ne depend on\nthe pedigree being complete. This state of knowledge is feasible in some domestic populations,\nthe demographic parameters of which have been accurately monitored for a suﬃciently large\nnumber of generations. However, in practice, the applicability of this approach remains limited\nto a few cases involving highly managed breeds (Flury et al., 2010; Uimari and Tapio, 2011).\nBarbato et al. SNeP: a tool to estimate Ne\nOne solution to overcome the limitation of an incomplete\npedigree is to estimate the recent trend in Ne using genomic data.\nSeveral authors have recognized that Ne could be estimated from\ninformation on linkage disequilibrium (LD) ( Sved, 1971; Hill,\n1981). LD describes the non-random association of alleles in dif -\nferent loci as a function of the recombination rate between t he\nphysical positions of the loci in the genome. However, LD signa -\ntures can also result from demographic processes such as admix -\nture and genetic drift ( Wright, 1943; Wang, 2005 ), or through\nprocesses such as “hitchhiking” during selective sweeps ( Smith\nand Haigh, 1974 ) or background selection ( Charlesworth et al.,\n1997). In such scenarios alleles at diﬀerent loci become associ-\nated independently of their proximity in the genome. Assuming\nthat a population is closed and panmictic, the LD value calculat ed\nbetween neutral unlinked loci depends exclusively on genetic\ndrift (\nSved, 1971; Hill, 1981 ). This occurrence can be used to pre-\ndict Ne due to the known relationship between the variance in LD\n(calculated using allele frequencies) and eﬀective population size\n(Hill, 1981).\nRecent advances in genotyping technology (e.g., using SNP\nbead arrays with tens of thousands of DNA probes) have enabled\nthe collection of vast amounts of genome-wide linkage data i deal\nfor estimating Ne in livestock and humans among others (e.g.,\nTenesa et al., 2007; de Roos et al., 2008; Corbin et al., 2010; Ui mari\nand Tapio, 2011; Kijas et al., 2012 ). However, a software tool that\nenables estimation of Ne from LD is lacking, and researchers cur-\nrently rely on a combination of tools to manipulate data, infe r\nLD, and tend to use bespoke scripts to perform the appropriate\ncalculations and estimate Ne.\nHere we describe SNeP, a software tool that allows the estima-\ntion of Ne trends across generation using SNP data that corrects\nfor sample size, phasing and recombination rate.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe method SNeP uses to calculate LD depends on the availabil-\nity of phased data. When the phase is known the user can select\nHill and Robertson (1968) squared correlation coeﬃcient that\nmakes use of haplotype frequencies to deﬁne LD between each\npair of loci (Equation 1). However, in the absence of a known\nphase, squared Pearson’s product-moment correlation coeﬃci ent\nbetween pairs of loci can be selected. While these two approache s\nare not the same, they are highly comparable (\nMcEvoy et al.,\n2011):\nr2 =\n(\npAB−pApB\n) 2\npA\n(\n1 − pA\n)\npB\n(\n1 − pB\n) (1)\nr2\nX, Y =\n[ ∑ n\ni = 1\n(\nXi −\nX\n) (\nYi − Y\n)] 2\n∑ n\ni = 1\n(\nXi −\nX\n) 2 ∑ n\ni = 1\n(\nYi −\nY\n) 2 (2)\nwhere pA and pB are respectively the frequencies of alleles A and\nB at two separate loci ( X, Y) measured for n individuals, pAB is the\nfrequency of the haplotype with alleles A and B in the population\nstudied,\nX and Y are the mean genotype frequencies for the ﬁrst\nand second locus respectively, Xi is the genotype of individual i at\nthe ﬁrst locus and Yi is the genotype of individual i at the second\nlocus. Equation (2) correlates the genotypic allele counts i nstead\nof the haplotype frequencies and is not inﬂuenced by double het-\nerozygotes (this approach results in the same estimates as the --r2\noption in PLINK).\nSNeP estimates the historic eﬀective population size based\non the relationship between r2, Ne, and c (recombination rate),\n(Equation 3—\nSved, 1971 ), and enabling users to include cor-\nrections for sample size and uncertainty of the gametic phase\n(Equation 4—\nWeir and Hill, 1980 ):\nE\n(\nr2)\n= ( 1 + 4Nec) −1 (3)\nr2\nadj = r2 − ( β n) −1 (4)\nwhere n is the number of individual sampled, β = 2 when the\ngametic phase is known and β = 1 if instead the phase is not\nknown.\nSeveral approximations are used to infer the recombination\nrate using the physical distance ( δ ) between two loci as a refer-\nence and translating it into linkage distance ( d), which is usually\ndescribed as Mb(δ ) ≈ cM(d). For small values of d the latter\napproximation is valid, but for larger values of d the probability of\nmultiple recombination events and interference increases, more-\nover the relationship between map distance and recombinatio n\nrate is not linear, as the maximum recombination rate possibl e\nis 0.5. Thus, unless using very short δ , the approximation d ≈\nc is not ideal ( Corbin et al., 2012 ). We therefore implemented\nmapping functions to translate the estimated d into c, follow-\ning Haldane (1919), Kosambi (1943) , Sved (1971), and Sved and\nFeldman (1973) . Initially SNeP infers d for each pair of SNPs\nas directly proportional to δ according to d = kδ where k is a\nuser deﬁned recombination rate value (default value is 10 −8 as in\nMb = cM). The inferred value of δ can then be subjected to one\nof the available mapping functions if required by the user.\nSolving Equation (3) for Ne and including all the correc-\ntions described, allows the prediction of Ne from LD data using\n(Corbin et al., 2012 ):\nNT( t) =\n(\n4f ( ct)\n) −1\n(\nE\n[\nr2\nadj|ct\n] −1\n− α\n)\n(5)\nwhere Nt is the eﬀective population size t generations ago\ncalculated as t = (2f (ct))−1 (Hayes et al., 2003 ), ct is the\nrecombination rate deﬁned for a speciﬁc physical distance\nbetween markers and optionally adjusted with the mapping func-\ntions mentioned above, r2\nadj is the LD value adjusted for sam-\nple size and α := {1, 2, 2.2} is a correction for the occurrence of\nmutations (\nOhta and Kimura, 1971 ). Therefore, LD over greater\nrecombinant distances is informative on recent Ne while shorter\ndistances provide information on more distant times in the past .\nA binning system is implemented in order to obtain averaged r2\nvalues that reﬂect LD for speciﬁc inter-locus distances. The b in-\nning system implemented uses the following formula to deﬁne\nthe minimum and maximum values for each bin:\nbmin\ni = minD + ( maxD − minD)\n( bi − 1\ntotBins\n) x\n(6a)\nbmax\ni = minD + ( maxD − minD)\n( bi\ntotBins\n) x\n(6b)\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 109\nBarbato et al. SNeP: a tool to estimate Ne\nWhere bi (N1) is the ith bin of the total number of bins ( totBins),\nminD, and maxD are respectively the minimum and the maxi-\nmum distance between SNPs and x is a positive real number ( R0)\nWhen x equals 1, the distribution of distances between the bins is\nlinear and each bin has the same distance range. For larger va lues\nof x the distribution of distances changes allowing a larger ran ge\non the last bins and a smaller range on the ﬁrst bins. Varying t his\nparameter allows the user to have a suﬃcient number of pairwise\ncomparisons to contribute to the ﬁnal Ne estimate for each bin.\nExample Application\nWe tested SNeP with two published datasets that had been\npreviously used to describe trends in Ne over time using LD,\nBos indicus [54,436 SNPs of 423 East African Shorthorn Zebu\n(SHZ)–\nMbole-Kariuki et al., 2014 , data available at Dryad Dig-\nital Repository: doi:10.5061/dryad.bc598.] and Ovis aries[49,034\nSNPs genotyped in 24 Swiss White Alpine (SWA), 24 Swiss Black-\nBrown Mountain sheep (SBS), 24 Valais Blacknose sheep (VBS),\n23 Valais Red sheep (VRS), 24 Swiss Mirror sheep (SMS) and\n24 Bundner Oberländer sheep (BOS)–\nBurren et al., 2014 ]. The\nr2 estimates for the cattle datasets were obtained by the autho rs\nusing GenABLE ( Aulchenko et al., 2007 ) using a minimum allele\nfrequency (MAF) < 0.01 and adjusting the recombination rate\nusing Haldane’s mapping function ( Haldane, 1919 ). The r2 esti-\nmates of the sheep data were calculated by the authors using\nPLINK-1.07 (\nPurcell et al., 2007 ), with a MAF < 0.05 and no fur-\nther corrections. For both autosomal datasets r2 estimates where\ncorrected for sample size using equation (4) with β = 2. For these\ncomparative analyses the SNeP command line included the same\nparameters used for the published data apart from the r2 esti-\nmates, calculated through genotype count and the use of SNeP’s\nnovel binning strategy.\nResults\nSNeP is a multithreaded application developed in C ++ and\nbinaries for the most common operating systems (Windows,\nOSX, and Linux) can be downloaded from\nhttps://source\nforge.net/projects/snepnetrends/. The binaries are accompanied\nby a manual describing the step-by-step use of SNeP to infer\ntrends in Ne as described here. SNeP produces an output ﬁle with\ntab delimited columns showing the following for each bin that\nwas used to estimate Ne: the number of generations in the past\nthat the bin corresponds to (e.g., 50 generations ago), the co rre-\nsponding Ne estimate, the average distance between each pair of\nSNPs in the bin, the average r2 and the standard deviation of r2 in\nthe bin, and the number of SNPs used to calculate r2 in the bin.\nThis ﬁle can be easily imported in Microsoft Excel, R or other\nsoftware to plot the results. The plots shown here (\nFigures 1, 3)\ncorrespond to the columns of generations ago and Ne from the\noutput ﬁle. The column with the r2 standard deviation is pro-\nvided for users to inspect the variance in the Ne estimate in each\nbin, particularly for those bins reﬂecting older time estima tes and\nwhich are less reliable as the number of SNPs used to estimate r2\nbecomes smaller.\nThe format required for the input ﬁles is the standard PLINK\nformat (ped and map ﬁles) ( Purcell et al., 2007 ). SNeP allows\nthe users to either calculate LD on the data as described abov e,\nor use a custom precalculated LD matrix to estimate Ne using\nEquation (5).\nThe software interface allows the user to control all param-\neters of the analysis, e.g., the distance range between SNPs in\nbp, and the set of chromosomes used in the analysis (e.g., 20–\n23). Additionally, SNeP includes the option to choose a MAF\nthreshold (default 0.05), as it has been shown that accounti ng for\nMAF results in unbiased r2 estimates irrespective of sample size\nFIGURE 1 | Comparison ofNe trends of six Swiss sheep breeds according toBurren et al. (2014)(dashed lines) and this work (solid lines).\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 109\nBarbato et al. SNeP: a tool to estimate Ne\n(Sved et al., 2008 ). SNeP’s multithreaded architecture allows fast\ncomputation of large datasets (we tested up to ∼100K SNPs for\na single chromosome), for example the BOS data described here\nwas analyzed with one processor in 2 ′43′′, the use of two pro-\ncessors reduced the time to 1 ′43′′, four processors reduced the\nanalysis time to 1 ′05′′.\nZebu Example\nFor the zebu analysis, the shapes of the Ne curves obtained with\nSNeP and their published data trends showed the same trajec-\ntory with a smooth decline until around 150 generations ago,\nfollowed by an expansion with a peak around 40 generations ago\nand ending in a steep decline on the most recent generations\n(\nFigure 1). However, while the trends in both curves were the\nsame, the two approaches resulted in diﬀerent Ne estimates, with\nSNeP’s values being approximately three-fold larger than those\nin the original paper. While we attempted to use the authors’\nparameters in our analyses, some diﬀerences were inevitable, i.e.,\nthe original publication of the cattle data estimated r2 with a\ndiﬀerent approach to that implemented in SNeP. Analyses with\nSNeP were based on genotypes, while the original analysis was\nbased on inferred two locus haplotypes, which results in the\npublished data showing an expected r2 of 0.32 at the minimum\ndistance, while our estimates was 0.23. Similarly,\nMbole-Kariuki\net al. (2014) obtained a background level r2 = 0.013 around 2\nMb, while our estimate at the same distance was 0.0035 (data no t\nshown). Consequently, as our estimates of LD were consisten tly\nsmaller than Mbole-Kariuki et al. (2014) it is expected that our\nNe estimates should be larger. While this observation highlig hts\nthe importance of a careful choice of the parameters and their\nthresholds, it is important to highlight that although the ab so-\nlute magnitude of the Ne values is diﬀerent, the trends are almost\nidentical.\nSwiss Sheep Example\nThe six Swiss sheep breeds analyzed with SNeP produced compa-\nrable results with those from the original paper (\nFigure 2), with\nmostly overlapping Ne trend curves ( Figure 3). However, the\ngeneral trend in Ne showed a decline toward the present. SNeP\nproduced slightly larger values of Ne for the more distant past\n(700–800 generations). This is due to the diﬀerent binning sy stem\nFIGURE 2 | Comparison between recentNe values calculated at the\n29th generation in this work andBurren et al. (2014)for six Swiss\nsheep breeds.\nused in SNeP, which allows the user to obtain a more even distri-\nbution of pairwise comparisons within each bin (i.e., the numb er\nof SNP pairwise comparisons within each bin is comparable). For\nthe time span extending beyond 400 generations ago,\nBurren et al.\n(2014) used only three bins in their analysis (centered at 400, 667,\nand 2000 generations ago) while for the same time span SNeP\nused 5 bins with a number of pairwise comparisons dependent to\nthe range deﬁned with formulae 6a,b. Consequently, Burren a nd\ncolleagues’ approach ends with a higher density of data describ -\ning the most recent generations than describing the oldest g en-\nerations. Therefore, the use of fewer bins tends to increase the\npresence of smaller values of Ne in each bin, consequently lower-\ning the average Ne value for each bin. The Ne values for the recent\npast, compared at the 29th generation in the past, gave very sim-\nilar results. The largest diﬀerence (50) was obtained for the S BS\nbreed.\nDiscussion\nAnalysis of Ne using LD data was ﬁrst demonstrated 40 years ago,\nand has been applied, developed and improved since (\nSved, 1971;\nHayes et al., 2003; Tenesa et al., 2007; de Roos et al., 2008; Co rbin\net al., 2012; Sved et al., 2013 ). The traditionally small number of\nSNPs analyzed is no longer a limitation, since SNP Chips com-\nprise an extremely large number of SNPs, available in a short\ntime and at a reasonable price. This has boosted the use of the\nmethod, which has been applied to humans (\nTenesa et al., 2007;\nMcEvoy et al., 2011 ) as well as to several domesticated species\n(England et al., 2006; Uimari and Tapio, 2011; Corbin et al., 201 2;\nKijas et al., 2012 ). Along with these improvements, methodolog-\nical limitations have become apparent and have been addressed\nhere, with the majority of the eﬀorts pointing to the correct es ti-\nmation of recent Ne. Yet, the quantitative value of the estimate\nis highly dependent on sample size, the type of LD estimation\nand the binning process (\nWaples and Do, 2008; Corbin et al.,\n2012), while its qualitative pattern depends more on the genetic\ninformation than on data manipulation.\nSo far this method has been applied using a variety of software,\nno standardized approach exists to bin the results and each stud y\nhas applied a more or less arbitrary approach, e.g., binning for\ngeneration classes in the past (\nCorbin et al., 2012 ), binning for\ndistance classes with a constant range for each bin ( Kijas et al.,\n2012) or binning per distance classes in a linear fashion but with\nlarger bins for the more recent time points ( Burren et al., 2014 ).\nTo our knowledge the only software available that estimate Ne\nthrough LD is NeEstimator ( Do et al., 2014 ), an upgraded ver-\nsion of the former LDNE ( Waples and Do, 2008 ) allowing the\nanalysis of large dataset (as 50k SNPChip). Importantly, while\nSNeP focuses on estimating historical Ne trends, NeEstimator’s\naim is to produce contemporary unbiased Ne estimates, the lat-\nter should therefore be considered as a complementary tool whi le\ninvestigating demography through LD.\nWe used SNeP to analyze two datasets where the method\nwas previously applied. The results we obtained for the sheep\ndata were both quantitatively and qualitatively comparable with\nthose obtained by\nBurren et al. (2014) , while for the Zebu data\nwe obtained a Ne trend estimate that closely matched that of\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 109\nBarbato et al. SNeP: a tool to estimate Ne\nFIGURE 3 | Comparison ofNe trends for the last 250 generations in the SHZ data obtained byMbole-Kariuki et al. (2014)(dashed line) and usingSNeP\n(solid line).\nMbole-Kariuki et al. (2014) although our point estimates of Ne\nwere larger than those described for the data ( Mbole-Kariuki\net al., 2014 ). The discrepancy between these two results reﬂects\nthat Burren and colleagues produced their r2 estimates using\nPLINK (the standard software for large scale SNP data manip-\nulation) which uses the same approach used to estimate r2 by\nSNeP, while Mbole-Kariuki et al. followed\nHao et al. (2007) for\nr2 estimation. The use of diﬀerent estimates for LD is critical\nfor the quantitative aspect of the Ne curve, where due to the\nhyperbolic correlation between Ne and r2, a decrease in r2 on\nits range closer to 0 can lead to a very large change in Ne esti-\nmates, while diﬀerences in estimates are less signiﬁcant whe n\nthe r2 value is high, i.e., closer to 1. Therefore, although in\none of the datasets the Ne values where substantially diﬀerent,\nin both cases the Ne curves overlapped with those originally\npublished.\nAs already suggested by other authors, the reliability of th e\nquantitative estimates obtained with this method must be ta ken\nwith caution, especially for Ne values related to the most recent\nand the oldest generations ( Corbin et al., 2012 ) because for recent\ngenerations, large values of c are involved, not ﬁtting the theo-\nretical implications that Hayes proposed to estimate a variabl e\nNe over time ( Hayes et al., 2003 ). Estimates for the oldest gen-\nerations might also be unreliable as coalescent theory show s that\nno SNP can be reliably sampled after 4 Ne generations in the past\n(Corbin et al., 2012 ). Further, Ne estimates, and especially those\nrelated to generations further in the past, are strongly aﬀect ed by\ndata manipulation factors, such as the choice of MAF and alpha\nvalues. Additionally, the binning strategy applied can interf ere\nwith the general precision of the method, for example where an\ninsuﬃcient number of pairwise comparisons are used to populate\neach bin.\nOne of the applications of method is to compare breed\ndemographies. In this case the shape of the Ne curves would be\nthe optimal tool to diﬀerentiate diﬀerent demographic historie s,\nmore than their numerical values, by using them as a potential\ndemographic ﬁngerprint for that breed or species, yet taking in to\nconsideration that mutation, migration, and selection can inﬂu-\nence the Ne estimation through LD (\nWaples and Do, 2010 ). Addi-\ntionally, careful consideration of the data analyzed with SNeP\n(and other software to estimate Ne) is very important, as the pres-\nence of confounding factors such as admixture, may result in\nbiased estimates of Ne (\nOrozco-terWengel and Bruford, 2014 ).\nThe aim of SNeP is therefore to provide a fast and reliable tool\nto apply LD methods to estimate Ne using high throughput geno-\ntypic data in a more consistent way. It allows two diﬀerent r2\nestimation approaches plus the option of using r2 estimates from\nexternal software. The use of SNeP does not overcome the limits\nof the method and the theory behind it, yet it allows the user to\napply the theory using all corrections suggested to date.\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 109\nBarbato et al.
