FMT shows superior performance over previously proposed models, setting\nnew state of the art in the studied datasets.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nIn many naturally occurring scenarios, our perception of the world is multimodal. For example,\nconsider multimodal language (face-to-face communication), where modalities of language, vision\nand acoustic are seamlessly used together for communicative intent (Kottur et al., 2019). Such\nscenarios are widespread in everyday life, where continuous sensory perceptions form multimodal\nsequential data. Each modality within multimodal data exhibits exclusive intramodal dynamics, and\npresents a unique source of information. Modalities are not fully independent of each other. Relations\nacross two (bimodal) or more (trimodal, . . . ) of them formintermodal dynamics; often asynchronous\nspatio-temporal dynamics which bind modalities together (Zadeh et al., 2017).\nLearning from multimodal sequential data has been an active, yet challenging research area within\nthe ﬁeld of machine learning (Baltru ˇsaitis et al., 2018). Various approaches relying on graphical\nmodels or RNNs have been proposed for multimodal sequential learning. Transformer models\nare a new class of neural models that rely on a carefully designed non-recurrent architecture for\nsequential modeling (Vaswani et al., 2017). Their superior performance is attributed to a self-attention\nmechanism, which is uniquely capable of highlighting related information across a sequence. This\nself-attention is a particularly appealing mechanism for multimodal sequential learning, as it can\nbe modiﬁed into a strong neural component for ﬁnding relations between different modalities (the\ncornerstone of this paper). In practice, numerous such relations may simultaneously exist within\nmultimodal data, which would require increasing the number of attention units (i.e. heads). Increasing\n1\narXiv:1911.09826v1  [cs.LG]  22 Nov 2019\nthe number of attentions in an efﬁcient and semantically meaningful way inside a transformer model,\ncan boost the performance in modeling multimodal sequential data.\nIn this paper, we present a new transformer model for multimodal sequential learning, called Fac-\ntorized Multimodal Transformer (FMT). FMT is capable of modeling asynchronous intramodal\nand intermodal dynamics in an efﬁcient manner, within one single transformer network. It does\nso by speciﬁcally accounting for possible sets of interactions between modalities (i.e. factorizing\nbased on combinations) in a Factorized Multimodal Self-attention (FMS) unit. We evaluate the\nperformance of FMT on multimodal language: a challenging type of multimodal data which exhibits\nidiosyncratic and asynchronous spatio-temporal relations across language, vision and acoustic modal-\nities. FMT is compared to previously proposed approaches for multimodal sequential learning over\nmultimodal sentiment analysis (CMU-MOSI) (Zadeh et al., 2016), multimodal emotion recognition\n(IEMOCAP) (Busso et al., 2008), and multimodal personality traits recognition (POM) (Park et al.,\n2014).\n2 R ELATED WORKS\nThe related works to studies in this paper fall into two main areas.\n2.1 M ULTIMODAL SEQUENTIAL LEARNING\nModeling multimodal sequential data is among the core research areas within the ﬁeld of machine\nlearning. In this area, previous work can be classiﬁed into two main categories.\nThe ﬁrst category of models, and arguably the simplest, are models that use early or late fusion.\nEarly fusion uses feature concatenation of all modalities into a single modality. Subsequently, the\nmultimodal sequential learning task is treated as a unimodal one and tackled using unimodal sequential\nmodels such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Baum & Petrie, 1966), Hidden Conditional Random\nFields (HCRFs) (Quattoni et al., 2007; Morency et al., 2007), and RNNs (e.g. LSTMs Hochreiter &\nSchmidhuber (1997)). While such models are often successful for real unimodal data (i.e. not feature\nconcatenated multimodal data), they lack the necessary components to deal with multimodal data\noften causes suboptimal performance (Xu et al., 2013). Contrary to early fusion which concatenates\nmodalities at input level, late fusion models have relied on learning ensembles of weak classiﬁers\nfrom different modalities (Snoek et al., 2005; Vielzeuf et al., 2017; Nojavanasghari et al., 2016).\nHybrid methods have also been used to combine early and late fusion together (Wu et al., 2019;\nNguyen & Okatani, 2018; Lazaridou et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2017).\nThe second category of models comprise of models speciﬁcally designed for multimodal data.\nMultimodal variations of graphical models have been proposed, including Multi-view HCRFs where\nthe potentials of the HCRF are changed to facilitate multiple modalities Song et al. (2012; 2013).\nMultimodal models based on LSTMs include Multi-view LSTMs Rajagopalan et al. (2016), Memory\nFusion Network (Zadeh et al., 2018a) with its recurrent and graph variants (Liang et al., 2018;\nZadeh et al., 2018c), as well as Multi-attention Recurrent Networks (Zadeh et al., 2018b). Studies\nhave also proposed generic fusion techniques that can be used in various models including Tensor\nFusion (Zadeh et al., 2017) and its approximate variants (Liang et al.; Liu et al., 2018), as well as\nCompact Bilinear Pooling (Gao et al., 2015; Fukui et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016).\nMany of these models, from both ﬁrst and second categories, are used as baselines in this paper.\n2.2 T RANSFORMER MODEL\nTransformer is a non-recurrent neural architecture designed for modeling sequential data (Vaswani\net al., 2017). It has shown superior performance across multiple NLP tasks when compared to\nRNN-based or convolutional architectures (Devlin et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2017). This superior\nperformance of Transformer model is largely credited to a self-attention; a neural component that\nallows for efﬁciently extracting both short and long-range dependencies within its input sequence\nspace. Transformer models have been successfully applied to various areas within machine learning\nincluding NLP and computer vision (Yang et al., 2019; Parmar et al., 2018; Alsentzer et al., 2019).\nExtending transformer to multimodal domains, specially for structured multimodal sequences is\nrelatively understudied; with the previous works mainly focusing on using transformer models for\n2\nmodality alignment using cross-modal links between single transformers for each modality (Tsai\net al., 2019).\n3 F ACTORIZED MULTIMODAL TRANSFORMER (FMT) M ODEL\nIn this section, we outline the proposed Factorized Multimodal Transformer1 (FMT). Figure 1 shows\nthe overall structure of the FMT model. The input ﬁrst goes through an embedding layer, followed by\nmultiple Multimodal Transformer Layers (MTL). Each MTL consists of multiple Factorized Multi-\nmodal Self-attentions (FMS). FMS explicitly accounts for intramodal and intermodal factors within\nits multimodal input. S1 and S2 are two summarization networks. They are necessary components\nof FMT which allow for increasing the number of attentions efﬁciently, without overparameterization\nof the FMT.\n3.1 I NPUT EMBEDDING\nMultimodal Transformer Layer (MTL)𝐾×\nEmbeddingInput    (𝑥%)\nOutput     ('𝑥%()\n𝑆1 …\n…\n…\nFactorized Multimodal Self-attention (FMS)\n𝑆2FFFFFFFFAdd & Norm\nFigure 1: Overview of the proposed Fac-\ntorized Multimodal Transformer (FMT)\nmodel.\nConsider a multimodal sequential dataset with constituent\nmodalities of language, vision and acoustic. The modali-\nties are denoted as {L, V, A}from hereon for abbreviation.\nAfter resampling using a reference clock, modalities can\nfollow the same frequency (Chen et al., 2017). Essentially,\nthis resampling is often based on word timestamps (i.e.\nword alignment). Subsequently, the dataset can be denoted\nas:\nD =\n{\nxi =\n[\nx(t,i) = ⟨l(t,i), v(t,i), a(t,i)⟩\n]t=Ti\nt=1 , yi\n}N\ni=1\nxi ∈RTi×dx, yi ∈Rdy are the inputs and labels. x(t,i) =\n⟨l(t,i), v(t,i), a(t,i)⟩is a triplet of language, visual and audio\ninputs for timestamp t in i-th datapoint. N is the total\nnumber of samples within the dataset, and Ti the total\nnumber of timestamps within i-th datapoint. Zero paddings\n(on the left) can be used to unify the length of all sequences\nto a desired ﬁxed length T. dx = dL + dV + dA denotes\nthe dimensionality of input at each timestep, which in turn\nis equal to the sum of dimensionality of each modality. dy\ndenotes the dimensionality of the associated labels of a\nsequence.\nAt the ﬁrst step within the FMT model, each modality is\npassed to a unimodal embedding layer with the operation\nEM∈{L,V,A}(·); RdM∈{L,V,A} ↦→ReM∈{L,V,A}. In turn, EM takes as input m(t,i); m ∈{l, v, a}. Positional\nembeddings are also added to the input at this stage. The output of the embeddings collectively form\nˆx0 = ⟨ˆl0, ˆv0, ˆa0⟩. We denote the dimensionality of this output as ex = eL + eV + eA.\n3.2 M ULTIMODAL TRANSFORMER LAYER (MTL)\nAfter the initial embedding, FMT now consists of a stack of Multimodal Transformer Layers (MTL).\nMTL 1) captures factorized dynamics within multimodal data in parallel, and 2) aligns the time-\nasynchronous information both within and across modalities. Both of these are achieved using\nmultiple Factorized Multimodal Self-attentions (FMS), each of which has multiple specialized self-\nattentions inside. The high dimensionality of the intermediate attention outputs within MTL and FMS\nis controlled using two distinct summarization networks. The continuation of this section provides\ndetailed explanation of the inner-operations of MTL.\nLet ˆxk\ni = ⟨ˆlk\n(·,i), ˆvk\n(·,i), ˆak\n(·,i)⟩denote the input to the k-th MTL. We assume a total of K MTLs in a\nFMT (indexed 0 . . . K−1), with k = 0being the output of the embedding layer (input tok = 0MTL).\n1Code (release April 15th, 2020): https://github.com/A2Zadeh/Factorized-Multimodal-Transformer, Public\nData: https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK\n3\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n. . . \n. . . \n[L][V][A][L,V][L,A][V,A][L,V,A]\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nSA L,V,ASA V,ASA L,ASA L,VSA ASA VSAL\nAdd &Norm𝑆1\n#𝑥(&)()𝑙(+,&)( #𝑣(+,&)( #𝑎(+,&)( )𝑙(/,&)( #𝑣(/,&)( #𝑎(/,&)( )𝑙(𝒯,&)( #𝑣(𝒯,&)( #𝑎(𝒯,&)( Factorized Multimodal Self-attention (FMS)\nOutput (to MTL)\nFigure 2: Best viewed in color. Overview of a single Factorized Multimodal Self-attention (FMS) in\nk-th MTL. SA is self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) with full time-domain receptive ﬁeld (0 . . .T).\nThe grayed areas are for demonstration purposes, and not a part of the implementation.\nThe input of MTL, immediately goes through one/multiple2 Factorized Multimodal Self-attentions\n(FMS). The operations inside a single Factorized Multimodal Self-attention is demonstrated in Figure\n2. For 3 modalities3, there exist 7 distinct attentions inside a single FMS unit. Each attention has a\nunique receptive ﬁeld with respect to modalities f ∈F = {L,V,A,LV,LA,VA,LVA}; essentially\ndenoting the modalities visible to the attention. Using this factorization, FMS explicitly accounts for\npossible unimodal, bimodal and trimodal interactions existing within the multimodal input space. All\nattentions within a FMS extend to the length of the sequence, and therefore can extract asynchronous\nrelations within and across modalities. For f ∈F, each attention within a single FMS unit is\ncontrolled by the Key Kf , Query Qf , and Value V f all with dimensionality RT×T ; parameterized\nrespectively using afﬁne maps WKf , WQf , and WV f . After the attention is applied using Key,\nQuery and Value operations (Vaswani et al., 2017), the output of each of the attentions goes through\na residual addition with its perceived input (input in the attention receptive ﬁeld), followed by a\nnormalization.\nThe output of the FMS contains the aligned and extracted information from the unimodal, bimodal\nand trimodal factors. This output is high-dimensional; essentially R4×T×ex (each dimension within\ninput of shape T× ex is present in 4 factors). Our goal is to reduce this high-dimensional data using a\nmapping from R4×T×ex ↦→RT×ex. Without overparameterizing the FMS, in practice, we observed\nthis mapping can be efﬁciently done using a simple 1D convolutional network S1M∈{L,V,A}(·); R4 ↦→\nR. Internally, S1(·) maps its input to multiple layers of higher dimensions and subsequently to R.\nUsing language as an example, S1L moves across language modality dimensions eL for t = 1. . .T\nand summarizes the information across all the factors. The output of this summarization applied on\nall modality dimensions and timesteps, is the output of FMS, which has the dimensionality RT×ex.\nIn practice, there can be various possible unimodal, bimodal or trimodal interactions within a\nmultimodal input. For example, consider multiple sets of important interactions between L and V (e.g.\nsmile + positive word, as well as eyebrows up + excited phrase), all of which need to be highlighted\nand extracted. A single FMS may not be able to highlight all these interactions without diluting its\nintrinsic attentions. Multiple FMS can be used inside a MTL to efﬁciently extract diverse multimodal\n2Multiple FMS have the same time-domain receptive ﬁeld, which is equal to the length of the input. This is\ncontrary to the implementations of the transformer model that split the sequence based on number of attention\nheads.\n3Remarks on more than 3 modalities is in Appendix A.4.\n4\nModel \\Metric BA F1 MAE Corr\nMV-LSTM (Rajagopalan et al., 2016) 73.9/– 74.0/– 1.019 0.601\nTFN (Zadeh et al., 2017) 73.9/– 73.4/– 1.040 0.633\nMARN (Zadeh et al., 2018b) 77.1/– 77.0/– 0.968 0.625\nMFN (Zadeh et al., 2018a) 77.4/– 77.3/– 0.965 0.632\nRMFN (Liang et al., 2018) 78.4/– 78.0/– 0.922 0.681\nRA VEN (Wang et al., 2018) 78.0/– –/– 0.915 0.691\nMulT (Tsai et al., 2019) –/83.0 –/82.8 0.87 0.698\nFMT (ours) 81.5/83.5 81.4/83.5 0.837 0.744\nTable 1: FMT achieves superior performance over baseline models for CMU-MOSI dataset (mul-\ntimodal sentiment analysis).

The output\nof each FMS goes through a feedforward network (for each timestamp t of the FMS output). The\noutput of this feedfoward network is residually added with its input, and subsequently normalized.\nThe feedforward network is the same across all U FMS units and timestamps t. Subsequently, the\ndimensionality of the output of the normalizations collectively is RU×T×ex. Similar to operations\nperformed by S1, a secondary summarization network S2M∈{L,V,A}(·); RU ↦→R can be used here.\nS2 is also a 1D convolutional network that moves across modality dimensions and different timesteps\nto map RU×T×ex to RT×ex.

For supervision, we feed this\ninput one timestamp at a time as input to a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014). The\nprediction is conditioned on output at timestamp t = T of the GRU, using an afﬁne map to dy.\n4 E XPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we discuss the experimental methodology including tasks, datasets, computational\ndescriptors, and comparison baselines.\n4.1 T ASKS AND DATASETS\nThe following inherently multimodal tasks (and accompanied datasets) are studied in this paper. All\nthe tasks are related to multimodal language: a complex and idiosyncratic sequential multimodal\nsignal, where semantics are arbitrarily scattered across modalities (Holler & Levinson, 2019).\nMultimodal Sentiment Analysis: The ﬁrst benchmark in our experiments is multimodal sentiment\nanalysis, where the goal is to identify a speaker’s sentiment based on the speaker’s display of verbal\nand nonverbal behaviors. We use the well-studied CMU-MOSI (CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment\nIntensity) dataset for this purpose (Zadeh et al., 2016). There are a total of 2199 data points (opinion\nutterances) within CMU-MOSI dataset. The dataset has real-valued sentiment intensity annotations\nin the range [−3, +3]. It is considered a challenging dataset due to speaker diversity (1 video per\ndistinct speaker), topic variations and low-resource setup.\nMultimodal Emotion Recognition: The second benchmark in our experiments is multimodal emotion\nrecognition, where the goal is to identify a speaker’s emotions based on the speaker’s verbal and\nnonverbal behaviors. We use the well-studied IEMOCAP dataset (Busso et al., 2008).

It is a particularly difﬁcult task, with\n16 different speaker traits in total. We study the POM dataset which contains 1,000 movie review\nvideos (Park et al., 2014). Each video is annotated for various personality and speaker traits,\nspeciﬁcally: Conﬁdent (Con), Passionate (Pas), V oice Pleasant (V oi), Dominant (Dom), Credible\n(Cre), Vivid (Viv), Expertise (Exp), Entertaining (Ent), Reserved (Res), Trusting (Tru), Relaxed (Rel),\nOutgoing (Out), Thorough (Tho), Nervous (Ner), Persuasive (Per) and Humorous (Hum). The short\nform of these speaker traits is indicated inside the parentheses and used for the rest of this paper.\n4.2 M ULTIMODAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTORS\nThe following computational descriptors are used by FMT and baselines (all the baselines use the\nsame descriptors in their original respective papers).\n6\nLanguage: P2FA forced alignment model (Yuan & Liberman, 2008) is used to align the text and\naudio at word level. From the forced alignment, the timing of words and sentences are extracted.\nWord-level alignment is used to unify the modality frequencies (Chen et al., 2017). GloVe embed-\ndings (Pennington et al., 2014) are subsequently used for word representation.\nVisual: For the visual modality, the Emotient FACET (iMotions, 2017) is used to extract a set of\nvisual features including Facial Action Units (Ekman et al., 1980), visual indicators of emotions, and\nsparse facial landmarks.\nAcoustic: COV AREP (Degottex et al., 2014) is used to extract the following features: fundamental\nfrequency, quasi open quotient (Kane & Gobl, 2013), normalized amplitude quotient, glottal source\nparameters (H1H2, Rd, Rd conf) (Drugman et al., 2012), V oiced/Unvoiced segmenting features\n(VUV) (Drugman & Alwan, 2011), maxima dispersion quotient (MDQ), the ﬁrst 3 formants, parabolic\nspectral parameter (PSP), harmonic model and phase distortion mean (HMPDM 0-24) and deviations\n(HMPDD 0-12), spectral tilt/slope of wavelet responses (peak/slope), Mel Cepstral Coefﬁcients\n(MCEP 0-24).\n4.3 B ASELINE MODELS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe following strong baselines are compared to FMT: MV-LSTM (Multi-view LSTM, Rajagopalan\net al. (2016)), TFN (Tensor Fusion Network, Zadeh et al. (2017)), MARN (Multi-attention Recurrent\nNetwork, Zadeh et al. (2018b)) , MFN (Memory Fusion Network, Zadeh et al. (2018a)) , RAVEN\n(Recurrent Attended Variation Embedding Network, Wang et al. (2018)), MulT5 (Multimodal Trans-\nformer for [Un]aligned Sequences, Tsai et al. (2019)). There are fundamental distinctions between\nFMT and MulT, chief among them: 1) MulT consists of 6 transformers, 3 cross-modal transformers\nand 3 unimodal. Naturally this increases the overall model size substantially. FMT consists of\nonly one transformer, with components to avoid overparameterization. 2) FMT sees interactions as\nundirected (unlike MulT which has L →V and V →L), and therefore semantically combines two\nattentions in one. 3) MulT has no trimodal factors (which are important according to Section 5). 4)\nMulT has no direct unimodal path (e.g. only L), as input to unimodal transformers are outputs of\ncross-modal transformers. 5) All FMT attentions have full time-domain receptive ﬁeld, while MulT\nsplits the input based on the heads.\nIn their original publication, all the models report6 the performance over the datasets in Section 4.1,\nusing the same descriptors discussed in Section 4.2. The models in this paper are compared using the\nfollowing performance measures (depending on the dataset): (BA) denotes binary accuracy - higher is\nbetter, (MA5,MA7) are 5 and 7 multiclass accuracy - higher is better, (F1) denotes F1 score - higher\nis better, (MAE) denotes the Mean-Absolute Error - lower is better, (Corr) is Pearson Correlation\nCoefﬁcient - higher is better. The hyperparameter space search for FMT (and baselines if retrained)\nis discussed in Appendix A.1.\n5 R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe results of sentiment analysis experiments on CMU-MOSI dataset are presented in Table 1.\nFMT achieves superior performance than the previously proposed models for multimodal sentiment\nanalysis. We use two approaches for calculating BA and F1 based on negative vs. non-negative\nsentiment (Zadeh et al., 2018b) on the left side of /, and negative vs. positive (Tsai et al., 2019) on\nthe right side. MAE and Corr are also reported. For multimodal emotion recognition, experiments on\nIEMOCAP are reported in Table 2. The performance of FMT is superior than other baselines for\nmultimodal emotion recognition (with the exception of Happy emotion). The results of experiments\nfor personality traits recognition on POM dataset are reported in Table 3. We report MA5 and MA7,\ndepending on the label. FMT outperforms baselines across all personality traits.\nWe study the importance of the factorization in FMT. We ﬁrst remove the unimodal, bimodal and\ntrimodal attentions from the FMT model, resulting in 3 alternative implementations of FMT. Table 4\n5We use the aligned variant of MulT model, which has shown better performance than unaligned version in\nthe original paper.\n6With the exception of MulT for POM dataset, which is not reported in original paper. It is trained in this\npaper using authors’ provided github code with hyperparameter search in Appendix A.1.\n7\nModel \\Metric BA F1 MAE Corr\nFMT [UNI] 80.6/82.8 80.5/82.8 0.868 0.719\nFMT [BI] 81.2/81.7 81.2/81.6 0.877 0.706\nFMT [TRI] 80.2/81.6 80.2/81.5 0.874 0.705\nFMT [L] 77.7/79.6 77.7/79.6 0.935 0.666\nFMT [A] 62.5/62.7 62.6/73.2 1.338 0.306\nFMT [V] 59.3/59.3 59.4/72.7 1.357 0.218\nFMT [S] 80.3/82.0 80.3/81.9 0.860 0.734\nFMT 81.5/83.5 81.4/83.5 0.837 0.744\nTable 4: FMT ablation studies on CMU-MOSI dataset.

The number in the square bracket indicates the number of FMS. The total number of attention\nis 7 times the number in bracket.\ndemonstrates the results of this ablation experiment over CMU-MOSI dataset. Furthermore, we use\nonly one modality as input for FMT, to understand the importance of each modality (all other factors\nremoved). We also replace the summarization networks with simple vector addition operation. All\nfactors, modalities, and summarization components are needed for achieving best performance.\nWe also perform experiments to understand the effect of number of FMT units within each MTL.\nTable 5 shows the performance trend for different number of FMT units. The model with 6 number\nof FMS (42 attentions in total) achieves the highest performance (6 is also the highest number we\nexperimented with). Tsai et al. (2019) reports the best performance for CMU-MOSI dataset is\nachieved when using 40 attentions per cross-modal transformer (3 of each, therefore 120 attention,\nwithout counting the subsequent unimodal transformers). FMT uses fewer number of attentions\nthan MulT, yet achieves better performance. We also experiment with number of heads for original\ntransformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) and compare to FMT (Appendix A.3).\n6 C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we presented the Factorized Multimodal Transformer (FMT) model for multimodal\nsequential learning. Using a Factorized Multimodal Self-attention (FMS) within each Multimodal\nTransformer Layer (MTL), FMT is able to model the intra-model and inter-modal dynamics within\nasynchronous multimodal sequences. We compared the performance of FMT to baselines approaches\nover 3 publicly available datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis (CMU-MOSI, 1 label), emotion\nrecognition (IEMOCAP, 4 labels) and personality traits recognition (POM, 16 labels). Overall, FMT\nachieved superior performance than previously proposed models across the studied datasets.\n8\nREFERENCES\nEmily Alsentzer, John Murphy, William Boag, Wei-Hung Weng, Di Jindi, Tristan Naumann, and Matthew McDer-\nmott.

The same parameters (when applicable) are used for\ntraining MulT for POM dataset (e.g. num encoder layers same as number of MTL). Furthermore, for\nMulT speciﬁc hyperparameters, we use similar values as Table 5 in the original paper. All models\nare trained for a maximum of 200 epochs. The hyperparameter validation is similar to Zadeh et al.\n(2018b).\nA.2 N UMBER OF MTL\nWe study the effect of number of MTL on FMT performance. Table 6 shows the results of this\nexperiment. The best performance is achieved using 8 MTL layers (which was also the maximum\nlayers we tried in our hyperparameter search).\nA.3 N UMBER OF ATTENTION HEADS FOR ORIGINAL TRANSFORMER MODEL\nIn this section, we discuss the effect of increasing the number of heads on the original transformer\nmodel (OTF, Vaswani et al. (2017)). Please note that we implement the OTF to allow for all attention\nheads to have full input receptive ﬁeld (from1 . . .T), similar to FMT. We increase the attention heads\nfrom 1 to 35 (after 35 does not ﬁt on a Tesla-V100 GPU with batchsize of 20). Table 7 shows the\nresults of increasing number of attention heads for both models. We observe that achieving superior\nperformance is not a matter of increasing the attention heads. Even using 1 FMS unit, which leads to\n7 total attention, FMT achieves higher performance than counterpart OTF.\nA.4 T RAINING REMARKS FOR MORE THAN 3 MODALITIES\nIn many scenarios in nature, as well as what is currently pursued in machine learning, the number of\nmodalities goes as high as 3 (mostly language, vision and acoustic, as studied in this paper). This leads\nto 7 attentions within each FMS, well manageable for successful training of FMT as demonstrated in\nthis paper. However, as the number of modalities increases, the underlying multimodal phenomena\nbecomes more challenging to model. This causes complexities for any competitive multimodal\nmodel, regardless of their internal design. While studying these cases are beyond the scope of\nthis paper, due to rare nature of having more than 3 main modalities modalities, for FMT, the\ncomplexity can be managed due to the factorization in FMS. We propose two approaches: 1) for\nhigh number of modalities, the involved factors can be reduced based on domain knowledge, the\nnature of the problem, and the assumed dependencies between modalities (e.g. removing factors\nbetween modalities that are deemed weakly related). Alternatively, without making assumptions\nModel \\Metric MAE Corr\nFMT [2] 0.881 0.720\nFMT [3] 0.876 0.727\nFMT [4] 0.871 0.723\nFMT [5] 0.876 0.724\nFMT [6] 0.852 0.730\nFMT [7] 0.859 0.732\nFMT [8] 0.837 0.744\nTable 6: Multimodal sentiment analysis experiments with different number of MTL layers.

The number in the square\nbracket indicates the number of heads.\nabout inter-modality dependencies, a greedy approach may be taken for adding factors; an approach\nsimilar to stepwise regression (Kleinbaum et al., 1988), iteratively adding the next most important\nfactor. Using these two methods, the model can cope with higher number of modalities with a\ncontrollable compromise between performance and overparameterization.\n13",
